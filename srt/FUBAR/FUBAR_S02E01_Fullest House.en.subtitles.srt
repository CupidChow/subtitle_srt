But I should have taken your feelings
into consideration.

175
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,977
And I don't know,
I may have been a bit hasty.

176
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,146
Okay, all done. And it's fine.

177
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,525
You were right. I mean, being together
would've been a disaster.

178
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:49,278
Relationships in our line of work?
God, just look at my parents.

179
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,947
-Right?
-Right.

180
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,157
Spycraft is complicated enough.

181
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,243
[laughing] Can you imagine
if we were dumb enough

182
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,786
to get more involved with each other?

183
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,746
-It would've been totally stupid.
-Stupid.

184
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,166
Hey, I was gonna make some, um, pancakes.

185
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,960
Hey, Carter. What's up?

186
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,213
-I was just gonna make breakfast.
-Oh, that is so sweet of you.

187
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,757
-Um, I'm not hungry, but thank you.
-[Carter] Yeah.

188
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,133
-Well, hey, Carter.
-[Carter] Hey.

189
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,136
-Uh, I could kill a short stack.
-Yeah, great.

190
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,558
Well, with Luke and me, things are great.

191
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,437
Since we both got back together,
I could not be happier.

192
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,899
Tally, do you feel the same way?
Couldn't be happier?

193
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,609
I don't know. [exhales]

194
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,027
[light instrumental music playing]

195
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,531
It's Romi's birthday coming up,
and I've never missed one,

196
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,700
and I miss her so much.

197
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,910
And my son and daughter-in-law…

198
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,328
Well, I miss them too.

199
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,206
But witness protection
was our only choice, really,

200
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,083
so that Romi can go back to school.

201
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,126
I know,

202
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,461
but he asked if I could be happier.

203
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,630
And I could be.

204
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,092
Once the CIA has figured out
if there's anyone else out there

205
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,512
that is aware of our true identities,
or is after us,

206
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,805
we can move forward.

207
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,099
But how long would that take?

208
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,017
[phone vibrating]

209
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:02,935
What is it?

210
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,437
It's Dot.

211
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,064
She wants to meet in a small town
not too far away from here.

212
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,318
So maybe we'll see Romi
sooner than we think.

213
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,237
Is this it? Is it finally over?

214
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,615
If Dot wants to meet up,
it's gotta be good news, right?

215
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,366
[soft rock music playing]

216
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,703
Hi, Donnie.
Enjoyed some Cheetos for breakfast?

217
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,496
I don't know. Maybe.

218
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,415
You look like you blew the Lorax.

219
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,292
I don't know. Maybe.

220
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,793
You look terrible, man.

221
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,171
You have to listen to Tina
have sex with another man today?

222
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,839
-No.
-Then shut up.

223
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,134
-All right, I'm outta here.
-Whoa. Where do you think you're going?

224
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,303
To see Dot alone.

225
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,638
-Like hell you are.
-What?

226
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,431
Boss, we gotta be there to watch your six.

227
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,767
And your 12. And all the other numbers.

228
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,101
There are risks out there.

229
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,437
There's no reason
for all of us to take them.

230
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,856
Besides, Tally and Carter need protection.

231
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,774
And Donnie.

232
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,903
I guess.

233
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,572
Anyway, I'll be back.

234
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,618
In around two hours or so,
depending on traffic.

235
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,453
I'll be back.

236
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,790
[Dot] Luke, we have a serious threat.

237
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,167
-Dante Cress.
-The terrorist?

238
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,960
The dangerous nihilist

239
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,881
who believes that humanity
in its current form needs a radical reset

240
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,300
that begins with
a 90% population reduction.

241
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,218
[tense music playing]

242
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,720
Did someone figure out
the son of a bitch's identity?

243
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,264
No photo.
We don't know gender, nationality.

244
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,265
So we know nothing.

245
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,892
Latest chatter we picked up on him

246
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:29,021
is that he is now ready to take
this belief from theory to practice.

247
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,773
So, what makes you think I can help?

248
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,485
We've intercepted two terabytes
of encrypted communication.

249
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,612
Encrypted using the Greta Code.

250
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,489
How do you know about the Greta Code?

251
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,242
Because I know everything.

252
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,705
I knew you were using the Greta Code
to communicate with East German spies.

253
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,874
I knew some of it
was not sanctioned by the U.S.

254
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,751
I was trying to win the Cold War.

255
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,295
That's why I kept my mouth shut.
I trusted you.

256
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,047
Still do.

257
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,677
So I went to Merry Fitness
and dug out your old cryptex.

258
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,596
It doesn't operate
without your fingerprint.

259
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,686
We need you to decode
the messages we've intercepted

260
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,689
and figure out what Cress is up to.

261
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,274
[vehicle approaching]

262
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,944
[gun clicks]

263
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:17,987
Get down!

264
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,864
-[groans]
-[Luke] Dot!

265
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,866
[tires squealing]

266
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,492
[Dot whimpers]

267
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,704
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

268
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,290
[breathlessly] Do your job.

269
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,002
[man 1 groans]

270
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,924
[tires squealing]

271
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,851
-[tires squealing]
-[man 2 groans]

272
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,146
[gun firing]

273
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,522
[man 3 groans]

274
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,195
[music fades]

275
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,495
-I ordered you to stay in the safe house.
-Well, that was a bad order.

276
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,789
I had a feeling. Instinct.

277
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,999
[Luke] Oh, and you two listened to her.

278
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,918
If one of us was gonna get in trouble…

279
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,544
Might as well be all of us, boss.

280
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,712
[birds chirping]

281
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,423
Dot.

282
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,925
[somber music playing]

283
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,855
[dramatic music playing]

284
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,398
-That's not good.
-What?

285
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,819
My name is on it. Emma's, Barry's.

286
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:44,281
[sighs] Aliases, addresses,
all your photos.

287
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,326
Mom, Oscar, and his family, Carter.
Even Donnie.

288
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:52,164
-Looks like Boro did sell our information.
-Guys, looky-loos are coming up.

289
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,791
Local PD will be here soon.

290
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,751
We're just gonna leave Dot here?

291
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,796
Well, Dot would have ordered us to go,
so let's go.

292
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,007
[sirens wailing]

293
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,635
[man] Yeah.

294
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,053
No.

295
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,766
Well, it's a shit sandwich,
but one we're gonna have to swallow.

296
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,476
I think so.

297
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,771
Yeah. Uh-huh.

298
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,817
-That's right.
-[Luke sighs]

299
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,404
Holding up okay, man?

300
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,993
That bullet was meant for me.

301
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,997
What about you, Emma? How you doing?

302
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,040
Well, Dot wouldn't want us
sitting around crying.

303
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,584
She'd want us to get out there

304
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,836
and kick ass
on the case she died bringing to us.

305
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,672
Dante Cress and his radical reset plan?

306
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,134
Yeah, well, tell the 7th floor
we're moving as fast as we can, okay?

307
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,677
What's this guy's deal, anyway?

308
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,595
Reed?

309
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,264
[chuckles] He's from the Toledo office.

310
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,600
What about Dot's number two,
the Randolph guy?

311
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,809
Why wasn't he bumped up?

312
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,978
His wife got into
a car accident this morning,

313
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,980
so he's taking care of that.

314
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,692
So some out-of-town interloper
is our regional director?

315
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,611
[sighs] Okay.

316
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,323
First thing, Dot Okoye's body
was recovered by the agency,

317
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,783
and no one's judging you
for leaving her behind.

318
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,368
Really? It sounds like you are.

319
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,328
I'm sorry,

320
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,956
does the most junior operative here
have a thought she wants to share?

321
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,543
Okay, let's put aside the fact that
someone we worked with was killed today,

322
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,463
because the truth is, it's a miracle
more of us haven't eaten a bullet,

323
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:26,717
considering the massive shit field
this job drags us through at any moment.

324
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,012
But we belly crawl through those fields
because we love this job.

325
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:30,930
Almost every part.

326
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,973
-Wanna know what part I hate?
-Enlighten me.

327
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,268
It's knowing that we're the best
operational team the CIA has,

328
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,314
and we still have to answer
to know-nothing desk jockeys

329
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,691
who can't make the split-second decisions
we make every day,

330
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,027
who cannot do the job that we do,

331
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,072
but who still step into a situation
and open their mouths

332
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,575
when there's a 0% chance
something useful will come out.

333
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,702
I think she's talking about you.

334
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,829
Look, I'm sorry you don't like
my bedside manner,

335
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,247
but I've had a tough morning.

336
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,208
-[Emma scoffs]
-Well, we all had a tough morning.

337
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,584
Our friend got killed.

338
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,004
Mr. Reed, how can we be sure
no one knows where we are now?

339
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,215
I mean, if those guys found them
in some town square,

340
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,549
couldn't they find us here?

341
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,220
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to ask
the civilians to step out.

342
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,349
No, no, no. Their lives have been upended
because of the CIA.

343
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,560
-They've been part of this for months now.
-Fine, whatever.

344
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,062
To answer your question, ma'am,

345
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,648
the CIA was able to confirm
that the people who attacked today

346
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,983
were New Zealand smugglers.

347
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,402
Those boys were sent
from the Auckland crew? [chuckles]

348
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,738
Roo and I shut down an operation
that they were running years ago.

349
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,324
They must have bought your IDs
from Boro for payback.

350
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,702
Theory is they've been casing out
your various locations

351
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,661
these past few months,

352
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,123
and when Dot rushed over to Merry Fitness
to grab the cryptex for Luke,

353
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,457
she may have let her guard down.

354
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,127
So they followed her to the town square
to see who showed up.

355
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,546
Yes, but you left no one alive,
so no one followed you here.

356
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,631
So the safe house is still safe.

357
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,758
Yes, even if there are
other assassins in the US,

358
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,344
they have no way to find you here.
Here's the part you won't like.

359
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,304
I'm gonna need that jump drive
that Dot gave you

360
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,806
so another team can decode it.

361
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,057
That's not gonna happen.

362
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,393
How can you work a case
if it's dangerous to go outside?

363
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,521
Interim director,
let me make it perfectly clear.

364
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,149
There's no other team
that is going to work on this case

365
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,483
that got my friend killed.

366
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,821
And if you want to have that jump drive,
come and get it.

367
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,200
[suspenseful music builds, ends]

368
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,703
All right, decode the jump drive
and get to work.

[intriguing music playing]

370
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,626
Now, Barry, I need you to crack
the intercepted messages.

00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,796
[cryptex beeping]

372
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,968
Now, here's the key to the Greta Code.

373
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,345
Okay, write software to decipher it.

374
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,806
Do it fast and do it right.

375
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,726
-For Dot.
-Yes, sir. I'm on it.

376
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,894
[music fades]

377
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,523
[Tina] Dante Cress?

378
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,400
[Barry] According to Dot's intel.

379
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,194
I still can't believe Dot was killed.

380
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,403
Me either.

381
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:56,450
You know, it might be safer if I bring
anything I find to you in person.

382
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,995
I mean, if Dante Cress
is as powerful as everyone says he is,

383
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,040
who knows what
he could be listening to or reading?

384
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,000
I'd love nothing more
than to see you right now,

385
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,046
but you know I can't disclose our location
without proper authorization.

386
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,465
I know. I just miss you.

387
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,301
Encrypted phone calls
aren't doing it for me.

388
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,512
I love you.

389
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,513
I love you too.

390
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,681

393
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,777
[in Russian] I assume you heard
about Dot Okoye?

394
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,363
[in English] Of course. We are SVR.

395
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,074
We know when people die
before their hearts stop.

396
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,242
And use your English.

397
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,910
[in English] There's another thing.

398
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,539
They know Dante Cress
is planning something in the US.

399
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,790
Now, I know these people.

400
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,001
They get even half a clue that points
to him, they're gonna chase him down.

401
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,671
[Volek] That's a problem.
You can't let that happen.

402
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:55,926
But for now, Okoye's death has created
a moment of disorder in the CIA.

403
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,887
Disorder creates vulnerability.

404
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,765
Vulnerability creates opportunity.

405
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,183
So go.

ordinarily have access to.

[Tina] Farkas.

417

Um, well, I was leaving these here
as a memorial, but I couldn't find a vase.

418
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,973
And you thought you'd find one
in her laptop?

419

How'd you get in?

I'm working financials
on the Southeast African cases.

421
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,230
She gave me a copy of her card
so I could drop off files whenever I want.

422
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,232
It's top secret. Nothing emailed.

423
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,318
-How did you get in?
-Same.

424
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,696
Dot made me a copy of her card
for some joint work we're doing.

425

Were doing.

426
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,202
Actually, I'm here looking for a report
that we were finishing up.

427
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,204
I know Dot.

428
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,248
She would've wanted us to keep working.
Keep moving forward.

called taste and class.

done jackknifed into the overpass.

We don't do roadside memorials.

Can't help but notice you don't have any
Southeast African reports to leave here.

This is what Barry has found so far.

00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,822
Theodore Chips, former MI6 agent.

448
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,908
Hello, Mr. Chips. [chuckles]

449
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,951
Wow.

450
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,953
What? I'm gay. I'm not blind.

451
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,706
This guy is a snack.

452
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,875
His father is Horatio Chips,
acclaimed MI6 agent.

453
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,669
Died a few years ago in Rwanda.

454
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,130
Theo wanted to follow
in his dad's MI6 footsteps,

455
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,799
be a legend like his old man,
but they tossed him.

456
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,635
-What for?
-He's nuttier than squirrel shit.

457
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,347
He has no impulse control,
has no sense of reality or propriety.

458
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,348
What's he doing now?

459
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,433
[Luke] He got pissed off,

460
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,935
and he decided because
he couldn't do anything good for England

461
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,230
that he would do something bad
for any bad guy with a fat wallet.

An international evil TaskRabbit.

463
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,277
Now, the information
that Barry deciphered is troublesome.

464
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,573
Dante Cress has wired
a quarter of a billion dollars to Chips

465
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,783
to take out the entire United States grid.

466
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,618
Like a nationwide blackout?

467
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,495
[Luke] No, a blackout is temporary,

468
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,373
but Cress wants Chips
to turn out the lights for good.

469
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,666
Is that even possible?

470
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,667
Here.

[computer beeping]

472
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,754
This is the American power grid.

As you can see,
it's totally interconnected,

except for one area in Texas.

475
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,844
The Department of Energy believes
that with enough money and expertise,

476
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,221
you can destroy the entire grid.

477
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,307
I mean, lights out forever.

479
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,352
Cheese and crackers. What does that mean?

480
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:38,273
It means a collapse of the US economy,
which means the world economy.

481
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,483
[Roo] No transportation.

482
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,778
You can't get fuel refined or pumped
from the ground without electricity.

483
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,739
No food deliveries. Medicine can't go
where it's supposed to go.

484
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,491
Communication would grind to a halt.

485
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,202
Information couldn't get
to a terrified population.

486
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,663
And military weaponry
will cease to operate.

487
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,625
We'd be invaded within 48 hours.

488
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,212
End of this country
and our allies as we know it.

489
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,880
End of democracy.

490

to have your mom be a sex surrogate or…

495
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,101

496
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,435
Too bad. We got a case to win.

00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,313
Um, I downloaded the rest of the material
from the jump drive.

498

a lot sooner than we thought.

Beaumont Lake power plant.

500
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,320
It's carrying the electrical load
of the entire Eastern Grid Connection,

501
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,239
which is currently undergoing retrofit.

502
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,198
And that's bad how?

503
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,242
The retrofit makes Beaumont Lake
a temporary

504
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,244
but an extremely attractive target.

505
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,996
Chips is gonna hit it
from the inside with an EMP.

506
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,082
-What's that?
-An electromagnetic pulse

507
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,334
That is pushed out
with great force by an explosion.

508
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,088
It'll create a surge of energy that'll
take out not only the Eastern grid,

509
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,341
but it'll start a domino effect that'll
take out the Western Interconnection

510
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,759
and most of Texas.

511
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,971
A power outage that'll tear through
the U.S. like snot through a tissue.

512
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,723
And Cress will get the radical reset
that he always wanted.

513
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,600
All right.
I'm gonna go watch Franklin & Bash.

514
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,686
[Barry] According to the plans
that Dot intercepted,

515
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,146
he's hitting it today.

516
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,690
In four hours.

517
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,774
[tense music playing]

518
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,692
Oh shit.

519
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,153
Well, we're three and a half hours away
if we drive like hell.

520
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,488
No. If we all go out
into the world together,

521
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,240
we draw more attention to ourselves.

522
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,869
So no one leaves this house.
Everyone stays here and stays safe.

523
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,287
-[music ends]
-[Aldon] Hmm.

524
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,497
I'm gonna grab my go bag.

525
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,041
-Hitting the head. I'll meet you outside.
-I'm driving.

526
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:25,005
Dad… we've all been locked up together
in this house for months,

527
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,798
and it's made us wanna kill each other.

528
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,092
But it's also made us family.

529
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,096
No one goes it alone on this team.
All right?

530
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,098
Wheels up in 20 seconds.

531
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,392
[dramatic music playing]

532
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,395
I just… I just hate all of this stuff.

533
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,354
I know.

534
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,357
But it's not gonna be forever.

535
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,901
Look…

536
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,653
I'm gonna bring everyone home safe.

537
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,282
[music builds, ends]

538
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,161
[Klaxon blaring]

539
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:01,082
Klaxons are only used
for catastrophic events. Are we too late?

540
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,418
[Luke] Well, it's still working,
so the power's still on.

541
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,836
But this is a distraction.

542
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,588
Fire truck without firefighters?

543
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,547
Chips is smart.

544
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,966
He knows with a fire truck,
you can get anywhere.

545
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,469
I did the same thing in Antwerp
in the Diamond District.

546
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,386
[man] Can I help you?

547
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,472
One of our generators just overheated,

548
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,307
and there seems to be
a small internal fire,

549
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,600
so not really the best time.

550
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,644
We're with the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

551
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,854
The generator's fine, and there's no fire.

552
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,482
Your emergency's bullshit.
The warning system was hacked.

553
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,068
Those aren't firefighters.
We gotta get these people out of here.

554
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,195
Bad stuff is about to go down.

555
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,322
Get everyone out of here and call 911

556
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,241
and tell them to go
to the local fire station.

557
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,869
There was personnel there that got injured
when that fire truck was stolen.

558
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,205
-Now!
-Yeah, yeah.

559
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,249
I got thermal imagery
from the satellite feed.

560
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,626
Chips and his boys
are loading in the EMP now.

561
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,669
What's the ETA?

562
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,587
[Barry] Based on
the device schematics I pulled,

563
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,464
looks like 15 minutes
till fully functional.

564
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,383
What are we waiting for?
Let's go bust 'em up.

565
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,676
Blast doors are engaged.

566
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,470
By the time we get through,
Chips will have the whole country dark.

567
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,764
I'll drive that fire truck
right through those doors.

568
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,976
Fourteen-inch thick reinforced
industrial steel? No, you won't.

569
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,144
It's a thermal energy plant, right?

570
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,398
So it needs water intake
to act as a coolant.

571
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,067
We can get inside the plant
through the intake valve.

572
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,485
Barry, what's the water source?

573
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,530
Beaumont Lake is on the other side
of the ridge to the east.

574
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,408
But plant schematics show
a massive industrial propeller

575
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,410
that pulls water into the facility.

576
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,661
It'll rip you to chum.

577
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,122
Not if you turn it off, Uncle Barry.

578
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,123
Let's gear up.

579
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,333
[tense music playing]

580
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,503
These won't work underwater.

581
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,173
-Then we hold our breath.
-[Barry] The pipe is 80 yards long.

582
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,134
There's nowhere to come up
if you run out of air.

583
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,719
I don't know how to turn the fan off.

584
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,636
Just hack the system.

585
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,972
Chips was able to do it
to make the warning system go off.

586
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,308
The plant's warning system is online,
so it can communicate

587
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,977
to emergency personnel
like police and fire.

588
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,271
The rest of the system is air-gapped,

589
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,523
so there's no way
for me to turn the fan turbines off.

590
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,899
I don't like this idea.

591
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,110
You can figure anything out, Uncle Barry.
We trust you.

592
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,738
We'll get to the lake.
You stop the fan, B.

593
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,825
Luke, your phone and my phone
are on the same CIA sat-link.

594
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,743
Affirmative.

595
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,786
[Barry] I can take over your phone
from here.

596
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,081
And if your phone is hardwired
to any server in the plant,

597
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,418
it'll be just like any old computer
I can use to operate within their system.

598
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,837
Look around.
There should be a large antenna relay.

599
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,380
There's a tower 100 yards up.

600
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,633
[Barry] Okay, that feeds into the server
for the plant.

601
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,093
Go plug your phone in there,
and I can control the fans.

602
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,178
Well, it's locked up,

603
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,847
and Emma and Aldon took the bolt cutter.

604
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,475
-They didn't take the truck.
-[Klaxon blaring]

605

[tense music playing]

606
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,201
We're in the water.
You gotta turn off that propeller.

607
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,453
I can't until I'm linked up
to the plant's computer.

608
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,789
Do not go into the intake valve yet.

609
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,624
[Aldon] We can't wait.

610
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,543
Chips is minutes away
from shutting down the plant.

611
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,170
If you go far enough down that pipe,

612
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,297
the suction will pull you
to the fan if it isn't off.

613
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,883
[Aldon] Hey. Over there.

614
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,718
Gotta be the marker for the intake.

Good. Yours?

619
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,670
Fine.

620
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,173
Hey, look, if I run out of air down there,
you gotta keep going.

621
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,718
Same for me. If I get jammed up,
promise you'll keep going.

622
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,802
You have my word.

623
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,140
No way I'm leaving you down there.

Luke, I'm tracking Aldon and Emma's comms.

633
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,090
They're already in the intake pipe,
and they're moving way too fast.

634
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,184
Think they got caught up
in the intake stream. Hurry.

Don't worry, Mrs. B.

00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,963
Can you guess where I am?

687
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,757
No, but I know who you are.

688
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,301
Theodore Chips.

689
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,221
Unless one of your goons
has a standard RP accent

690
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,390
straight from the halls of Oxford.

691
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,307
[Chips chuckles]

692
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,103
[Chips] Very smart.
Shame I have to kill you now.

693
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,270
You'd have shot me by now,

694
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,315
but I'm guessing you can see
my gun's pointed at your EMP.

695
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,443
You shoot me, my finger jerks,

696
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,655
this thing dies with me,
and you're screwed.

697
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,366
[Chips] Oh my, my. You're very impressive.

698
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,578
So it seems we have
a bit of a standoff here, don't we?

699
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,164
Now, what do you do?

700
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,584
Well, you could come looking for me,
but then you'd have to leave the EMP,

701
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,670
and that's the only thing
keeping you alive.

702
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,631
Do you shoot the EMP? Well, you could.

703
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,050
But it's suicide,
'cause the second bullet fired

704
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,719
would be right into your skull.

705
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,141
You see, all these thoughts
just swirling, so distracting

706
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,684
that you don't realize

707
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,144
that I'm right here.

708
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,478
[tense music playing]

709
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:43,896
[Chips groans]

710
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,524
[both grunting]

711
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,077
[groans]

712
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,999
-[music fades]
-Dear Lord.

713
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,127
[both panting]

714
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,087
You're gorgeous.

715
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,798
[both grunting]

716
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,716
[Chips groans]

717
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,054
[Chips grunting]

718
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,021
[both grunting]

00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,149
[Emma grunts]

720
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,192
[Chips yells]

721
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,861
Stop-- [winces]

722
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,698
[Chips exhales]

723
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,617
[Chips exhales]

724
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,411
You know, if I may be so bold

725
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,082
and I can somehow persuade you
not to impale me right now,

726
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,710
I… I think it'd be nice for us
to get to know each other a bit better.

727
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,170
You know, perhaps dinner?

728
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,632
Of course, it'd have to be by candlelight
because no electric lights will work, so…

729
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,966
Are you serious?

730
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,052
[Emma grunts]

731
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,888
I'm always serious
when it comes to matters of the heart.

732
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,390
So do we have a deal?

733
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,767
Screw you.

734
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:04,936
[Chips groans]

735
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,856
It's a good idea, but we've got to
get to know each other a bit better first.

736
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,567
[Emma groaning]

737
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,239
[panting]

738
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,448
Damn it.

739
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,451
I look forward to dinner!

740
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,786
[tense music playing]

741
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,454
[breathing heavily]

742
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,623
Team, sound off.

743
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,127
Butch and Sundance accounted for.
We killed a lot of dudes.

744
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,671
-Emma, check in.
-[Emma] Still standing.

745
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,715
Chips got away
out of one of the upper-level windows.

746
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,552
But we got his EMP. Good work.

747
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,762
-Uh-oh.
-What is it?

748
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,847
It's activated.

749
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,181
[EMP beeping]

750
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,516
It's going off in three minutes.

751
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,811
We'll diffuse it. Barry,
walk him through all the techie stuff.

752
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,770
Not in three minutes.

753
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,106
We can't run it outside.
All the blast doors are down.

754
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,399
Go out the window Chips used.

755
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,484
The windows are too small.
The EMP won't fit.

756
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,862
Oh man. Poop's gonna hit the fan.

757
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,281
Speaking of which,
if you're gonna be using the bathroom,

758
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,324
I'd suggest you bring some matches.

759
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,951
Just did some damage.

760
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,412
Thing won't even flush.

761
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,663
[inspirational music playing]

762
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,789
That's it.

763
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,875
We flush it back out into the sea!

764
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,792
[tense music playing]

765
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,544
It should be me doing this.

766
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,463
No. Barry's gonna turn
the propellers back on again.

767
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,090
He's gonna double the RPMs,

768
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,760
which means everything
is gonna get pushed with tremendous force.

769
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,971
So this is about strength. I got this.

770
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,723
You're not staying when the fan's on.

771
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,475
-I have enough time to get out.
-[Aldon] Sixty seconds.

772
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,686
No way.
That fan is gonna shred your wheat.

773
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,104
I'm not gonna let that happen.

774
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,982
Is he really gonna do this?

775
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,192
He's already doing it.

776
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,568
I love you guys.

777
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,572
Okay, Barry, baby is in the bathwater.

778
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,699
[dramatic music playing]

779
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,870
-[computer whirring]
-[Tally] That bleep is Luke?

780
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,790
It's a comm in his ear. I'm tracking it.
Wherever it goes, Luke goes.

781
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,667
Are you sure this is gonna work?

782
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,837
Once the EMP is out of the pipe
and into the deep water of the lake,

783
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:58,382
the electromagnetic pulse can't travel
back into the plant and shut it down.

784
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,261
As long as the EMP leaves the pipe
and Luke doesn't, we're all good.

785
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,347
[tense music playing]

786
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,479
Starting up the fan in reverse.

787
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,273
-Mrs. B, you might wanna--
-I'm not going anywhere.

788
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,197
[grunts]

789
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,578
[grunting]

790
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,123
Luke's being pulled closer to the fan.

791
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,255
[muffled yelling]

792
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,133
[computer beeping]

793
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,302
-No! [breathing heavily]
-What? Barry?

794
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,512
What just happened?

795
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,814
The bomb detonated.
We all felt that, right?

796
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,775
Can you turn off the fan
so my dad can swim back up?

797
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,070
I already did, sweetheart.

798
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,196
Where is he?

799
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,614
[somber music playing]

800
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,619
Where's my dad, Uncle Barry?

801
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,294
Where is he? [sniffles]

802
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,629
Barry? Wha-- What happened?

803
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,932
-[gasps]
-[triumphant music playing]

804
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,892
-Yes!
-Yes! All right!

805
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,852
Dad!

806
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,437
[coughing]

[all laughing]

809
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,528
Tell Uncle Barry I need a new comm.

810
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,072
-It sucked it right out of my ear.
-[Tally laughs]

811
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,741
[Tally laughs, sniffles]

812
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,952
-[Barry exhales]
-[laughing]

813
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,581

[insects chirping]

00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,002
[cutlery clinking]

816
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,134
What's the matter, not hungry?

817
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,221
[sighs] I'm… I'm too amped up
from the power plant to eat.

818
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,769
Do you really think what I did back there
was Unit 9 level?

819
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,145
Absolutely.

820
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,275
As a matter of fact,
there's something I shouldn't disclose,

821
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,403
but it's been 25 years,
plus you're my daughter,

822
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,738
so to hell with it.

823
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,283
I was in Unit 9.

824
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,786
Are you serious?

825
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,871
I served an entire four-year tour.

826
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,625
I also know how difficult it is
to get in there.

827
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,168
[inspirational music playing]

828
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,669
It took me three tries.

829
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,797
Do you think I'm overshooting?

830
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,008
No, absolutely not. You're fantastic.

831
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,677
You just want to challenge yourself.

832
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,763
I do.

833
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,184
I wanna be the greatest operative
the CIA has ever had.

834
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,144
When they say
no one was better than Brunner,

835
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,521
I want them to mean both of us.

836
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,605
[Luke chuckles]

837
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:03,025
-Does that make me an asshole?
-That makes you my daughter.

838
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,111
[Luke exhales]

839
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,282
And I had Barry print this up.

840
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,411
It's the files from when I was in Unit 9.

841
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:18,791
There's case studies in there,
evaluations, reports.

842
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,251
I think it'd be very helpful.

843
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,419
[phone vibrating]

844
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,338
[phone unlocks]

845
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,173
Okay, here's an update.

846
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,135
Chips is nowhere to be found.

847
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,721
But the CIA did find the debris
from the EMP in the lake,

848
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,684
and the detonator has the signature wiring
of Bashir the Builder.

849
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,311
He built the device
used in the Partago assassination,

850
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,272
which was linked to Dante Cress.

851
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,358
That was in 2012,
and Chips was still in MI6 then,

852
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,902
so Bashir may have been dealing
with Cress directly.

853
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,030
Bashir, the bomb-maker out of India?
Like, that guy's a dick.

854
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,158
Well, it's a dick
you're gonna slap around.

855
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,286
Do you hear yourself?

856
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,204
Aldon, you're our only linguist.

857
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,499
You have to go to Kolkata and find Bashir,

858
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,960
and even get physical with him
if you have to.

859
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,962
Because he's directly connected
with Cress,

860
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,298
so I need to know everything
that Bashir knows.

861
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,382
Copy that.

862
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,260
And take Tina with you,
'cause she has family over there.

863
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,138
So if anyone gets suspicious
of you being there,

864
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,598
you have a good excuse by saying,

865
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,892
"Hey, I'm visiting the family
of my girlfriend."

866
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,810
I don't think that's safe.

867
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,729
India's not that dangerous.

868
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,440
I was talking about Tina and Aldon.

869
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,649
-Ouch.
-[phone chimes]

870
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,904
Oh man, look. The CIA intercepted
another message from Chips.

871
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,115
He's at the King's Well,
a boutique hotel in Prague.

872
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,576
Get your go bags. Out the door in two.

873
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,454
-I'll get the plane set up.
-No, wait, wait. You all just got back.

874
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,831
Now you have to go
risk your lives all over again?

875
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,041
That's our job.

876
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,461
I think I liked it better
when I didn't know what you were doing.

877
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,006
Sweetheart, we're all gonna
come back safe, okay?

878
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,717
-Love you.
-Love you too.

879
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,471
Bye, Mom. Love you.

880
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:56,805
Love you too.

881
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,433
-Bye, Mrs. B.
-Thank you, Mrs. B.

882
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,893
You smell like flowers.

883
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,228
[sighs]

884
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,813
[speaking Italian]

885
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,067
I can't believe it.
Luke wants me in the field.

886
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,945
And with Aldon.
There's so much he could teach me.

887
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,197
-That's what I'm afraid of.
-Huh?

888
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,490
-Nothin'.
-Listen.

889
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,326
I got a little proactive
and started looking into Dante Cress.

890
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:21,288
I checked into any past terrorist attacks
that have been attributed to Dante Cress.

891
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,667
I found one that has all the hallmarks
of a Dante Cress operation.

892
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,087
Now, prior to it, wire transfers
were made into bank accounts

893
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,880
near the situs of the attack.

894
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,676
Countless millions used to pay off thugs,
militants, sympathizers,

895
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,511
to help set up the bloodshed.

896
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,556
But after the bombing,
the account was abandoned.

897
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,934
Cress is a billionaire. All he cares about
is making a clean getaway.

898
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,395
If there were
a few million dollars left behind,

899
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,981
he wouldn't risk getting caught
trying to get his money back.

900
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,440
Exactly.

901
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:53,195
But I found nine other such accounts
related to unattributed terror activity.

902
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,197
All abandoned with money left in them.

903
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,199
You think they all are Dante Cress?

904
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,785
There is one common denominator.

905
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,831
The CIA took the lead on these
international terror investigations.

906
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,918
It was our job to secure
the abandoned funds, process them,

907
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,130
and eventually escheat them
to the Financial Action Task Force.

908
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,257
Now, the process could take a few years,

909
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,885
but eventually, when the FATF
comes looking for their cash,

910
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,179
they are not gonna be happy.

911
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,307
-Why?
-Because all the accounts are empty.

912
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,474
The money is gone.

913
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:23,892
And there's more.

914
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:28,772
All ten of these matters
were handled by the same CIA accountant.

915
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,357
Farkas.

916
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:36,447
Farkas is the one officer in the CIA
who's affiliated with all of these cases.

917
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,282
I know it sounds crazy,

918
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:42,661
but do you think maybe Farkas
could be working for Dante Cress?

919
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,831
Or maybe is Dante Cress?

920
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,417
-Farkas is a decorated officer, Tina.
-I know.

921
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,337
Look, someone
with Cress' ability and skill

922
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,339
would need to have access
to a lot of cash,

923
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:57,384
and Farkas handles
multi-billion-dollar accounts for the CIA.

924
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,137
Right now,
this is all just speculation, Tina.

925
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,766
Don't do anything crazy yet.

926
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,519
Keep digging.

927
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,480
Copy that.

928
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,523
[phone line beeping]

929
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,947
[Emma] Hey, I've been meaning to ask you,

930
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,201
the Greta Code thing,
why is it called that? Is that an acronym?

931
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,243
Oh, it doesn't matter.

932
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,830
I'm just trying to focus right now
on intercepting Chips

933
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,999
so he can direct us to Dante Cress

934
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,253
so we can wrap this whole thing up
and just get back to the safe house.

935
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:38,509
To eventually clear up the Boro mess
and then get out of the safe house, right?

936
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,426
That's right.

937
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,430
-You gonna be okay when that happens?
-Meaning what?

938
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,141
Meaning I've never seen you happier.

939
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,185
You've got everyone you love
under one roof.

940
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,730
Me, Mom, Uncle Barry, the team.

941
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,773
Not Donnie.

942
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,067
Yeah, not Donnie.

943
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,028
I'm happy because your mother and I
have never been better.

944
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,449
I can go and live with you again,
see my friends every day,

945
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:06,036
and then when we finish the whole thing,
get out of the safe house,

946
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,915
I can finally retire
and get your mother on the boat.

947
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,250
Ship.

948
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,502
Ship. Whatever.

949
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,004
Life couldn't be more perfect,
I can tell you that.

950
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:19,466
There will be no spy mission ever getting
between your mother and me again.

951
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,926
That's it, and that's all.

952
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:22,803
Yes, sir.

953
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,266
[gentle piano music playing]

954
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,600
[elevator dings]

955
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,313
[sinister music playing]

956
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,109
Hello, Luke.

957
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,036
It's been so long.

958
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,623
Greta.

959
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,171
Guess it's not an acronym.

960
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,423
