1
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:31,513
(Jung Ah and Eun Jin went to catch halibut early in the morning.)

2
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:33,584
(But the waves were so strong...)

3
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:35,554
(that they couldn't even balance.)

4
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:37,024
(Can we not fish?)

5
00:00:37,423 --> 00:00:41,123
(In the end, halibut fishing was canceled.)

6
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:42,923
(The four siblings' first risk of bankruptcy)

7
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:44,693
(We don't have money, but we need to invite a guest...)

8
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:46,433
(While they were worrying, their guest arrived.)

9
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:47,434
(Jung Ah.)

10
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:48,533
(You scared me!)

11
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,673
(Actor Park Hae Jin, Jung Ah's neighbor)

12
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:52,474
(The happy greetings didn't last long...)

13
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:53,674
(I'm hungry.)

14
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:54,943
(The four siblings are in trouble.)

15
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:56,504
(They negotiate with the staff to feed their guest.)

16
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:58,443
(We propose a competition with the staff.)

17
00:00:58,544 --> 00:01:00,243
(That's how Halibut Boat Sports Day began.)

18
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:01,743
(Confident)

19
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:03,714
(Let's go, halibut!)

20
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:05,683
(To win halibut and allowance, )

21
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:07,883
(they use all of their strength.)

22
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:11,854
(After a hard fight, the sibling team won.)

23
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:14,193
(They won a generous amount of halibut and allowance.)

24
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,523
(Should we do some cooking?)

25
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:18,493
(Was Hae Jin secretly a good cook all along?)

26
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:20,092
(His bold skills...)

27
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:21,964
(threaten Sauce Park's position.)

28
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:26,204
(Even Chef Yum acknowledges his cooking skills.)

29
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:27,543
(Hae Jin feels proud.)

30
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:29,644
(Generous Jung Ah makes whole halibut jeon.)

31
00:01:30,043 --> 00:01:31,674
(Nice and golden)

32
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:35,584
(Thanks to these two kings of cooking, )

33
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,814
(another hearty meal at the siblings' is ready.)

34
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:42,853
(The food tastes even tastier because they worked so hard.)

35
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:46,053
(They fully enjoyed the taste of Yeongdeok.)

36
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:47,293
(I'm done.)

37
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:50,933
(After filling their stomachs, they spend a relaxing second night.)

38
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:53,662
(The dinner in Yeongdeok, that felt even more bountiful...)

39
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,764
(because the five of them were together, comes to an end.)

40
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:59,132
(They all start cleaning up together.)

41
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,844
- Are you going to do the dishes?
- Yes.

42
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:04,413
What if I suddenly say, "No, I'm not going to do them."

43
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:05,743
(Kidding)

44
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:08,084
- Can you ask me one more time?
- What?

45
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:09,412
"Are you going to do the dishes?"

46
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:12,314
- Are you going to do the dishes?
- No. Thanks for doing that.

47
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:15,484
(They're so cute.)

48
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:18,454
(Dex is doing dishes by the outdoor faucet.)

49
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:21,963
(They're all busy with their own tasks.)

50
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:25,563
What should I clean?

51
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:27,364
(Hae Jin is looking for something to do.)

52
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:30,164
(Hae Jin comes to the kitchen to look for something to do.)

53
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:32,372
There are too many dishes for one person.

54
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:34,143
- Hae Jin. It's totally fine.
- There are too many.

55
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:38,044
If you let me do them slowly, I'd appreciate it.

56
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:41,084
- Okay.
- I can do it.

57
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:43,484
I'll take these...

58
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,213
(Hae Jin grabs a dirty bowl and spoon...)

59
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:49,984
(and gathers all of the leftovers to make the dishes easier.)

60
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:51,894
(Passing by)

61
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:56,622
You're so good at household chores, Hae Jin.

62
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:58,733
It has to be easy for the person doing the dishes.

63
00:02:58,734 --> 00:02:59,763
Right.

64
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:00,933
(Captain Yum gives Hae Jin the title, "Housekeeper Park.")

65
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:03,432
(Thoroughly cleaning the leftover food)

66
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,433
(That's done...)

67
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:07,373
(Housekeeper Park heads outside.)

68
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:10,444
(The next target is the table.)

69
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,473
(Taking just one paper towel)

70
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:16,743
(Picking up the crumbs on the table with one paper towel)

71
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:18,812
(Thoroughly)

72
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:21,153
(After it's all cleaned up...)

73
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:22,623
(Pulling out a tissue)

74
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,854
(He takes a wet tissue...)

75
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,324
(Wiping the table)

76
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:31,033
(Housekeeper Park is so thrifty.)

77
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:32,893
Gosh.

78
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:34,764
(Jung Ah likes this guest more and more.)

79
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,433
(Cleaning the stove)

80
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,903
(Wiping down the moisture on the sink)

81
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:42,574
(Clean)

82
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,514
Oh, my. Look at him clean up.

83
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:48,282
He was cleaning up.

84
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:51,252
Look at the footage. He's amazing.

85
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:52,553
(He's amazing!)

86
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:55,923
(Jung Ah showers him with praise.)

87
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:58,492
Gosh. These kids are even good at cleaning.

88
00:03:58,493 --> 00:03:59,523
(They're done cleaning up after dinner.)

89
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:01,363
I'm going to sit here because it's hot.

90
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:02,364
Yes.

91
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:05,463
Gosh. My back hurts today.

92
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:07,334
Your back hurts today?

93
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,833
I didn't even do much.

94
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,873
- What did I do today?
- Jumprope.

95
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,704
This one? Okay.

96
00:04:15,544 --> 00:04:17,544
(At the Halibut Sporting Day that was held this afternoon, )

97
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:20,574
(they could only do 3 successful jumps.)

98
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:23,313
(But Jung Ah, No-Rhythm Yum, did her best.)

99
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,283
The one where we jumped three times? Goodness.

100
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,353
I'm just a pathetic person.

101
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,354
(No-Rhythm Yum, Unwell)

102
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:32,924
That could happen if you hadn't used those muscles in a while.

103
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:35,794
I wasn't like that back in the day. I don't think.

104
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:38,893
There are so many weird bugs.

105
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:40,903
I think those are ants.

106
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:43,533
Gosh. Why are there so many bugs?

107
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:44,704
Because there's a light.

108
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:46,134
(But there are quite a lot.)

109
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:48,103
The flying ones.

110
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:52,014
(What can you do? You have to catch them.)

111
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:54,213
(They're going around the house catching bugs.)

112
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:55,613
There are so many.

113
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:58,712
I'll take care of them.

114
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:01,084
Do you think we can catch them with a lint roller on the ceiling?

115
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:03,583
These? These are...

116
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:05,423
(Jung Ah tries out Dex's idea right away.)

117
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:11,463
- I can't believe it's working.
- This is new.

118
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:14,162
(Exterminator Yum is here.)

119
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:15,304
This is so nice.

120
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,933
Can I roll it once over here?

121
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:18,934
Okay.

122
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,503
(Rolling)

123
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,003
This is a whole new world.

124
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:24,014
(This is a whole new world!)

125
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:25,272
This is so satisfying.

126
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:26,273
(So satisfying)

127
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:27,513
(Aim)

128
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:28,684
(Shoot)

129
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:30,884
(Dex catches the bugs.)

130
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:33,254
(Jung Ah wipes them up. They're the perfect duo.)

131
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,454
It's a massacre.

132
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:39,352
(Bugs are tough, but Exterminators Yum and Dex are tougher.)

133
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:40,353
Now get this one.

134
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:43,324
(Until the customer is satisfied, )

135
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:46,363
(Exterminators Yum and Dex will get rid of pests.)

136
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,602
(Going wild)

137
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:51,133
(Making robot sounds)

138
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:54,704
(Jung Ah is going along with Mischievous Dex.)

139
00:05:56,103 --> 00:05:59,014
(Upgrading his equipment)

140
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:02,084
(Insanity)

141
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,254
That's insane. You're a genius.

142
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:07,113
(Eyes opening wide)

143
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,223
(That's very impressive.)

144
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:11,624
(Proud)

145
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,592
(Dex, having lots of fun, vacuumed the bugs for a while...)

146
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:16,064
(before he called it a day.)

147
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,793
It's already the last night.

148
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:21,804
It's already the last night.

149
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:23,902
Good work today, everyone.

150
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:25,804
- Good work.
- Good work.

151
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:27,273
Should I make ramyeon?

152
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:30,744
Are you really going to eat Chapagetti, Jung Ah?

153
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:33,013
- He said he wanted some.
- How many do you want to eat?

154
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:34,043
- Make it.
- Make it.

155
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,684
Make it. Let's give it a taste.

156
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:38,352
He's cooking in front of the kings of cooking.

157
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:39,353
Let's see.

158
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,453
(Dex came to the kitchen to make jjajang ramyeon.)

159
00:06:40,454 --> 00:06:42,683
You're the kings of cooking.

160
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,324
(Meanwhile, the siblings were chatting.)

161
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:47,623
- Oh, my. What happened?
- Are you okay?

162
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:48,624
- Did something break?
- What happened?

163
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,134
(He was taking out a pot from the stack of cleaned dishes.)

164
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:54,363
(Clanking)

165
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:55,402
(Clanking)

166
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,472
- What happened?
- I'm okay, Hae Jin.

167
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:58,473
- What happened?
- I'm okay.

168
00:06:58,474 --> 00:06:59,972
- I'll help you.
- Just stay there, Hae Jin.

169
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:01,472
I took care of everything.

170
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:02,573
Gosh. Everyone is here.

171
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:04,573
It's okay.

172
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:05,712
Really.

173
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:06,772
You're okay, right?

174
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,584
I have this covered, so don't worry.

175
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:09,883
What was all of that?

176
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:11,152
(That's why I'm worried...)

177
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:12,982
People will think a war has broken out.

178
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,054
What was that?

179
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:17,023
- Are you okay, Dex?
- Yes.

180
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,023
(Will Dex successfully cook jjajang ramyeon without any issues?)

181
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:24,063
Did you have fun today, Hae Jin?

182
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:25,493
- Be honest.
- The day felt too short.

183
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:26,533
It felt short?

184
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:29,064
How do I put it?

185
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:31,533
Right as I think, "It's time to really have fun now," it ends.

186
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:33,873
Then when I go home, it's back to reality.

187
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:34,874
(Then when I go home, it's back to reality.)

188
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,373
- It kind of... Right.
- A totally different world.

189
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,043
- Totally.
- It's so funny.

190
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:40,944
It kind of...

191
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:42,782
(Eun Jin always feels sad on the last night.)

192
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,314
In your heart,

193
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,112
- you can say a few words...
- I'm going to miss you so much.

194
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,652
- Me too.
- You can do that.

195
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:48,684
Gosh.

196
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,593
On the day of our last shoot, are you going to cry...

197
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:52,922
and pat me on the back?

198
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:54,422
No. Don't cry. No.

199
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:56,693
Gosh. When will you come over to our side?

200
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:57,763
I won't.

201
00:07:57,764 --> 00:07:58,793
(While the siblings get sentimental on this summer night, )

202
00:07:58,994 --> 00:08:01,533
(Dex is cooking...)

203
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:05,033
(six packets of jjajang ramyeon in the kitchen.)

204
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:08,003
(Checking the noodles)

205
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:09,543
(The noodles passed the test.)

206
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:13,173
(Draining the water while showing off his forearms)

207
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:15,843
(Adding the seasoning powder he combined in a bowl earlier)

208
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:18,783
(Mix it!)

209
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,212
(After mixing it thoroughly...)

210
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:21,384
(Lips tightening from concentration)

211
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:22,923
(Olive oil)

212
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:26,423
(Mix it again.)

213
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:30,163
(The youngest mixes the noodles by using his forearm muscles.)

214
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:31,833
Okay.

215
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:32,962
Let's go.

216
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:33,993
(Your delivery is here.)

217
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:36,003
- Oh, my.
- Goodness!

218
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:38,303
- We're eating Dex's ramyeon.
- Thank you for the food.

219
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:40,472
- My goodness.
- Oh, my. That looks so good.

220
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:42,473
It's so nice and shiny.

221
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:43,743
(I need to take a picture of this.)

222
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:44,814
This is yours.

223
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,514
You kind of have to suck in the noodles like this.

224
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:49,613
Nice.

225
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:50,843
Thanks for the food.

226
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:52,512
How did you cook it so well?

227
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:53,783
The smell is insane.

228
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,284
You have to eat Chapagetti with coke.

229
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:57,323
- Really?
- Is it okay, Hae Jin?

230
00:08:57,324 --> 00:08:59,424
Really? That's good.

231
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,862
- It's so delicious!
- It's so delicious.

232
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:05,534
- You cooked it well.
- I put a lot of effort into it.

233
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:08,303
I'm so happy to see you all enjoying it so much.

234
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,403
Right? Doesn't it make you want to cook well?

235
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:11,502
- This is why people cook.
- You're good.

236
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:12,573
Exactly.

237
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:15,142
That's why you kept tasting things, I see.

238
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,304
(You wanted to eat tasty things.)

239
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,373
From now on, Dex can cook the ramyeon.

240
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:21,343
Dex makes the best ramyeon.

241
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:22,813
Ramyeon Kim.

242
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,883
- Ramyeon Kim. That's so fitting.
- You finally found your title

243
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:27,283
- Finally.
- It's so delicious.

244
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:29,023
Chapagetti made by Dex.

245
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:30,252
- Look at this.
- I'll give you more.

246
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,694
We have to hold our bowls. For the selfie.

247
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:34,794
Chapagetti that our youngest made.

248
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:36,824
That looks nice.

249
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:38,333
Thank you.

250
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:42,034
(Summer of 2024 in Yeongdeok, Dex's 1st dish was a big success.)

251
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:46,933
Sleep well, Hae Jin. Thank you for your help today.

252
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,073
Good work.

253
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:49,643
Goodnight.

254
00:09:56,983 --> 00:10:00,313
(When the birds stretch their wings...)

255
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:03,383
(and the sun peeks out over the ridge, )

256
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:08,093
(the rooster's healthy cry wakes up Inryang Village.)

257
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:13,633
(The elders of Inryang Village busily start their days, )

258
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:17,673
(but the kitties are not fully awake this early morning.)

259
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:18,774
(Blinking sleepily)

260
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:22,743
(Turning around)

261
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:24,613
(Smiling)

262
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:28,613
(As usual, Jung Ah woke up first again today.)

263
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:31,414
(She slowly starts getting ready.)

264
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,823
No. Sleep more.

265
00:10:35,824 --> 00:10:37,424
(So cute)

266
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,324
(She puts Jun Myun, who woke up from the noise, back to sleep.)

267
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:43,564
(Rolling over, flapping around)

268
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:46,434
(After a very short stretch, )

269
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:50,603
(she carefully leaves the room.)

270
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:54,204
(After changing, Jung Ah starts her morning cleaning session.)

271
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:58,074
(Sweeping the floor with a broom)

272
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:01,843
(Make the kitchen neat too)

273
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:05,084
(A productive and refreshing morning routine)

274
00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:08,154
(While she cleans, Housekeeper Park Hae Jin gets up.)

275
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:11,154
(Lying back down?)

276
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:16,064
(Our busy bees are so alike.)

277
00:11:18,363 --> 00:11:20,834
(Getting up)

278
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:26,574
(Following Jun Myun, Eun Jin gets up too.)

279
00:11:27,274 --> 00:11:28,674
- Dex.
- Yes?

280
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:30,603
- Do you want to get up now?
- Yes.

281
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,243
(The youngest gets up last with his big sister alarm.)

282
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,584
(Puffy faced)

283
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:41,684
(The effects of jjajang ramyeon last at night are impressive!)

284
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:45,753
(What kind of day will it be today in Yeongdeok?)

285
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:47,593
I'm ready.

286
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:48,824
Are you ready?

287
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:50,294
Come out, everyone.

288
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:52,592
Put your shoes on, everyone.

289
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:55,203
- It was so nice and cool.
- Seriously.

290
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:56,262
Let's do...

291
00:11:56,263 --> 00:11:57,263
- the National Physical Exercise.
- Okay.

292
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,044
(The National Physical Exercise?)

293
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:04,243
Okay. Let's stand in a circle.

294
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:06,774
- Please stand in a circle.
- The National Physical Exercise?

295
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:08,882
(Guests are no exceptions do the siblings' morning routine.)

296
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:09,943
Let's go.

297
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:11,914
Let's get started.

298
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:13,613
(Vocalizing)

299
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,723
Are you going to sing? Why are you warming up your throat?

300
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:18,122
(Cue the music.)

301
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:20,252
Please actively warm up your bodies.

302
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:22,294
(Are we really doing this?)

303
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:24,733
- I don't remember this.
- Just follow me.

304
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:28,002
(The National Physical Exercise starts with Jung Ah's lead.)

305
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:29,733
- My body feels different.
- Seriously.

306
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,073
I remember I really didn't want to do this.

307
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:34,174
Totally.

308
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,074
(By the look on his face, he clearly didn't like doing this.)

309
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,642
(They start with breathing first.)

310
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:40,113
Gosh.

311
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:41,913
(They're already groaning from the start as usual.)

312
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:42,943
(Groaning)

313
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,413
This is actually quite hard.

314
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:45,713
(Sighing)

315
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:47,553
This is the hardest part.

316
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:49,882
- Why do I remember this?
- Right?

317
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:51,623
Right? Your joints just move, right?

318
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:52,753
Let's go.

319
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:54,924
You even perfectly remember the standing up part.

320
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:58,493
(Even after a long time, his movements are perfect.)

321
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:00,534
(Messing up)

322
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:01,863
I forgot this part again.

323
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:04,733
(However, one person's movements aren't so perfect...)

324
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:06,373
(Messing up again)

325
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:09,444
(No-Rhythm Yum is starting to mess up.)

326
00:13:11,103 --> 00:13:12,174
Oh, this isn't the part.

327
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:14,313
Why? What were you going to do?

328
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:16,284
I was going to match your rhythm.

329
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:18,213
(Goodness)

330
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:20,613
This is it. This is the part.

331
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:22,784
Hae Jin. Watch Jung Ah for a second.

332
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:25,723
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

333
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:27,753
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

334
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:29,262
One, two, three...

335
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:30,392
(Only No-Rhythm Yum's feet are moving to a different beat.)

336
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,593
She really can't jump to the beat.

337
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:34,903
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

338
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:36,762
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

339
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:38,703
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

340
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:40,633
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

341
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:43,273
(A front-row seat at No-Rhythm Yum's show)

342
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:44,642
Will she succeed in the end?

343
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:46,142
I do this exercise because I want to see that.

344
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:47,174
Right.

345
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:49,113
Was the National Physical Exercise always so dynamic?

346
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:50,913
Let's go!

347
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,013
(The National Physical Exercise scene stealer, No-Rhythm Yum)

348
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:57,184
(After laughing so hard, they're almost nearing the end.)

349
00:13:58,123 --> 00:14:01,664
(His face is so puffy, but he's doing his best until the end.)

350
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:04,493
Gosh.

351
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:06,262
Goodness.

352
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,834
She did the ending correctly. What a surprise.

353
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:10,704
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

354
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:12,533
- That was pretty nice, right?
- I'm sweating.

355
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:13,834
- Yes, it makes you sweat.
- Why am I sweating after that?

356
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,342
- It's a nice exercise.
- Gosh.

357
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:16,804
(The guest is satisfied too.)

358
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:18,173
Go somewhere cool.

359
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:19,444
(Busy bee Jung Ah goes straight to the kitchen.)

360
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:21,444
I need to make rice.

361
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,814
(Laughing)

362
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,613
(She's about to start cooking breakfast right away.)

363
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:27,712
Jung Ah. I'm here.

364
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:28,784
- You came?
- Yes.

365
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:31,524
There's not much to do in terms of cooking now.

366
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:34,294
(The ingredient Jung Ah prepared for breakfast...)

367
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:37,064
(is canned tuna?)

368
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,493
Should we start at 6:30am?

369
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:41,263
There's not much to do for breakfast tomorrow.

370
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:43,304
We just need to add tuna and mix.

371
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:44,873
Tuna?

372
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:49,102
(The breakfast Jung Ah prepared for her younger siblings...)

373
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:51,814
(is tuna bibimbap.)

374
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,513
- We need to pick lettuce.
- Right.

375
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:56,213
- Can you pick some?
- Should we go?

376
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:58,153
Should we go together?

377
00:14:58,154 --> 00:14:59,483
(The Parks start moving right away at Chef Yum's orders.)

378
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:02,383
(While Chef Yum prepares the rice, )

379
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:03,852
(Sauce Parks head to the garden.)

380
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:04,853
Let's go.

381
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:07,054
Oh, this?

382
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:10,564
Where's the lettuce?

383
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:12,064
The lettuce is over there.

384
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:14,733
There isn't so much lettuce.

385
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:16,333
Did we eat it all yesterday?

386
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,564
(Laughing)

387
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:20,774
(The lettuce and perilla leaf area is obviously so empty...)

388
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:24,713
(After two days of these foodies eating...)

389
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:27,012
Oh, it's not...

390
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:29,084
(The lettuce is totally gone...)

391
00:15:29,314 --> 00:15:30,483
We'll need to pick it all.

392
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:32,583
(They try to harvest whatever is left...)

393
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:33,654
Right?

394
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:36,123
Let's see.

395
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:38,954
- Do I break it off like this?
- What?

396
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:41,462
- Am I not supposed to do that?
- Of course not, Jun Myun.

397
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:43,023
Then we can't eat it again.

398
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:45,593
(The lettuce)

399
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:46,933
(Oh, my...)

400
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,064
There's nothing we can do now.

401
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:49,733
It's all over.

402
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:52,102
- With lettuce...
- Should I only pick the leaves?

403
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,773
Yes. Just pick the leaves. This keeps growing.

404
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:54,803
(Oh, my...)

405
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:56,642
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

406
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,642
You just break off the whole head of lettuce?

407
00:15:58,643 --> 00:15:59,774
(The lettuce's bright future was pulled out at the root.)

408
00:16:00,314 --> 00:16:01,383
Can we plant it again?

409
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:03,444
Will it grow again if we plant it?

410
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:05,954
Let's try planting it again.

411
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:06,983
(Replanting the lettuce)

412
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,954
(Replanting the lettuce that was pulled out)

413
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:16,794
(Now, they're only picking the leaves.)

414
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:19,263
The lettuce is too small.

415
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:21,293
We won't be able to make wraps with this.

416
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:23,904
- We'll have to mix it in with rice.
- We'll have to do that.

417
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:27,133
(Stacking the leaves on a pretty wooden tray.)

418
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,473
This is totally enough for mixing in with rice.

419
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:34,643
(Clicking her tongue)

420
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:37,383
(After preparing the rice, Jung Ah has a dilemma...)

421
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:38,383
(Clicking her tongue again)

422
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,953
(Looking around the kitchen)

423
00:16:40,954 --> 00:16:42,784
(Looking around)

424
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,424
(Spontaneously picking a pot)

425
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:50,294
(Then she starts to prepare something)

426
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:55,064
(The Yeongdeok snow crab dashi stock from the first day)

427
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:56,803
(Yeongdeok snow crab dashi stock)

428
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,132
(Anchovies for making stock)

429
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,534
(Kelp)

430
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,774
(Starting with the stock)

431
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:04,444
Are you making soup too?

432
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,643
I'm going to make egg soup.

433
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:08,243
Egg soup? Oh, my!

434
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:09,983
- Insane.
- I love it.

435
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:12,554
- Do you like it? That's good.
- Yes.

436
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:15,954
(Chef Yum plans to make egg soup to go with the tuna bibimbap.)

437
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:20,294
(Jung Ah hums while making breakfast.)

438
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:24,964
(But there's a scary legend about this humming...)

439
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:29,393
(Jung Ah hums while making breakfast.)

440
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:33,534
(But there's a scary legend about this humming...)

441
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,534
(Humming)

442
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,004
(The more excited Jung Ah gets, the more food she makes...)

443
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:39,332
(Humming)

444
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,434
(The more excited Jung Ah gets, the more food she makes...)

445
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:43,303
(Adding a block of radish to the stock)

446
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:47,613
(And whole stocks of green onions too)

447
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:49,843
(Humming)

448
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,083
(With a large amount of radish and green onions...)

449
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:52,113
(Humming)

450
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,553
(She adds depth to the stock.)

451
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:57,553
(Generous Jung Ah heads to the refrigerator again.)

452
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:59,494
(Oh, nice!)

453
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:01,764
(She's excited at the thought of feeding her young siblings.)

454
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:05,063
(And a whole carton of eggs)

455
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:06,563
(Humming)

456
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:08,704
(Using 7 eggs and adding 1 more)

457
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:11,434
(Adding two more)

458
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:16,143
(For Generous Jung Ah, 10 eggs is the base.)

459
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,943
(A generous amount of ingredients are ready to go.)

460
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:21,244
(To keep the flavor of the soup while using so many eggs, )

461
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:24,543
(she adds some cooking wine first.)

462
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:26,214
(Careful)

463
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:29,784
(Minced garlic, snow crab soy sauce, anchovy sauce)

464
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:31,082
(Salt, black pepper)

465
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,254
(Seasoning the soup carefully)

466
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:40,194
(Now it's time to combine the eggs and the stock.)

467
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:45,833
(Adding some green onions to finish off)

468
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:47,873
(Jang Geum made...)

469
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:53,014
(egg soup in a snap.)

470
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:58,583
(It already looks tasty.)

471
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:02,524
(Meanwhile, Hae Jin, who is as productive as Jung Ah...)

472
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:05,823
(is checking on the space where they'll eat.)

473
00:19:06,153 --> 00:19:07,424
The bugs all died here.

474
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:09,024
(Grabbing a broom right away)

475
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,793
(Starting to sweep the floor right away)

476
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:19,103
(Very thorough)

477
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:22,974
(This reminds us...)

478
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:25,373
(We need to clean the arena thoroughly.)

479
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,643
(There's another Jung Ah...)

480
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:29,484
(Even Captain Yum was surprised...)

481
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:32,914
(at Captain Hwang?)

482
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:36,524
(He's exactly the same.)

483
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,694
There's so much sand. It's because of the wind.

484
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:43,264
(While he's at it, he even sweeps the sand by the front door.)

485
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:47,993
(Laughing)

486
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:49,132
- Why, Jung Ah?
- What?

487
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,734
- Why?
- He's my style.

488
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:52,133
(Right.)

489
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:57,204
He passed. Park Hae Jin passed.

490
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,173
- He's proactive and clean.
- He's very proactive and clean.

491
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,543
- He's clean.
- Gosh.

492
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:04,383
(Jung Ah really likes him.)

493
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:06,184
(Shoo?)

494
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:09,424
(Happy)

495
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:13,052
Do they only pick guests who are proactive and clean?

496
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:14,593
I guess those kinds of people come here.

497
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:17,062
That makes it harder for us grasshoppers.

498
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:19,133
(This grasshopper agrees.)

499
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:22,004
(He finished cleaning the floor where they'll eat.)

500
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:24,164
(Satisfied)

501
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:26,734
- Set the table.
- Bring out the table.

502
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,274
I see we moved...

503
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:29,674
the table over here.

504
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:31,543
Okay.

505
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:34,014
- Look at her. With one hand.
- Oh, yes.

506
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:35,313
Oh, my.

507
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:37,112
Okay.

508
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:38,414
(Leaving leisurely as if nothing happened)

509
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:42,083
(The young siblings work efficiently under Chef Yum's orders.)

510
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:45,293
- Dex. Can you take these?
- Okay.

511
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:47,694
Oh, my. Amazing.

512
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:49,592
This is amazing.

513
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:50,863
(Thanks to them, breakfast is getting ready quickly.)

514
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:54,633
(Meanwhile, Chef Yum checks on the rice.)

515
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:58,833
(Adding the freshly-cooked rice to a bowl good for mixing)

516
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:02,004
(Like the generous person she is, she adds a lot of rice.)

517
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:06,774
(Adding lots of lettuce that her younger siblings picked)

518
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:09,143
(Breakfast is ready.)

519
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:11,082
(Generous Jung Ah's mixing show will begin now.)

520
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,083
Oh, gosh.

521
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,784
(Audience member 1)

522
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:17,184
(Audience member 2)

523
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:19,353
(The audience is waiting.)

524
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:22,224
You can mix this...

525
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:23,724
without adding anything else.

526
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:24,724
I see.

527
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:27,764
- There's sesame oil inside, right?
- Yes, it has sesame oil.

528
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:29,303
That must be tasty.

529
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:31,903
(Fascinated)

530
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:34,474
Look at this. We put it in the rice, right?

531
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:36,303
We added the tuna, right? And then,

532
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:38,944
vegetables. Pour them in.

533
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,643
Mix it. You don't need other sauces.

534
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:44,143
Oh, just like that?

535
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:47,454
- Because the tuna itself is good.
- Right. It's already flavored.

536
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:49,383
Things like that are convenient for when you're going somewhere.

537
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:51,254
You don't need to bring sesame oil separately.

538
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,652
You just need to take that...

539
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:54,123
- and mix it with rice.
- Just in rice.

540
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:56,093
- The smell is insane.
- Oh, my.

541
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:58,092
- The smell is amazing.
- Look at this smell.

542
00:21:58,093 --> 00:22:00,093
Oh, my. This looks so tasty.

543
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,964
- This looks so tasty.
- This looks so good.

544
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:03,863
Look at this.

545
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:04,964
(We have another Photographer Park.)

546
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:06,203
That looks so good.

547
00:22:06,204 --> 00:22:07,234
- I'm curious.
- This is amazing.

548
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,643
(Another appetizing breakfast)

549
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:16,514
(This tuna bibimbap makes everyone salivate.)

550
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:22,623
(There's also Jung Ah's egg soup to go with the tuna bibimbap.)

551
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:29,363
(A simple but hearty breakfast is ready.)

552
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:33,593
- Can we eat, Captain?
- Yes. Let's eat!

553
00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:35,764
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

554
00:22:37,164 --> 00:22:38,204
I'm curious.

555
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:39,974
The smell...

556
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,003
is seriously no joke.

557
00:22:42,004 --> 00:22:43,474
(First, some very savory-smelling tuna bibimbap.)

558
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:48,273
Can you smell the sesame oil? It's in the air.

559
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:50,014
I can smell the sesame oil.

560
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:51,843
(Hae Jin smells it first.)

561
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,184
- Oh, my.
- Let's eat.

562
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,714
The smell really is different.

563
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:57,553
(Taking a bite of the bibimbap while smelling the savory scent)

564
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:58,793
Oh, my!

565
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:02,893
(The cooking process is simple, but the flavor is satisfying.)

566
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:04,863
- I just mixed this.
- You just added it to rice, right?

567
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,333
(Mischievous Dex loves it too.)

568
00:23:12,774 --> 00:23:14,774
(Satisfied)

569
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:16,774
- Everyone likes the tuna.
- Yes.

570
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:20,444
This is so convenient when you don't have side dishes.

571
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:21,613
- Yes.
- It's delicious.

572
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:25,414
When did you come up with the idea to make the soup?

573
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:26,984
We need something to wash everything down.

574
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:29,454
Yes. The egg soup is tasty.

575
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,224
(Taking a big bite of the bibimbap)

576
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:36,863
(Having some egg soup when she's craving broth)

577
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:41,994
(The egg soup is perfect for when the bibimbap feels dry.)

578
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:43,903
Yes!

579
00:23:44,234 --> 00:23:46,373
(After a bite of the bibimbap, )

580
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:50,843
(everyone wants to drink the soup straight from the bowl.)

581
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:53,014
(Egg soup)

582
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:54,613
(Egg soup)

583
00:23:55,043 --> 00:23:56,444
(She's happy to see everyone enjoying the food.)

584
00:23:56,543 --> 00:23:57,583
The menu is so good.

585
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:00,612
I made this soup the most often...

586
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:01,754
- when I lived alone.
- Right?

587
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:03,424
Egg soup?

588
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,883
Yes. It's the easiest to make.

589
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:07,694
Hae Jin is kind of similar to me in that way.

590
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:10,323
I think we have similar food portions and preferences.

591
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:12,234
- I saw that you ate a lot.
- I'm no joke.

592
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,164
- He eats well.
- I need at least two packs...

593
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:15,603
of Chapagetti.

594
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,034
You have to start at three packs for Chapagetti.

595
00:24:17,563 --> 00:24:19,774
That's what Jun Myun said yesterday.

596
00:24:19,873 --> 00:24:20,873
(Scraping the bowl clean)

597
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:22,873
(Taking a bite)

598
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:24,704
(Not leaving a single grain of rice in the bowl)

599
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:27,073
Gosh. I'm full, but I keep eating so much.

600
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,484
(I'm full, but it's okay.)

601
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:33,183
(As usual, the four siblings eat well today.)

602
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:34,213
It's so good.

603
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:35,684
It's not even too oily.

604
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:38,793
(Pulling in the lettuce)

605
00:24:40,393 --> 00:24:43,063
I'm going to eat the rest in here.

606
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:45,733
(Eating every last bit of food)

607
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,734
It's so good.

608
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,504
I ate again. Gosh.

609
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:51,103
(The breakfast was simple, but they enjoyed it a lot.)

610
00:24:51,764 --> 00:24:53,474
Do you want to check out the village with Hae Jin?

611
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:55,174
Shall we?

612
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:56,744
- Do you ride bikes?
- Yes.

613
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,774
We only have two bikes.

614
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:01,373
You four can go.

615
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:03,684
I'll do the dishes.

616
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:06,153
I don't want to be apart from you.

617
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,254
Oh, gosh. You're being clingy.

618
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:10,053
It'll be quick. About ten minutes?

619
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:11,852
(Cute)

620
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:12,994
Let's just walk around a bit.

621
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:16,323
I can go with Dex riding in the back.

622
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:19,534
It's "With Dex riding in the back" and not "I'll ride in the back?"

623
00:25:20,534 --> 00:25:22,764
(The youngest is used to it.)

624
00:25:23,204 --> 00:25:24,234
Because I'm older.

625
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:25,434
(Laughing)

626
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,773
Then I'll ride in the back of Hae Jin's bike...

627
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:29,204
and do a lap around the village.

628
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:31,173
Should we put all of the broth in here?

629
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:32,174
(Cleaning up together for Jun Myun who'll do the dishes)

630
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:33,274
Be careful.

631
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:34,914
Throwing away the leftovers.

632
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:37,583
- Just put them over there.
- Okay.

633
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:39,653
So I can do the dishes.

634
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,184
- You're doing all the work alone.
- Not at all, Jung Ah.

635
00:25:45,623 --> 00:25:48,353
I didn't help cook, so I'll do the dishes.

636
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:53,393
(While Jun Myun does the dishes, )

637
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:58,934
(Jung Ah grabs something from the fridge.)

638
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:01,803
(She is the first to come out...)

639
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:06,543
(and put cold water on the bicycles.)

640
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:08,043
(Proud)

641
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:09,342
Shall we?

642
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:11,414
Have fun. I won't go out to send you off.

643
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:15,414
Let's ride it out there because it's dirt around here.

644
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,023
Dex, you'll run. Okay?

645
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:18,822
- I don't want to run.
- You have to run.

646
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:19,893
I won't go, then.

647
00:26:20,353 --> 00:26:21,392
You need a workout.

648
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:22,393
(Teasing)

649
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:23,993
I've come only because you said you'd give me a ride.

650
00:26:23,994 --> 00:26:25,123
Okay. I will.

651
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,664
This is an uphill, though.

652
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:29,664
- Yes. Give me a ride.
- Hey.

653
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:31,464
- You ride the bike.
- Will I be able to do it?

654
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,132
- Go ahead.
- Can I go uphill?

655
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,133
(With someone in the backseat, )

656
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:37,273
- Of course.
- Can you?

657
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:38,474
(do I go up this hill?)

658
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:44,813
(And it's quite long too.)

659
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:46,853
If you go first, I'll follow you.

660
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:48,153
Gosh.

661
00:26:48,553 --> 00:26:49,923
- Will I be able to do it?
- Goodness.

662
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:50,924
- Wait a second.
- I can...

663
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:54,622
- I can do it.
- Goodness.

664
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:55,623
It's uphill.

665
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:56,693
- Hold on.
- No.

666
00:26:56,694 --> 00:26:59,092
- The bicycle is too small.
- Is it too small for you?

667
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:00,333
I'll try again, Jung Ah.

668
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:02,664
Get off.

669
00:27:03,504 --> 00:27:05,602
- For goodness' sake.
- I'll see if you can do it.

670
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:06,832
You're so weak.

671
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,274
(They're changing the driver in the end.)

672
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:10,703
See how it's done, okay?

673
00:27:10,704 --> 00:27:11,704
(Pinching)

674
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:16,813
(After getting scolded, he starts to ride the bike.)

675
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:19,883
Nice, the Underdog Task Force.

676
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,913
Underdog Task Force, let's go.

677
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:23,553
- You're good.
- Of course.

678
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:26,352
(Jung Ah and Hae Jin who left first)

679
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,953
- Jung Ah.
- Goodness.

680
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:29,024
- Jung Ah.
- Gosh.

681
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,164
- The handle is acting weird.
- Why?

682
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:33,664
Let's not ride it on the uphill.

683
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:38,763
They have a beautiful garden.

684
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:39,833
I know.

685
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:41,833
Hello.

686
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:44,204
(Jung Ah bows too.)

687
00:27:44,444 --> 00:27:46,073
Good morning.

688
00:27:46,444 --> 00:27:47,974
- Hello.
- Hello.

689
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:52,083
Look. It's lovely. It's a protected tree.

690
00:27:53,684 --> 00:27:57,123
(They found a protected tree in the middle of Inryang Village.)

691
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:58,723
It has been growing for 350 years.

692
00:27:58,724 --> 00:27:59,924
- Really?
- Yes.

693
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:01,954
- It's really gorgeous.
- Yes.

694
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:03,893
It's so marvelous.

695
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:08,633
(The tree that has settled down in Inryang Village for a long time)

696
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:14,603
(Like the long history it embraces, the branches stretch far.)

697
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:21,174
(They'll take a short break under the protected tree.)

698
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:25,484
- They ride it fine without us.
- I know.

699
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:32,224
(Hae Jin and Dex will ride around the Village on the bikes.)

700
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,092
- Hello.
- Hello.

701
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:38,293
(They exchange warm greetings with the village person.)

702
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:39,593
It's cool.

703
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:41,893
I love it.

704
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:47,274
(Hae Jin and Dex ride through the cool breeze.)

705
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:49,073
This village is so pretty.

706
00:28:49,903 --> 00:28:51,704
- It's really serene.
- Yes.

707
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:54,943
- This house is really...
- There are many traditional houses.

708
00:28:54,944 --> 00:28:56,244
I know. They look great.

709
00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:59,014
(They take in the village's scenery at once on the bikes.)

710
00:29:00,714 --> 00:29:03,123
(From the quiet old houses...)

711
00:29:04,754 --> 00:29:07,924
(to the wildflowers on the streets, Inryang Village is like a painting.)

712
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:12,194
(Hae Jin and Dex enjoy their free time.)

713
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:15,363
Gosh. This calls for a match.

714
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:17,704
Professional player Yum.

715
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,704
How have you been?

716
00:29:20,803 --> 00:29:22,573
(Nodding)

717
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:25,774
Jung Ah, you never respond to my bit.

718
00:29:26,313 --> 00:29:27,642
I'm responding to it right now.

719
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,244
Really? Pro Yum.

720
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:31,444
It's me not wanting to speak with you.

721
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:33,484
I heard masters don't talk much.

722
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:35,184
(Laughing)

723
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:36,184
(They burst into laughter.)

724
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:38,224
Okay. Gosh. It feels nice.

725
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:40,322
I love it.

726
00:29:40,323 --> 00:29:41,424
(It's really cool in the shade.)

727
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:43,292
(Hae Jin and Dex join them.)

728
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:44,664
- Gosh.
- Yes.

729
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:46,093
- Do you like it?
- Pro Player Kim.

730
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:50,402
She sat here to play Omok.

731
00:29:50,403 --> 00:29:53,573
Do you want a match in front of the tree...

732
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,103
- that's 350 years old?
- Sure.

733
00:29:56,903 --> 00:29:58,803
Okay. Pro Player Park.

734
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:01,444
- Play Omok.
- It's here.

735
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:02,944
- Nice.
- The Omok set is here.

736
00:30:03,643 --> 00:30:04,744
- Jun Myun.
- Yes.

737
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:06,813
Come. It's nice and cool here.

738
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:09,123
- What is this place? It's pretty.
- Isn't it lovely?

739
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:11,254
- Let's play...
- Pro Player Park.

740
00:30:11,754 --> 00:30:13,194
(Laughing)

741
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,763
Who will play against Player Park?

742
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:16,764
- Player Kim?
- It's hot.

743
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:19,164
- I'll go first.
- Yes. Play against Player Park.

744
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,363
I'll follow the basic strategy.

745
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:24,464
I will block every path of the opponent.

746
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,233
(Thinking)

747
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:30,102
Gosh, Player Park. He's not an easy match.

748
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:32,673
(Player Park attacks proactively.)

749
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:35,014
- He's a difficult match.
- Hold on.

750
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:36,943
(Glancing)

751
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,813
It's a one-sided game already.

752
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,013
It's a one-sided game.

753
00:30:41,014 --> 00:30:42,783
- It's been...
- He's really good.

754
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:44,284
(The game is over.)

755
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:46,123
What? You put it there?

756
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:47,994
I lost.

757
00:30:49,694 --> 00:30:51,993
- Okay. Player Ahn.
- Okay.

758
00:30:51,994 --> 00:30:53,333
Has it been one minute since we started?

759
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,903
I'm going to beat Player Park.

760
00:30:56,303 --> 00:30:59,373
When you play Omok, you can't be passive.

761
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:03,142
Player Ahn, can't you see that spot? My goodness.

762
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:05,542
- There's nothing.
- You're right.

763
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:07,244
You'll go that way, right?

764
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:09,543
My goodness.

765
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:13,014
(She attacks, undisturbed by the youngest's interruption.)

766
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:15,612
My future seems bleak.

767
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,853
Gosh. Where should I put it?

768
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:19,053
Where?

769
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:23,224
(Attacking with a song)

770
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:25,862
Hae Jin.

771
00:31:25,863 --> 00:31:28,833
(Eun Jin won.)

772
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:30,233
(Lost)

773
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:32,872
- You fell for her trick.
- I'll leave now.

774
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:34,703
Hae Jin, let's wrap it up now.

775
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:35,872
- It was a nice match.
- No one can beat her.

776
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:38,704
Player Park, it was a great match.

777
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:40,513
I hope to see you again.

778
00:31:40,514 --> 00:31:42,342
She's a world champion of miscellaneous tricks.

779
00:31:42,343 --> 00:31:43,343
I enjoyed it.

780
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:47,514
(Under the protected tree in Yeongdeok's Inryang Village)

781
00:31:47,754 --> 00:31:49,183
- Did you pack everything?
- Yes.

782
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:51,984
He's such a neat person. As for the packing,

783
00:31:52,754 --> 00:31:54,592
he organized his suitcase whenever he took something out.

784
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:56,123
(Sadly, it's time to say goodbye.)

785
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:58,123
Give it to me. I'll take it out.

786
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,893
Gosh. Thank you.

787
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:02,833
Dex, give this to Hae Jin.

788
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:05,033
Okay. We'll put it up there and hold it down.

789
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:06,034
Okay.

790
00:32:06,035 --> 00:32:07,474
(They give the peaches they harvested to Hae Jin.)

791
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:09,902
(It's hard to leave.)

792
00:32:09,903 --> 00:32:10,903
It's sad.

793
00:32:11,303 --> 00:32:12,473
- Is it?
- Yes.

794
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:15,113
Okay. One, two, three.

795
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:17,142
One, two, three.

796
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,214
(He makes the last piece of memory with the siblings.)

797
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:20,783
(At Yeongdeok's Inryang Village in the summer of 2024)

798
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:22,153
- Thank you.
- Yes.

799
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:24,253
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

800
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:25,653
- I loved it.
- He's leaving.

801
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:27,592
- I'm so glad he liked it.
- Yes.

802
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:28,754
- I loved it.
- Seriously.

803
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:37,102
It feels like I was here for just half a day...

804
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:38,163
- Really?
- when I even slept over.

805
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,204
- It went that fast?
- Yes.

806
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:41,373
Somehow, I don't want to go to Seoul.

807
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:42,974
(Nodding)

808
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:45,573
(Filled with sadness)

809
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:47,812
- Well done.
- I was happy to see you.

810
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:49,173
- You were great.
- When we meet again...

811
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:50,914
(They say goodbye.)

812
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:54,714
(Jung Ah is grateful to Hae Jin for coming this far.)

813
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:56,383
Bye, Jung Ah.

814
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:58,552
Bye. See you in Seoul.

815
00:32:58,553 --> 00:32:59,954
Okay. See you in Seoul.

816
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:01,893
Bye.

817
00:33:02,424 --> 00:33:04,062
(The second guest, Hae Jin, leaves.)

818
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:06,093
Bye, Hae Jin.

819
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:09,464
- Bye.
- Bye.

820
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:18,043
(The siblings head back home.)

821
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:21,914
(After Hae Jin left, )

822
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:25,744
(the four siblings have their last moment in Yeongdeok.)

823
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:27,453
We'll make the peach jam now.

824
00:33:27,454 --> 00:33:29,553
Yes. We have to make the peach jam.

825
00:33:30,323 --> 00:33:32,422
(They delivered the peaches of Yeongdeok on their first day.)

826
00:33:32,423 --> 00:33:35,153
Yeongdeok's peaches are the best.

827
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:39,063
(They've decided to keep the taste of the season for a long time...)

828
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,133
(by making the peaches into jam.)

829
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:44,164
(First, wash the peaches thoroughly.)

830
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:47,374
(They have a basket of peaches to make the jam.)

831
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:49,172
- Here...
- Do we have to peel them?

832
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:50,273
Yes. We'll peel them.

833
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:54,044
(Peach-making tip: Peel the skin for a softer texture.)

834
00:33:54,914 --> 00:33:56,643
I can't believe I'm making a peach jam.

835
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:58,113
(Chop each of them finely.)

836
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,914
(Doing her best)

837
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:03,753
We can chop them into large pieces to feel the chunks.

838
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:06,153
I think it'll be tasty because the peaches are sweet.

839
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,023
- How fragrant will it be?
- Exactly.

840
00:34:09,664 --> 00:34:12,494
(Looking at the peeled peach)

841
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:15,164
(Glancing)

842
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:18,664
(Putting a piece into her mouth)

843
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:20,834
It's sweet.

844
00:34:21,403 --> 00:34:23,443
- They are definitely tasty, right?
- Yes.

845
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,172
(No need to say more.)

846
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:26,173
It's so sweet.

847
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:27,913
I've been eating more peaches than I can ask for.

848
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:29,243
Yes. More than we can ask for.

849
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:31,744
(She nimbly has another piece since they are tasty.)

850
00:34:31,943 --> 00:34:34,553
(Jun Myun enjoys them.)

851
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:37,784
We are done.

852
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,994
(It's filled with peach and nectarine.)

853
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:44,994
(Adding sugar)

854
00:34:45,423 --> 00:34:48,494
(Giving it a good stir to mix thoroughly)

855
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:53,834
(It's time to boil the peaches slowly over the low heat.)

856
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:56,974
I just need to sit and stir it.

857
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:00,772
(The key is to keep stirring...)

858
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:03,244
(so that it won't stick to the bottom of the pan.)

859
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:09,584
(Stir it for a long time until it gets thick.)

860
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:13,423
(What are Eun Jin and Dex doing while they are making jam?)

861
00:35:13,593 --> 00:35:15,092
We go in the water like this, right?

862
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:16,962
Yes. We'll go like this.

863
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:18,193
(Are they going to swim again?)

864
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:22,132
This area is known for...

865
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:24,163
something called Venus clams.

866
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,533
- "Venus clams." - I've never heard of it.

867
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:27,303
We can harvest them.

868
00:35:27,604 --> 00:35:29,034
- That sounds fun.
- Do we do it?

869
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:31,943
We have a chance to pocket some money.

870
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:36,612
Each Venus clam is worth 40 cents.

871
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:38,482
- What?
- Venus clams.

872
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:39,684
- "Venus clams?" - Yes.

873
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:40,953
It's 40 cents each?

874
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:42,854
Yes. Apparently, there are lying around everywhere.

875
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,883
So, we'll keep it a secret and pocket the money.

876
00:35:45,983 --> 00:35:47,994
If you want to go out on a date with me, just say so.

877
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:51,922
(Boiling with anger)

878
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:54,132
If you say that you're dying to go out on a date,

879
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,463
I'll think about it.

880
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:58,003
What is wrong with your personality?

881
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:01,104
(He loves to tease Eun Jin.)

882
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:03,973
Have a sip and let's go.

883
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:05,104
- Go?
- Yes.

884
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:07,013
It'll be a secret fund.

885
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:08,573
(Eun Jin, the instigator)

886
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:10,212
"Secret fund."

887
00:36:10,213 --> 00:36:12,983
(Dex, the henchman)

888
00:36:13,414 --> 00:36:14,982
Do you want to be a business partner?

889
00:36:14,983 --> 00:36:16,553
(The younger ones' plan to make a secret fund)

890
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:17,784
What is it?

891
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:18,922
(What are the two doing?)

892
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:20,193
If we harvest clams, they'll give us...

893
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,093
- They'll give us 10 cents.
- 5 cents.

894
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:24,263
Say 10 cents. They'll pay us 10 cents.

895
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:27,362
So, if we harvest them, we can make money.

896
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:28,833
(Her mouth is parched.)

897
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,233
How great would it be?

898
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:33,273
It'll be good for us. They are the Venus clams.

899
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:36,343
You have to harvest clams to earn ten cents?

900
00:36:37,544 --> 00:36:39,403
It's ten cents each.

901
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:43,213
The two of us will go and make some money by harvesting clams.

902
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:44,982
- Right now?
- Yes.

903
00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:46,454
(Awkward)

904
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:49,084
(Eun Jin, you can say it better than that.)

905
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:51,584
Goodness. Go ahead.

906
00:36:51,724 --> 00:36:54,423
- We want to make some money.
- Okay. Go ahead.

907
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:56,163
Let's hurry, Dex.

908
00:36:56,164 --> 00:36:57,164
(They successfully deceive naive older sisters.)

909
00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:58,394
We can go like this.

910
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:01,664
Should I seal my foot?

911
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,803
It won't work, will it?

912
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,173
(Is Eun Jin putting a glove on her foot?)

913
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,173
(I scraped my foot.)

914
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:12,303
(Eun Jin hurt her foot during the sports day yesterday.)

915
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:14,612
How will you go in the water with that foot?

916
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:15,974
I'm going to seal it completely.

917
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:19,144
You have to wear socks, Eun Jin.

918
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:20,653
I will.

919
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:24,923
(Sealing it twice with the glove)

920
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:27,093
What do you think of my foot?

921
00:37:28,523 --> 00:37:29,994
Oh, dear.

922
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,423
It's water-resistant.

923
00:37:31,494 --> 00:37:34,063
I see. That's a good idea.

924
00:37:34,064 --> 00:37:36,204
Did you think I was just trying to be funny?

925
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:38,203
- I thought so.
- I'm not...

926
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:40,502
I'm not that courageous to do so.

927
00:37:40,503 --> 00:37:41,534
Poor thing.

928
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:44,203
Okay.

929
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:45,873
(Should we go and make some secret fund?)

930
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:46,874
Good.

931
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:48,143
We'll get going.

932
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:49,543
- Bye.
- Bye.

933
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:51,683
- We'll make lots of money.
- Okay.

934
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:53,583
Don't try too hard to make lots of money.

935
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:55,183
- I see.
- It's ten cents each.

936
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:57,052
It's ten cents each.

937
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:58,482
It's not much.

938
00:37:58,483 --> 00:38:00,454
- Gosh.
- Bye.

939
00:38:00,994 --> 00:38:02,093
Bye.

940
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:03,963
- We'll get going.
- Okay.

941
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:10,664
(After driving in hopes for the secret fund, )

942
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:14,974
(they reach the beach 10-minute away from the house.)

943
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:20,273
(A sand beach stretches far along the ocean.)

944
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:23,644
(In the sand...)

945
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:28,314
(are Yeongdeok's another treasure, Venus clams.)

946
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:32,684
(In the wide sand patch near the shallow sea, )

947
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:37,593
(you can find Venus clams.)

948
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:39,993
(Venus clams: They inhabit in the sand...)

949
00:38:39,994 --> 00:38:41,833
(beneath the shallow water of the East Coast.)

950
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,663
(They're as big as the Manila clams but have a bright, fancy pattern...)

951
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:44,704
(with a rich flavor.)

952
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,133
I love it.

953
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,604
- It's 40 cents a clam.
- Yes.

954
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:51,103
- So...
- Forty cents.

955
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:54,543
We should pocket at least 5 or 6 dollars.

956
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:55,942
Right. Do the math.

957
00:38:55,943 --> 00:38:58,413
We can give them five dollars.

958
00:38:58,414 --> 00:39:01,413
- Yes.
- And we'll have five dollars each.

959
00:39:01,414 --> 00:39:03,183
Let's be greedy and pocket ten dollars...

960
00:39:03,184 --> 00:39:04,583
since we are young and healthy.

961
00:39:04,584 --> 00:39:06,353
- Let's go.
- We'll exterminate the clams.

962
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:09,664
I know. I'll apologize to the beach in advance.

963
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,393
- Gosh.
- Goodness. There will be...

964
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:13,533
no clams on the beach from now on.

965
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:14,764
(What will happen to the Venus clams?)

966
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:16,362
- Dex, come here.
- What?

967
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:18,132
- Why?
- This way. Let me see.

968
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:19,164
Put the sunscreen on your face for the last time.

969
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:20,503
What? Where?

970
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:22,302
- Close your eyes.
- No. It hurts my eyes.

971
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:24,442
It won't. It's a mild one.

972
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:25,443
Do it.

973
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:27,173
- I'll spray on your neck too.
- Okay.

974
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:29,314
(Shooting)

975
00:39:29,573 --> 00:39:30,644
Turn around.

976
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:32,342
The back of your neck. Look down.

977
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:33,353
(She thoroughly sprays it on the back of his neck too.)

978
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:34,652
- Good.
- My arms.

979
00:39:34,653 --> 00:39:35,713
Okay.

980
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:38,153
- My feet.
- Okay.

981
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:40,994
(The youngest has lots of requests.)

982
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:42,793
Turn around.

983
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:43,822
(Spraying thoroughly, 360-degree around)

984
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:45,022
(After spraying it on the younger brother)

985
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,093
Good job.

986
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:47,764
(Spraying it on herself)

987
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,433
Are you washing up?

988
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:53,073
(Washing up with the sunscreen)

989
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,302
We might be late.

990
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:57,173
(After blocking the UV rays, it's time to block the seawater.)

991
00:39:57,474 --> 00:39:58,743
Let's make money.

992
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:00,513
I'll take care of it. Okay?

993
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:03,014
- It'll be fun, right?
- Yes. I love the ocean.

994
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:06,044
(On the beach today...)

995
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:08,854
Many people are playing in the sea.

996
00:40:08,954 --> 00:40:10,684
- What? That's true.
- Right?

997
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:16,323
(People are playing in the sea in small groups.)

998
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:19,063
(Eun Jin and Dex go to dig up some clams.)

999
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:20,934
(They harvested them with the fishing co-op's permission.)

1000
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:24,604
- The waves are quite big.
- I know.

1001
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:26,402
Can we harvest clams today?

1002
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:27,902
(Can we harvest clams today?)

1003
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:32,073
(The waves are bigger than the first day.)

1004
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:33,644
Can we do this?

1005
00:40:34,914 --> 00:40:35,974
Can you even see?

1006
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:39,413
(With the big waves and cloudy weather, )

1007
00:40:39,414 --> 00:40:40,483
(the water isn't that clear.)

1008
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:44,553
(They walk into the sea.)

1009
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:49,224
(The two siblings fight the waves.)

1010
00:40:49,624 --> 00:40:50,962
(Carefully)

1011
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:52,423
- Dex.
- We can try it here.

1012
00:40:55,274 --> 00:40:58,075
(The two siblings fight the waves.)

1013
00:40:58,374 --> 00:40:59,813
(Carefully)

1014
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:01,345
- Dex.
- We can try it here.

1015
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:05,515
The wave's coming.

1016
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:08,925
(Hurray.)

1017
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,624
(They try looking in the water.)

1018
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:15,164
Oh, dear. Can you see anything from here?

1019
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:16,864
No. I don't think there are clams here.

1020
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:17,865
(No. I don't think there are clams...)

1021
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,635
(Attacked out of the blue)

1022
00:41:23,374 --> 00:41:25,405
(Retreating)

1023
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,945
(Someone help Mischievous Dex.)

1024
00:41:29,604 --> 00:41:33,144
(The overalls are useless because of the choppy waves.)

1025
00:41:33,414 --> 00:41:37,115
(Is it this hard to make the secret fund?)

1026
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:39,285
The water is in my overalls already.

1027
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:41,824
Gosh. It's crazy.

1028
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:42,954
(They give up the overalls.)

1029
00:41:43,354 --> 00:41:45,453
(Crying)

1030
00:41:45,454 --> 00:41:47,024
Gosh. What is this?

1031
00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:49,064
Aren't they cold?

1032
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:54,504
(They play joyfully in the sea.)

1033
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:57,704
Hey. It's so hard to make money.

1034
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,905
It's coming. Yes.

1035
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:04,814
(It's the same sea, but it feels different.)

1036
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:07,714
(The secret fund is at stake.)

1037
00:42:07,715 --> 00:42:09,144
Gosh. It's cold.

1038
00:42:10,684 --> 00:42:13,854
(The UDT soldier doesn't back down like this.)

1039
00:42:14,055 --> 00:42:17,925
(The youngest walks into the water without hesitation.)

1040
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:20,794
(Diving)

1041
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,595
My goodness.

1042
00:42:23,995 --> 00:42:26,035
(Screaming)

1043
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:28,834
You are brave.

1044
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:33,844
(To find the clams, )

1045
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:35,043
(he bows at a 90-degree angle.)

1046
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:36,745
(Screaming)

1047
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,074
(The 90-degree bow)

1048
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,174
(Screaming)

1049
00:42:39,175 --> 00:42:40,183
(The 90-degree bow)

1050
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:41,785
(Screaming)

1051
00:42:42,445 --> 00:42:45,854
(It's not easy to find the Venus clams.)

1052
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:49,853
- There aren't any clams.
- No?

1053
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:52,224
- There aren't any clams.
- Oh, no.

1054
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:54,494
- There have to be clams.
- There aren't any.

1055
00:42:54,495 --> 00:42:56,064
What should we do?

1056
00:42:58,635 --> 00:43:00,834
(Eun Jin also bows at a 90-degree angle.)

1057
00:43:01,104 --> 00:43:03,035
(Super focused)

1058
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:06,905
(Bowing at a 90-degree angle together)

1059
00:43:08,704 --> 00:43:09,873
(Did she finally harvest the first one?)

1060
00:43:09,874 --> 00:43:11,445
It's an empty shell.

1061
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:16,143
(Will they be able to make the secret fund?)

1062
00:43:16,144 --> 00:43:17,414
No. I can do it.

1063
00:43:19,854 --> 00:43:22,453
(While the younger ones are struggling, )

1064
00:43:22,454 --> 00:43:24,055
(the older sisters are...)

1065
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:29,724
(The peach jam is boiling down slowly.)

1066
00:43:30,135 --> 00:43:32,164
(Let me see.)

1067
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:37,035
(Why did she take out another burner?)

1068
00:43:37,204 --> 00:43:39,504
- I'll make kalguksu.
- "Kalguksu?" Nice.

1069
00:43:40,305 --> 00:43:42,143
(Thinking that the younger ones would get many clams, )

1070
00:43:42,144 --> 00:43:43,944
(she decides to make kalguksu with the Venus clams for lunch.)

1071
00:43:43,945 --> 00:43:46,684
(But depending on the situation, there may not be any clams in it.)

1072
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:50,014
Should I make the broth in advance?

1073
00:43:50,015 --> 00:43:51,155
(Should I make the broth in advance?)

1074
00:43:52,285 --> 00:43:53,354
Gosh.

1075
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:55,285
But I have to stir this.

1076
00:43:56,124 --> 00:43:57,154
I have to stir the jam.

1077
00:43:57,155 --> 00:43:58,523
(But she can't take her eyes off the jam.)

1078
00:43:58,524 --> 00:43:59,524
No.

1079
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:01,563
I want to make the broth in advance.

1080
00:44:01,564 --> 00:44:02,595
Okay.

1081
00:44:02,865 --> 00:44:05,865
(Leave it to me.)

1082
00:44:06,265 --> 00:44:08,405
(When Jun Myun pours water into the pot, )

1083
00:44:09,004 --> 00:44:12,735
(Jung Ah prepares the ingredients for the broth.)

1084
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:16,615
(Anchovies, kelp, dried shrimp, onions)

1085
00:44:17,044 --> 00:44:21,044
(Wait until the broth is infused.)

1086
00:44:21,945 --> 00:44:24,384
Should I julienne the zucchini?

1087
00:44:24,385 --> 00:44:25,414
- Julienne it.
- Okay.

1088
00:44:26,055 --> 00:44:27,654
Gosh, Jung Ah. When it comes to chopping,

1089
00:44:27,655 --> 00:44:30,294
- I am so bad at it.
- I see.

1090
00:44:30,524 --> 00:44:31,723
It's not working.

1091
00:44:31,724 --> 00:44:32,724
(Jun Myun isn't good at chopping the ingredients nicely.)

1092
00:44:32,725 --> 00:44:34,425
- I...
- Use this as a chance to learn it.

1093
00:44:34,524 --> 00:44:36,164
(Holding her laughing)

1094
00:44:37,934 --> 00:44:40,805
(The bit starts without warning.)

1095
00:44:41,535 --> 00:44:44,075
(Thick)

1096
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:45,874
(Staring)

1097
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:47,374
Are you chopping it into thick slices?

1098
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:49,345
- You don't like it, do you?
- No.

1099
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:52,414
(Gosh. Unbelievable.)

1100
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:53,683
It's hot.

1101
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:54,785
(Jun Myun is so cute.)

1102
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:56,754
The scariest thing in the world...

1103
00:44:57,084 --> 00:44:58,615
is an in-law's nitpicking.

1104
00:44:59,885 --> 00:45:02,683
(The funniest nitpicking of an "in-law")

1105
00:45:02,684 --> 00:45:03,754
Gosh.

1106
00:45:04,394 --> 00:45:07,365
(She washes the onion for the kalguksu.)

1107
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:10,663
Bring me a ladle when you come back outside.

1108
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:13,805
A ladle and a bowl for the froth.

1109
00:45:14,564 --> 00:45:16,905
- This one?
- That's too big.

1110
00:45:17,474 --> 00:45:18,734
I want to scoop out the froth.

1111
00:45:18,735 --> 00:45:20,445
Okay. You could have said that sooner.

1112
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:24,575
- I said froth earlier. Yes.
- Did you say froth just now?

1113
00:45:25,245 --> 00:45:27,515
- Is this all right?
- Yes.

1114
00:45:29,285 --> 00:45:31,414
I think she's a bit too old to fetch me things.

1115
00:45:33,015 --> 00:45:35,784
Gosh, girl, I think I'm ordering you around too much.

1116
00:45:35,785 --> 00:45:38,723
I'm usually not like this.

1117
00:45:38,724 --> 00:45:41,595
- Where's Dex?
- The kids should be here.

1118
00:45:43,195 --> 00:45:44,495
(Screaming)

1119
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:47,164
(The youngest siblings are still struggling against the waves.)

1120
00:45:47,635 --> 00:45:50,274
(Are the Venus clams really here?)

1121
00:45:50,704 --> 00:45:51,735
They're not here.

1122
00:45:53,204 --> 00:45:55,575
(Next to the youngest siblings who keep failing, )

1123
00:45:56,845 --> 00:46:00,715
(this Yeongdeok resident keeps diving...)

1124
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:04,854
(and catching Venus clams without a rush.)

1125
00:46:05,454 --> 00:46:06,554
(What should we do?)

1126
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,684
- Gosh.
- Hey.

1127
00:46:08,024 --> 00:46:11,294
Hey, shouldn't we at least...

1128
00:46:11,754 --> 00:46:12,754
catch three?

1129
00:46:13,394 --> 00:46:16,324
(The number of Venus clams they've caught so far: 0)

1130
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:17,334
Let's do this.

1131
00:46:18,465 --> 00:46:21,834
(But, Dex doesn't give up and runs his hand through the sand.)

1132
00:46:22,135 --> 00:46:23,235
(A wave hits him.)

1133
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:24,934
(Screaming)

1134
00:46:25,274 --> 00:46:27,504
(Water went up his nose.)

1135
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:30,813
Eun Jin. A clam.

1136
00:46:30,814 --> 00:46:33,115
(He finally caught a Venus clam.)

1137
00:46:34,414 --> 00:46:37,115
You caught one? Good job.

1138
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:40,084
(He finally caught their first Venus clam.)

1139
00:46:40,454 --> 00:46:42,084
(He goes back into the water right away.)

1140
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:47,925
(A Venus clam is slightly buried in the sand.)

1141
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:51,035
(He found another one.)

1142
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:53,534
(They may not be visible right away, )

1143
00:46:53,535 --> 00:46:54,535
(but you can still find them...)

1144
00:46:54,536 --> 00:46:55,735
(by running your hands through the sand.)

1145
00:46:56,774 --> 00:46:59,004
- Did you bring your clam rake?
- No, do you need it?

1146
00:46:59,874 --> 00:47:00,874
Let's go get the clam rakes.

1147
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,245
(If you're having trouble with your bare hands, )

1148
00:47:03,204 --> 00:47:07,044
(you should use tools.)

1149
00:47:08,414 --> 00:47:10,555
(She passes him a clam rake.)

1150
00:47:11,215 --> 00:47:13,454
(He goes back into the water right away.)

1151
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:18,354
(He runs the clam rake thoroughly through the sand.)

1152
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:21,794
(As he rakes through the sand, )

1153
00:47:22,765 --> 00:47:25,235
(he catches Venus clams in no time.)

1154
00:47:28,434 --> 00:47:30,405
(He caught a fistful of clams.)

1155
00:47:31,175 --> 00:47:32,175
Gosh.

1156
00:47:32,535 --> 00:47:33,845
(You're the best.)

1157
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:41,144
(The clam rakes are helping them work faster.)

1158
00:47:44,885 --> 00:47:45,953
- Eun Jin.
- Yes.

1159
00:47:45,954 --> 00:47:47,254
There are a whole bunch of clams.

1160
00:47:48,854 --> 00:47:50,054
There are a whole bunch of clams.

1161
00:47:50,055 --> 00:47:51,595
(With clam rakes, they can catch a whole bunch of clams anywhere.)

1162
00:47:53,024 --> 00:47:56,834
(Now let's go make money for their secret fund.)

1163
00:47:57,535 --> 00:48:00,434
(Eun Jin goes into the water too.)

1164
00:48:00,564 --> 00:48:03,504
(She's working hard despite her injury.)

1165
00:48:08,044 --> 00:48:09,075
Gosh.

1166
00:48:10,175 --> 00:48:13,175
(Not even the waves can extinguish her passion.)

1167
00:48:15,914 --> 00:48:19,354
(The youngest siblings are enjoying catching all those clams.)

1168
00:48:19,715 --> 00:48:21,885
This is fun.

1169
00:48:22,754 --> 00:48:25,425
(I got you!)

1170
00:48:25,925 --> 00:48:29,164
(The Venus clams are piling up.)

1171
00:48:30,164 --> 00:48:33,265
(He's even putting some in his pocket real quick.)

1172
00:48:33,604 --> 00:48:35,305
We caught so many.

1173
00:48:36,104 --> 00:48:37,104
Let's go.

1174
00:48:37,105 --> 00:48:39,273
(He passes the fistful of Venus clams he had in his pocket.)

1175
00:48:39,274 --> 00:48:40,345
Gosh.

1176
00:48:41,075 --> 00:48:43,644
(The more Venus clams they catch, the more secret fund they earn.)

1177
00:48:43,745 --> 00:48:44,814
Open it.

1178
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,245
(He goes through his pocket again.)

1179
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:53,155
You're the best.

1180
00:48:53,655 --> 00:48:54,884
You're the best.

1181
00:48:54,885 --> 00:48:56,354
(He adds another fistful of clams.)

1182
00:48:57,124 --> 00:48:58,724
You're amazing.

1183
00:49:00,425 --> 00:49:01,465
There's more?

1184
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:06,235
(He has deep pockets full of clams.)

1185
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:08,035
Let's stop here.

1186
00:49:09,235 --> 00:49:10,703
(I think we made enough money for our secret fund.)

1187
00:49:10,704 --> 00:49:11,974
Let's stop here.

1188
00:49:13,644 --> 00:49:16,974
(They feel proud about the heavy bucket of clams.)

1189
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,385
(Goodbye)

1190
00:49:24,854 --> 00:49:27,524
(How many Venus clams did they catch?)

1191
00:49:28,024 --> 00:49:29,184
- One.
- One.

1192
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:30,425
- Two.
- Two.

1193
00:49:30,624 --> 00:49:31,655
- Three.
- Three.

1194
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,094
- Four.
- Four.

1195
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,163
(They're piling up...)

1196
00:49:34,164 --> 00:49:36,195
(money for their secret fund.)

1197
00:49:36,465 --> 00:49:39,134
- Gosh.
- Forty, forty-one.

1198
00:49:39,135 --> 00:49:41,104
(Great job, youngest siblings.)

1199
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:44,334
- We caught 41.
- Wait.

1200
00:49:44,405 --> 00:49:47,444
- What?
- Wait, what's this?

1201
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:49,444
- What's this?
- Gosh.

1202
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,474
(He had more clams.)

1203
00:49:50,845 --> 00:49:53,473
Forty-two, forty-three, forty-four.

1204
00:49:53,474 --> 00:49:56,414
(What a great harvest.)

1205
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:01,654
Another one.

1206
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:02,683
(He throws in the 45th clam.)

1207
00:50:02,684 --> 00:50:04,655
- Unbelievable.
- We earned a lot of money.

1208
00:50:04,925 --> 00:50:07,325
Right. You're amazing.

1209
00:50:09,394 --> 00:50:11,664
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

1210
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:13,265
I wonder how much we made. About 17 dollars?

1211
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:16,905
- It should be...
- 18 dollars.

1212
00:50:17,334 --> 00:50:18,575
You're right. 18 dollars.

1213
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:22,175
- One, two, three. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1214
00:50:22,274 --> 00:50:24,014
(You did a great job of catching Venus clams.)

1215
00:50:24,015 --> 00:50:25,544
We're rich.

1216
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:29,043
- There are no more clams left here.
- Right.

1217
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:32,084
No one can dig Venus clams here anymore. I dug out all of them.

1218
00:50:32,515 --> 00:50:35,624
(They take the Venus clams they caught back home.)

1219
00:50:35,885 --> 00:50:36,885
Here.

1220
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:39,424
Take these. I caught all I need and...

1221
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:40,425
it seemed like you were having trouble.

1222
00:50:40,426 --> 00:50:43,265
- Gosh. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1223
00:50:43,894 --> 00:50:45,164
How are you so good at catching clams?

1224
00:50:45,664 --> 00:50:46,865
- I'm from here.
- I see.

1225
00:50:47,334 --> 00:50:48,404
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

1226
00:50:48,405 --> 00:50:49,464
Thank you.

1227
00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:51,934
(Thanks to his gift, they have plenty of seasonal ingredients.)

1228
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:53,904
We made a lot of money.

1229
00:50:53,905 --> 00:50:54,973
- Hey.
- What?

1230
00:50:54,974 --> 00:50:56,374
How much of these should we give to Jung Ah and Jun Myun?

1231
00:50:57,215 --> 00:50:58,544
We should give them two dollars each...

1232
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:00,785
like pocket money.

1233
00:51:01,715 --> 00:51:03,414
They can buy a popsicle each.

1234
00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:05,015
Right.

1235
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:09,785
(Meanwhile, Jung Ah's been stirring the jam so it wouldn't stick.)

1236
00:51:11,055 --> 00:51:12,223
It smells so good.

1237
00:51:12,224 --> 00:51:14,064
(It's nicely thickened.)

1238
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:17,635
(She adds lemon juice for a refreshing flavor.)

1239
00:51:19,135 --> 00:51:22,905
(The delicious, thick peach jam is complete.)

1240
00:51:23,434 --> 00:51:26,274
(She puts it in glass bottles for storage.)

1241
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:28,274
- How is it? Did you taste it?
- No.

1242
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,675
(She has a small bite of the leftover jam.)

1243
00:51:32,144 --> 00:51:33,414
(Gosh.)

1244
00:51:33,615 --> 00:51:34,914
Gosh, the flavor has depth.

1245
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:36,914
There's so much depth to it.

1246
00:51:37,285 --> 00:51:38,885
- Gosh, it's delicious.
- It's delicious.

1247
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:41,954
The aroma of the peach is strong in the jam.

1248
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:43,624
- It has so much flavor.
- Gosh.

1249
00:51:44,325 --> 00:51:45,624
When will the kids be back?

1250
00:51:48,365 --> 00:51:50,465
(The Venus clam expedition arrived home.)

1251
00:51:50,735 --> 00:51:51,833
- Hey.
- What?

1252
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:54,135
It's two dollars each.

1253
00:51:54,504 --> 00:51:56,304
- Don't forget.
- Two dollars each.

1254
00:51:56,305 --> 00:51:57,305
- Two dollars each.
- All right.

1255
00:51:58,675 --> 00:52:01,305
You give Jung Ah two dollars,

1256
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:03,543
and I'll give Jun Myun two dollars.

1257
00:52:03,544 --> 00:52:04,615
(They strategize until the last moment.)

1258
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:07,715
(Let's go!)

1259
00:52:08,715 --> 00:52:11,413
- Jung Ah, Jun Myun.
- We're back.

1260
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:12,814
We're back.

1261
00:52:13,254 --> 00:52:14,254
You're back.

1262
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:15,885
(She's glad to see them.)

1263
00:52:16,254 --> 00:52:17,294
How did it go?

1264
00:52:19,294 --> 00:52:21,223
- Jun Myun.
- What's wrong?

1265
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:23,294
- They must have struggled a lot.
- Who made you cry?

1266
00:52:24,595 --> 00:52:26,194
Did she work despite an injury again?

1267
00:52:26,195 --> 00:52:28,364
I worked despite my injury.

1268
00:52:28,365 --> 00:52:30,104
(She distracts Jung Ah and Jun Myun with her injured foot.)

1269
00:52:30,635 --> 00:52:32,734
We're here to give you pocket money.

1270
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:34,974
- How much did you make?
- Jun Myun.

1271
00:52:35,245 --> 00:52:36,274
How much?

1272
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:38,715
- Two dollars?
- Gosh.

1273
00:52:38,914 --> 00:52:41,084
- We made money.
- It was hard.

1274
00:52:42,885 --> 00:52:44,115
We made money for you.

1275
00:52:45,785 --> 00:52:47,253
- You earned two dollars?
- Right.

1276
00:52:47,254 --> 00:52:49,155
(They can't believe how little they made.)

1277
00:52:49,754 --> 00:52:50,794
Thank you for your efforts.

1278
00:52:51,825 --> 00:52:53,864
(They exchange glances.)

1279
00:52:53,865 --> 00:52:55,865
- Someone gave this to us.
- What?

1280
00:52:56,294 --> 00:52:57,964
- He was catching clams next to us.
- Really?

1281
00:52:57,965 --> 00:52:59,034
(They're attention moved on to the Venus clams immediately.)

1282
00:52:59,035 --> 00:53:01,364
- He was from Yeongdeok.
- He was a professional.

1283
00:53:01,365 --> 00:53:02,405
Gosh.

1284
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:05,373
- He was a Yeongdeok resident.
- This is what we caught.

1285
00:53:05,374 --> 00:53:06,534
(Bragging.)

1286
00:53:06,535 --> 00:53:08,603
- That's cool.
- This is...

1287
00:53:08,604 --> 00:53:09,745
You must have worked so hard, though.

1288
00:53:10,974 --> 00:53:12,044
Goodness.

1289
00:53:12,914 --> 00:53:13,985
They must have struggled a lot.

1290
00:53:14,914 --> 00:53:15,914
They must have struggled a lot.

1291
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,985
(Crying)

1292
00:53:19,055 --> 00:53:21,454
(The youngest siblings struggled and caught these Venus clams.)

1293
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:24,754
(How do residents of Yeongdeok eat these Venus clams?)

1294
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:28,124
(The house of Mr. Kim Won Nyeon, who gifted them the Venus clams)

1295
00:53:28,995 --> 00:53:30,425
They grow on the east coast.

1296
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:34,035
These clams were common since I was little.

1297
00:53:34,604 --> 00:53:37,305
(They cut up various vegetables, )

1298
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:42,044
(add raw Venus clam flesh on top, )

1299
00:53:44,245 --> 00:53:47,444
(and mix everything with vinegared red pepper paste...)

1300
00:53:47,445 --> 00:53:49,015
(to make raw fish bibimbap.)

1301
00:53:49,814 --> 00:53:53,115
(Look forward to Fresh off the Sea's Venus clam kalguksu.)

1302
00:53:53,655 --> 00:53:56,684
- I'll make fresh kimchi right now.
- Okay.

1303
00:53:57,454 --> 00:54:02,164
(You can't eat kalguksu without kimchi.)

1304
00:54:03,595 --> 00:54:06,035
Let's make fresh kimchi.

1305
00:54:08,365 --> 00:54:11,305
(Sauce Park makes a recipe on the spot.)

1306
00:54:12,235 --> 00:54:15,374
(She takes out the sauces from the fridge.)

1307
00:54:16,405 --> 00:54:18,845
(She creates the umami flavor with fish sauce and tuna fish sauce.)

1308
00:54:19,314 --> 00:54:20,344
Add in this.

1309
00:54:20,345 --> 00:54:21,785
(She adds a refreshing flavor with lemon juice and plum preserves.)

1310
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:25,055
I'll add perilla oil too.

1311
00:54:26,155 --> 00:54:27,155
Like this.

1312
00:54:27,156 --> 00:54:28,824
(The earthiness of perilla oil is added too.)

1313
00:54:28,825 --> 00:54:31,124
(She throws in spicy chili powder.)

1314
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:34,365
(Sauce Park mixes everything together with her hand.)

1315
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:38,334
(The fragrant fresh kimchi made with edible amaranth is complete!)

1316
00:54:40,704 --> 00:54:43,664
(How does Sauce Park's fresh kimchi taste?)

1317
00:54:44,204 --> 00:54:46,405
(Tasting)

1318
00:54:48,604 --> 00:54:49,643
That's good.

1319
00:54:49,644 --> 00:54:50,945
(No words are needed.)

1320
00:54:52,615 --> 00:54:53,615
- Jung Ah.
- Yes?

1321
00:54:53,615 --> 00:54:54,615
Try this.

1322
00:54:56,485 --> 00:54:57,715
Maybe I should have put...

1323
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:00,385
It's good.

1324
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:03,453
- It's good, right?
- Yes, it's delicious. Good job.

1325
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:04,724
(It's perfect for Jung Ah's palate too!)

1326
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:06,594
(Gosh)

1327
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:07,765
Edible amaranth is delicious.

1328
00:55:08,265 --> 00:55:09,594
- It smells great too.
- Right.

1329
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:11,394
(She made a partner to go with the kalguksu.)

1330
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:14,504
(Now it's time to make kalguksu.)

1331
00:55:15,504 --> 00:55:18,334
(She takes out the ingredients for the broth.)

1332
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:22,044
What else will you use to season the broth besides soup soy sauce?

1333
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:25,014
- Salt.
- Salt and soup soy sauce.

1334
00:55:25,015 --> 00:55:26,314
(She's planning on highlighting the flavor of the Venus clam.)

1335
00:55:26,575 --> 00:55:29,345
I'll use soup soy sauce now.

1336
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:31,554
The clams.

1337
00:55:31,555 --> 00:55:33,114
(Now it's time to put in the Venus clams.)

1338
00:55:33,115 --> 00:55:35,325
(In the broth Jung Ah made with care, )

1339
00:55:37,124 --> 00:55:38,424
This is going to be good.

1340
00:55:38,425 --> 00:55:40,294
(she puts in the Venus clams.)

1341
00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:46,063
I'll blanch the clams and take them out.

1342
00:55:46,064 --> 00:55:47,064
(Chef Yum's cooking tip: If you boil clams too long, )

1343
00:55:47,064 --> 00:55:48,064
(they'll lose their juices and become tough, so just blanch them.)

1344
00:55:48,065 --> 00:55:51,104
(She takes out the Venus clams in a hurry before they're cooked more.)

1345
00:55:52,035 --> 00:55:54,204
Gosh, the broth is white.

1346
00:55:57,544 --> 00:56:00,715
(Eun Jin is stuck to Jung Ah like gum.)

1347
00:56:00,885 --> 00:56:03,715
(Before they even realized, Eun Jin was stuck right next to Jung Ah.)

1348
00:56:04,555 --> 00:56:05,684
Gosh.

1349
00:56:06,184 --> 00:56:07,353
(Gulping)

1350
00:56:07,354 --> 00:56:08,884
- For the broth, I boiled...
- Gosh,

1351
00:56:08,885 --> 00:56:11,594
- that's insane.
- anchovies for a long time.

1352
00:56:11,595 --> 00:56:13,425
- Gosh, and you're adding clams?
- Yes.

1353
00:56:14,695 --> 00:56:17,265
Goodness.

1354
00:56:17,865 --> 00:56:21,104
Now, we'll boil this with the noodles and vegetables.

1355
00:56:21,204 --> 00:56:22,204
The noodles...

1356
00:56:22,205 --> 00:56:25,535
(She adds in the various vegetables they've cut up, )

1357
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:28,704
(and the noodles go inside too.)

1358
00:56:28,905 --> 00:56:32,745
(Now all they have to do is boil the soup.)

1359
00:56:32,845 --> 00:56:33,873
(Staring)

1360
00:56:33,874 --> 00:56:35,985
- Should we try the clams?
- Should we?

1361
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:37,044
Go ahead.

1362
00:56:38,184 --> 00:56:39,314
(Just one bite)

1363
00:56:40,414 --> 00:56:43,024
Wait, let me put one in your mouth. This is amazing.

1364
00:56:43,184 --> 00:56:45,325
- It's so chewy and nice.
- It's so delicious.

1365
00:56:46,095 --> 00:56:47,325
(Gosh)

1366
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:49,425
- The clams are so...
- They're seasoned nicely too.

1367
00:56:50,735 --> 00:56:53,364
(Her frown shows that she's telling the truth.)

1368
00:56:53,365 --> 00:56:55,204
(Yes, this is it.)

1369
00:56:55,905 --> 00:56:56,905
The broth is...

1370
00:56:57,135 --> 00:56:58,575
- Amazing.
- amazing.

1371
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,144
Do you need help with anything?

1372
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:03,473
- Now all that's left is...
- We're all done.

1373
00:57:03,474 --> 00:57:05,444
- to move these.
- All you have to do is move these.

1374
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:07,114
- Good work, Dex.
- It was nothing.

1375
00:57:07,115 --> 00:57:09,214
- Aren't you hungry?
- I'm starving.

1376
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:10,413
You played around in the water.

1377
00:57:10,414 --> 00:57:11,683
- Did labor in the water.
- Dug out clams.

1378
00:57:11,684 --> 00:57:13,154
- Dug out clams?
- Dug out clams.

1379
00:57:13,155 --> 00:57:15,523
When you walk around, do you stumble upon clams?

1380
00:57:15,524 --> 00:57:16,785
- No.
- You don't just pick them up?

1381
00:57:17,124 --> 00:57:18,794
We have to dig them out, so...

1382
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:20,424
- You have to go in the water?
- Yes.

1383
00:57:20,425 --> 00:57:23,023
You go inside the water, you rake around,

1384
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:24,434
and then you dig the clams out.

1385
00:57:25,294 --> 00:57:27,264
So you have your eyes open in the water?

1386
00:57:27,265 --> 00:57:29,703
- Yes, with snorkeling equipment.
- I see.

1387
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:30,804
(That's not an easy task.)

1388
00:57:30,805 --> 00:57:32,175
You had a full-on experience.

1389
00:57:32,235 --> 00:57:33,933
But the waves were too strong,

1390
00:57:33,934 --> 00:57:35,444
- so water kept going up our noses.
- Goodness.

1391
00:57:35,445 --> 00:57:36,503
It's boiling.

1392
00:57:36,504 --> 00:57:38,313
(The kalguksu is boiling.)

1393
00:57:38,314 --> 00:57:39,614
Bring me the clams.

1394
00:57:39,615 --> 00:57:40,615
- Okay.
- Okay.

1395
00:57:42,385 --> 00:57:45,083
Put them in.

1396
00:57:45,084 --> 00:57:48,284
Here they go.

1397
00:57:48,285 --> 00:57:52,254
(The blanched Venus clams go back into the pot.)

1398
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:57,224
(She mixes them in with the noodles.)

1399
00:57:57,294 --> 00:57:59,694
(The waves of white broth are full of Venus clams.)

1400
00:57:59,695 --> 00:58:01,535
- We have a lot of clams.
- Yes.

1401
00:58:02,265 --> 00:58:03,305
That's it.

1402
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:07,104
I need a ladle.

1403
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:08,575
(Bouncy)

1404
00:58:08,805 --> 00:58:12,115
(She fills the bowl with kalguksu.)

1405
00:58:12,215 --> 00:58:15,144
(Focused)

1406
00:58:16,215 --> 00:58:17,715
We have so many vegetables and clams.

1407
00:58:18,615 --> 00:58:20,114
Dex, can you sprinkle...

1408
00:58:20,115 --> 00:58:21,985
seaweed flakes on top of those?

1409
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:23,354
Yes, seaweed flakes.

1410
00:58:24,925 --> 00:58:25,994
These look so pretty.

1411
00:58:25,995 --> 00:58:28,064
(He sprinkles seaweed flakes on the kalguksu as the final touch.)

1412
00:58:28,524 --> 00:58:31,365
- All done. Let's move.
- Let's move.

1413
00:58:32,035 --> 00:58:34,095
Goodness. It's hot.

1414
00:58:36,664 --> 00:58:38,404
(They all groan as they take a seat.)

1415
00:58:38,405 --> 00:58:39,774
This is our lunch.

1416
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:44,215
(Spicy, sweet fresh kimchi made with seasonal edible amaranth)

1417
00:58:44,615 --> 00:58:48,945
(Kalguksu made with the Venus clams the youngest siblings caught)

1418
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,215
Eat.

1419
00:58:50,216 --> 00:58:52,515
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1420
00:58:53,414 --> 00:58:54,485
This looks delicious.

1421
00:58:55,055 --> 00:58:58,024
(She eats a spoonful.)

1422
00:58:59,624 --> 00:59:01,425
(It's hot.)

1423
00:59:01,595 --> 00:59:02,924
So you can pick them there.

1424
00:59:02,925 --> 00:59:05,495
(The youngest siblings who were hungry from working in the water)

1425
00:59:05,595 --> 00:59:07,635
(Blowing)

1426
00:59:07,735 --> 00:59:09,433
(Slurping)

1427
00:59:09,434 --> 00:59:11,434
- This kalguksu is...
- It's so delicious.

1428
00:59:12,474 --> 00:59:13,773
(Jun Myun tries a clam first.)

1429
00:59:13,774 --> 00:59:14,805
Should we go?

1430
00:59:15,874 --> 00:59:16,945
These Venus clams.

1431
00:59:17,245 --> 00:59:19,144
(Gosh)

1432
00:59:19,544 --> 00:59:21,684
Goodness, these clams are unbelievable.

1433
00:59:22,584 --> 00:59:24,215
These clams are different.

1434
00:59:25,985 --> 00:59:27,253
They have great texture.

1435
00:59:27,254 --> 00:59:29,254
(Venus clam flesh are juicy and chewy.)

1436
00:59:29,584 --> 00:59:31,594
This is my...

1437
00:59:31,595 --> 00:59:34,425
I've never heard of Venus clams before.

1438
00:59:34,695 --> 00:59:35,824
- These are so delicious.
- They are, right?

1439
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:36,825
Yes.

1440
00:59:37,394 --> 00:59:38,535
- Goodness.
- Right.

1441
00:59:39,934 --> 00:59:40,934
They're so good.

1442
00:59:40,935 --> 00:59:42,535
(Jung Ah is very pleased.)

1443
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,774
(I'll try the sweet fresh kimchi.)

1444
00:59:47,305 --> 00:59:48,473
This is good.

1445
00:59:48,474 --> 00:59:50,604
(Jung Ah has a huge bite too.)

1446
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:53,345
(Nodding)

1447
00:59:53,874 --> 00:59:55,644
Jun Myun's fresh kimchi is delicious too, isn't it?

1448
00:59:55,814 --> 00:59:57,015
It's so delicious.

1449
00:59:57,814 --> 00:59:59,254
You live up to your name, Sauce Park.

1450
01:00:00,115 --> 01:00:02,184
(Thumbs up)

1451
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:04,624
(The youngest has kimchi with kalguksu.)

1452
01:00:04,954 --> 01:00:06,924
We've been eating a lot of vegetables since we came here.

1453
01:00:06,925 --> 01:00:09,623
Right. We're getting healthier.

1454
01:00:09,624 --> 01:00:12,135
(Thanks to Jung Ah and Jun Myun, they're having great meals.)

1455
01:00:13,035 --> 01:00:14,905
This must have taken a lot of work.

1456
01:00:16,204 --> 01:00:18,174
It's not easy to cook in front of a fire.

1457
01:00:18,175 --> 01:00:19,175
- Right.
- Right.

1458
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:21,474
In this heat.

1459
01:00:23,175 --> 01:00:24,844
It would have been nice if Hae Jin could eat this too.

1460
01:00:24,845 --> 01:00:25,914
- Right.
- Yes.

1461
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:29,344
He was here only for a day, but he must have enjoyed it.

1462
01:00:29,345 --> 01:00:30,684
- Really?
- On his way back,

1463
01:00:31,954 --> 01:00:33,784
he said it felt like only half a day.

1464
01:00:33,785 --> 01:00:35,385
(Time flew by so quickly.)

1465
01:00:35,854 --> 01:00:37,694
I'm glad he felt that way.

1466
01:00:37,695 --> 01:00:38,695
- Yes.
- Yes.

1467
01:00:40,155 --> 01:00:42,495
(Thinking)

1468
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:44,965
The people who come here as guests...

1469
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,734
are all kind of like you, Jung Ah.

1470
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:48,735
Right.

1471
01:00:48,736 --> 01:00:51,575
(Is being like Jung Ah a requirement for the guests?)

1472
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:54,373
- They're so...
- They're neat.

1473
01:00:54,374 --> 01:00:55,904
- They're really neat.
- And diligent.

1474
01:00:55,905 --> 01:00:57,614
They're diligent, and they're early risers.

1475
01:00:57,615 --> 01:00:59,314
Right. And good cooks.

1476
01:00:59,544 --> 01:01:00,814
They clean too.

1477
01:01:01,544 --> 01:01:03,314
(She loves it.)

1478
01:01:03,544 --> 01:01:05,253
I'm definitely not like that.

1479
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:06,313
Me neither.

1480
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:08,425
(Who will be the next guest to visit Fresh off the Sea?)

1481
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:13,294
(They finished their last meal in Yeongdeok.)

1482
01:01:16,695 --> 01:01:19,164
(2 weeks later)

1483
01:01:22,164 --> 01:01:25,873
(Even the ever-bright Eun Jin cried.)

1484
01:01:25,874 --> 01:01:27,204
I'm scared.

1485
01:01:28,405 --> 01:01:29,405
I feel light-headed.

1486
01:01:29,406 --> 01:01:32,314
(And even the strong Captain Yum collapsed.)

1487
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:35,183
(The third destination of their seasonal blockbuster...)

1488
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:37,885
(begins now.)

1489
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:47,995
(A man walks into a restaurant.)

1490
01:01:54,865 --> 01:01:57,305
(Cha Tae Hyun, Actor)

1491
01:01:58,374 --> 01:01:59,873
(Filmography: "Moving," "Along with the Gods,")

1492
01:01:59,874 --> 01:02:01,544
("Scandal Makers," "Highway Star")

1493
01:02:02,345 --> 01:02:05,414
(Cha Tae Hyun is visiting Fresh off the Sea.)

1494
01:02:05,575 --> 01:02:07,715
Hello. Why isn't anyone here?

1495
01:02:09,115 --> 01:02:11,254
(The restaurant is empty.)

1496
01:02:11,954 --> 01:02:13,114
Why isn't anyone here?

1497
01:02:13,115 --> 01:02:14,254
(Is this not Fresh off the Sea?)

1498
01:02:14,454 --> 01:02:16,154
Gosh, I left home at 5am.

1499
01:02:16,155 --> 01:02:17,155
(The guest arrived too early.)

1500
01:02:18,095 --> 01:02:19,095
This is too far from home.

1501
01:02:21,164 --> 01:02:23,664
(This place that is too far for Tae Hyun is...)

1502
01:02:23,925 --> 01:02:26,094
(Goseong, Gangwon Province.)

1503
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:27,735
(It's not Goseong, Gangwon Province.)

1504
01:02:28,135 --> 01:02:30,364
(It's an area by the South Sea.)

1505
01:02:30,365 --> 01:02:32,075
(Goseong-gun, South Gyeongsang Province)

1506
01:02:32,735 --> 01:02:36,075
(It's located at the Southern end of the country.)

1507
01:02:37,104 --> 01:02:40,615
(There are many islands, and the water is clear.)

1508
01:02:41,285 --> 01:02:44,044
(Under the bright sun and the clear air, )

1509
01:02:46,215 --> 01:02:49,325
(corns grow in the sea breeze, )

1510
01:02:51,224 --> 01:02:53,594
(along with kiwifruits...)

1511
01:02:53,595 --> 01:02:55,825
(and blueberries.)

1512
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:01,305
(In the blue offing of Goseong, )

1513
01:03:02,664 --> 01:03:05,204
(a lot of fresh fish are caught.)

1514
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:10,204
(But the most precious of all is...)

1515
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,744
(the pike eel.)

1516
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:14,215
Hamo, another name for pike eels, is Japanese.

1517
01:03:14,414 --> 01:03:16,844
It means "to bite."

1518
01:03:16,845 --> 01:03:17,853
(Pike eels have sharp teeth.)

1519
01:03:17,854 --> 01:03:21,223
The fish here are all plump and nice.

1520
01:03:21,224 --> 01:03:22,984
Goseong is known for pike eels.

1521
01:03:22,985 --> 01:03:24,325
(Goseong is known for pike eels.)

1522
01:03:25,754 --> 01:03:28,023
We have plenty of seafood here, in Goseong.

1523
01:03:28,024 --> 01:03:29,124
(The meals in Goseong are full of pike eels in the summer.)

1524
01:03:29,394 --> 01:03:31,663
They're good to eat starting from May...

1525
01:03:31,664 --> 01:03:32,865
to September and October.

1526
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,965
(The home of the pike eel, Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province)

1527
01:03:37,805 --> 01:03:40,035
(A restaurant by the harbor)

1528
01:03:41,245 --> 01:03:43,274
- Hamo means pike eel?
- Yes.

1529
01:03:43,604 --> 01:03:45,313
(Hamo sashimi, hamo shabu-shabu, grilled hamo, eel soup)

1530
01:03:45,314 --> 01:03:46,444
(The menu only serves dishes with pike eel.)

1531
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:47,615
This is an eel place.

1532
01:03:49,084 --> 01:03:50,084
Pike eels.

1533
01:03:51,615 --> 01:03:53,183
(Concerned)

1534
01:03:53,184 --> 01:03:55,485
Do you catch the pike eels?

1535
01:03:55,985 --> 01:03:57,925
(Do you catch them?)

1536
01:03:58,294 --> 01:04:01,124
Yes. We're the original village to catch them.

1537
01:04:01,564 --> 01:04:04,534
(On the southern end of Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province)

1538
01:04:04,535 --> 01:04:07,293
For a long time, our village has been catching the most pike eels...

1539
01:04:07,294 --> 01:04:09,135
in Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province.

1540
01:04:09,905 --> 01:04:12,834
People come here just to eat pike eels.

1541
01:04:14,874 --> 01:04:16,704
(Facepalm)

1542
01:04:16,905 --> 01:04:20,215
It feels like we'll be catching pike eels today.

1543
01:04:21,684 --> 01:04:23,114
(The ingredient they'll be catching fresh off the sea today is...)

1544
01:04:23,115 --> 01:04:24,985
(pike eel?)

1545
01:04:26,584 --> 01:04:29,555
(Tae Hyun is worried at the thought of joining a fishing operation.)

1546
01:04:29,985 --> 01:04:33,424
(But who is Tae Hyun's acquaintance at Fresh off the Sea?)

1547
01:04:33,425 --> 01:04:36,425
Jung Ah's sikhye was delicious, though.

1548
01:04:36,724 --> 01:04:39,234
Back when we filmed "Unexpected Business" in the US,

1549
01:04:39,235 --> 01:04:42,034
it was very popular.

1550
01:04:42,035 --> 01:04:44,774
(Jung Ah taught her best friend, Tae Hyun, her sikhye recipe.)

1551
01:04:45,575 --> 01:04:47,675
(This is so delicious.)

1552
01:04:48,745 --> 01:04:52,774
(She's a famous actress in Korea.)

1553
01:04:53,374 --> 01:04:55,184
(She made a cameo appearance with the standing signboard.)

1554
01:04:55,885 --> 01:04:59,914
(The Yum Sikhye recipe caught the tastes of foreigners too.)

1555
01:05:00,454 --> 01:05:01,984
- Good.
- Good?

1556
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,624
Yes. It's good.

1557
01:05:04,224 --> 01:05:06,195
(He came to repay her for the sikhye.)

1558
01:05:09,595 --> 01:05:13,264
If these people haven't arrived yet,

1559
01:05:13,265 --> 01:05:14,334
what do I do?

1560
01:05:16,164 --> 01:05:17,833
(Tae Hyun seems to have a lot in his mind.)

1561
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:19,604
What do I do before they come?

1562
01:05:21,135 --> 01:05:24,305
I watched Jung Min's episode.

1563
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:26,445
He came like the owner of the fields.

1564
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:28,744
Then I'll...

1565
01:05:28,745 --> 01:05:29,845
(I should do something too.)

1566
01:05:30,285 --> 01:05:33,754
But should I put on an apron?

1567
01:05:35,925 --> 01:05:37,784
(After Tae Hyun, )

1568
01:05:37,785 --> 01:05:39,894
(Jun Myun has arrived.)

1569
01:05:40,825 --> 01:05:44,965
Gosh, what will happen today?

1570
01:05:45,064 --> 01:05:46,293
Gosh, the weather is...

1571
01:05:46,294 --> 01:05:48,503
(The scorching heat of Goseong's summer)

1572
01:05:48,504 --> 01:05:51,374
What will we eat today?

1573
01:05:51,635 --> 01:05:52,804
(Hello.)

1574
01:05:52,805 --> 01:05:54,434
Hello.

1575
01:05:54,604 --> 01:05:56,575
Hello.

1576
01:05:57,945 --> 01:05:59,043
(Where's Tae Hyun?)

1577
01:05:59,044 --> 01:06:00,445
We can sit like this.

1578
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:02,944
(Am I first?)

1579
01:06:02,945 --> 01:06:04,544
Pike eel?

1580
01:06:05,385 --> 01:06:07,155
I see. There's pike eel.

1581
01:06:09,724 --> 01:06:10,925
Do you like pike eel?

1582
01:06:11,695 --> 01:06:13,454
It's something to die for.

1583
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:17,164
(Jun Myun enjoys the seafood in season.)

1584
01:06:18,995 --> 01:06:21,703
- How nice.
- I think Jun Myun is already here.

1585
01:06:21,704 --> 01:06:23,204
Right. I think so too.

1586
01:06:23,305 --> 01:06:25,434
What will we get for breakfast?

1587
01:06:25,805 --> 01:06:27,103
- I'm excited.
- Right.

1588
01:06:27,104 --> 01:06:29,305
The meals we get become the clue.

1589
01:06:32,245 --> 01:06:34,015
Pike eel?

1590
01:06:34,175 --> 01:06:36,284
(Pike eel)

1591
01:06:36,285 --> 01:06:37,814
- Hold on.
- Pike eel?

1592
01:06:38,184 --> 01:06:39,255
Isn't that Jun Myun?

1593
01:06:39,655 --> 01:06:40,714
Jun Myun!

1594
01:06:42,024 --> 01:06:43,254
Hurry up!

1595
01:06:43,255 --> 01:06:44,825
Pike eel?

1596
01:06:44,924 --> 01:06:46,224
- Pike eel?
- Pike eel?

1597
01:06:47,195 --> 01:06:49,995
(The fish tank in front is filled with pike eels.)

1598
01:06:51,865 --> 01:06:52,995
Hurry up!

1599
01:06:53,464 --> 01:06:56,263
- Are you here? Gosh.
- Hello.

1600
01:06:56,264 --> 01:06:58,103
Gosh, you have pigtails today.

1601
01:06:58,104 --> 01:06:59,904
- We should sit like this.
- Come this way.

1602
01:06:59,905 --> 01:07:01,803
- Gosh.
- You're here, Eun Jin.

1603
01:07:01,804 --> 01:07:03,504
It's like we've met for the first time.

1604
01:07:03,505 --> 01:07:05,814
You even used the blusher.

1605
01:07:05,915 --> 01:07:07,774
Didn't you apply a bit too much?

1606
01:07:08,585 --> 01:07:09,713
Is it too red?

1607
01:07:09,714 --> 01:07:11,014
- Gosh.
- Did I do too much of it?

1608
01:07:11,214 --> 01:07:12,383
(Let's see.)

1609
01:07:12,384 --> 01:07:13,813
- Gosh.
- It's pike eel.

1610
01:07:13,814 --> 01:07:15,485
- Right.
- What do we do later?

1611
01:07:15,655 --> 01:07:17,023
- That's what I'm saying.
- This is driving me crazy.

1612
01:07:17,024 --> 01:07:18,324
Eels will drive me crazy.

1613
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,195
(They can already picture the 2 days and 3 nights in Goseong.)

1614
01:07:22,224 --> 01:07:23,393
- Jun Myun.
- Yes?

1615
01:07:23,394 --> 01:07:25,464
- The youngest won't be here today.
- Right.

1616
01:07:26,695 --> 01:07:27,695
(I'm sorry, sisters. I'll be there after my work in the morning.)

1617
01:07:27,696 --> 01:07:28,864
(There's nothing you can do about that.)

1618
01:07:28,865 --> 01:07:30,063
(Get here as soon as possible as we miss you.)

1619
01:07:30,064 --> 01:07:31,164
(Let's move around quickly, youngest one.)

1620
01:07:31,165 --> 01:07:33,875
- I will try to fill in Dex's spot.
- He'll come later, right?

1621
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,173
When will he get here?

1622
01:07:36,174 --> 01:07:37,205
I don't know.

1623
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:40,143
(In the corner of the restaurant, )

1624
01:07:40,144 --> 01:07:42,684
(there's someone hiding.)

1625
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:44,955
I can't believe this.

1626
01:07:46,184 --> 01:07:47,553
(Today's guest is watching secretly.)

1627
01:07:47,554 --> 01:07:48,585
My gosh.

1628
01:07:49,924 --> 01:07:51,455
The timing is off today.

1629
01:07:52,695 --> 01:07:54,295
Why did I come on a day Dex isn't here?

1630
01:07:56,094 --> 01:07:58,964
(These three don't have a clue about the guest waiting.)

1631
01:07:59,695 --> 01:08:02,165
Won't they figure it out once I start speaking anyway?

1632
01:08:03,165 --> 01:08:05,473
Should I go, "What would you like?"

1633
01:08:05,474 --> 01:08:06,535
With an accent.

1634
01:08:07,705 --> 01:08:09,705
"Hello."

1635
01:08:10,104 --> 01:08:13,575
"Gosh, there are celebrities here."

1636
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,444
(He's enjoying it.)

1637
01:08:15,445 --> 01:08:18,655
"Gosh, we have celebrities."

1638
01:08:19,655 --> 01:08:21,423
So are we going to...

1639
01:08:21,424 --> 01:08:24,125
get on the boat and catch eels today?

1640
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,454
I'm not sure.

1641
01:08:26,455 --> 01:08:29,665
I don't think we'll be the ones catching the eels.

1642
01:08:31,764 --> 01:08:32,764
I'm not sure.

1643
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:34,664
- Are they raised in an eel farm?
- I'm completely blank.

1644
01:08:34,665 --> 01:08:37,704
- Me too. I didn't think about it.
- It's better not to think about it.

1645
01:08:37,705 --> 01:08:38,874
- It makes no difference...
- Right.

1646
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:41,504
- with knowing about it anyway.
- Right.

1647
01:08:41,505 --> 01:08:42,643
We just go with the flow now.

1648
01:08:42,644 --> 01:08:44,144
(It is what it is.)

1649
01:08:45,115 --> 01:08:47,115
Let's see what we'll get for our meal first.

1650
01:08:48,144 --> 01:08:49,214
Gosh, there's a lot.

1651
01:08:51,115 --> 01:08:52,784
Gosh.

1652
01:08:52,785 --> 01:08:54,584
My goodness.

1653
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:57,024
(Here I come.)

1654
01:08:57,224 --> 01:08:58,295
Gosh.

1655
01:08:58,695 --> 01:09:00,053
(The server comes with big steps.)

1656
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:01,324
Gosh.

1657
01:09:01,325 --> 01:09:02,664
It wasn't there?

1658
01:09:02,665 --> 01:09:03,893
(There's our food.)

1659
01:09:03,894 --> 01:09:05,035
- What?
- What?

1660
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:06,634
- What?
- What?

1661
01:09:06,695 --> 01:09:08,063
(Gosh)

1662
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:09,665
- Gosh.
- No way!

1663
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:12,335
(She's trying to understand the situation.)

1664
01:09:13,974 --> 01:09:15,004
No way!

1665
01:09:15,005 --> 01:09:17,104
My goodness. Who are these people?

1666
01:09:17,705 --> 01:09:21,144
How did you find our restaurant?

1667
01:09:21,344 --> 01:09:23,384
I was so surprised.

1668
01:09:23,485 --> 01:09:24,614
Hello.

1669
01:09:24,615 --> 01:09:26,353
- Hello.
- Hello.

1670
01:09:26,354 --> 01:09:27,713
Nice to meet you.

1671
01:09:27,714 --> 01:09:28,825
Tae Hyun!

1672
01:09:29,884 --> 01:09:31,554
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

1673
01:09:31,894 --> 01:09:33,053
I can't believe this.

1674
01:09:33,054 --> 01:09:34,054
- What is going on?
- Here you are.

1675
01:09:34,055 --> 01:09:35,763
- Here you are.
- Gosh, thank you.

1676
01:09:35,764 --> 01:09:37,864
- Gosh, Tae Hyun!
- Are you serious?

1677
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:40,133
Enjoy your meal.

1678
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,734
I just found out about this here.

1679
01:09:41,735 --> 01:09:43,535
- Dex won't be here.
- Right.

1680
01:09:45,804 --> 01:09:48,405
I'll get going now.

1681
01:09:49,705 --> 01:09:50,774
What?

1682
01:09:51,405 --> 01:09:54,013
It'll be too tough for me to fill in Dex's spot.

1683
01:09:54,014 --> 01:09:55,143
We might be catching eels.

1684
01:09:55,144 --> 01:09:57,344
Exactly.

1685
01:09:57,615 --> 01:09:59,454
I had a strange feeling while I was coming here.

1686
01:09:59,455 --> 01:10:01,954
- You'll be fine.
- No. I'm going to take his part.

1687
01:10:01,955 --> 01:10:03,923
- Are you staying for two nights?
- No.

1688
01:10:03,924 --> 01:10:07,423
Gosh. Don't say things like that.

1689
01:10:07,424 --> 01:10:08,963
You know how these people are.

1690
01:10:08,964 --> 01:10:10,593
- It's my first time seeing him.
- Me too.

1691
01:10:10,594 --> 01:10:12,563
- It's fascinating.
- Right.

1692
01:10:12,564 --> 01:10:14,534
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1693
01:10:14,535 --> 01:10:16,004
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hello.

1694
01:10:16,005 --> 01:10:17,303
- It's your first time seeing him?
- Yes.

1695
01:10:17,304 --> 01:10:19,773
- It's my first time seeing him.
- Me too.

1696
01:10:19,774 --> 01:10:22,204
I saw Dr. Choo briefly...

1697
01:10:22,205 --> 01:10:24,004
when I walked by her "You Quiz on the Block" shoot.

1698
01:10:24,005 --> 01:10:25,773
You're right. That was a long time ago.

1699
01:10:25,774 --> 01:10:26,973
He calls you Dr. Choo.

1700
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:28,184
- From "Hospital Playlist." - Right.

1701
01:10:28,814 --> 01:10:29,914
It's great to meet you.

1702
01:10:29,915 --> 01:10:32,284
- Aren't you two the same age?
- I was born in 1976.

1703
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:34,814
- I see.
- Oh, right. We're the same age.

1704
01:10:35,985 --> 01:10:38,594
(Awkward, shy, embarrassed)

1705
01:10:38,724 --> 01:10:41,194
Gosh, I didn't expect him to come on the first day.

1706
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,964
Right.

1707
01:10:43,325 --> 01:10:45,463
- I keep sticking to you.
- Why are you sticking to me?

1708
01:10:45,464 --> 01:10:47,063
It feels a bit awkward as it's our first time seeing each other.

1709
01:10:47,064 --> 01:10:49,205
- Right.
- Gosh, Tae Hyun.

1710
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,603
We have to catch or collect the ingredients...

1711
01:10:51,604 --> 01:10:53,434
- based on what's served.
- Right.

1712
01:10:53,604 --> 01:10:56,103
I didn't exactly know what the pike eel was.

1713
01:10:56,104 --> 01:10:57,704
After hearing that it's a type of eel,

1714
01:10:57,705 --> 01:10:59,745
I feel a bit anxious.

1715
01:11:00,514 --> 01:11:03,414
You should be aware of this.

1716
01:11:03,415 --> 01:11:04,784
- Dex and I...
- Yes?

1717
01:11:04,785 --> 01:11:06,614
- are different in capabilities.
- Different?

1718
01:11:06,615 --> 01:11:08,924
- It's not just different.
- It's completely different?

1719
01:11:09,354 --> 01:11:12,194
I might be similar to you.

1720
01:11:12,195 --> 01:11:13,224
Really?

1721
01:11:14,094 --> 01:11:16,563
I'm quite known for my capabilities with doing these things.

1722
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:18,434
- You're bad at doing these things?
- Yes.

1723
01:11:18,634 --> 01:11:20,633
You did well at the cashier in the supermarket.

1724
01:11:20,634 --> 01:11:23,134
I can do well with things that need a lot of talking.

1725
01:11:23,434 --> 01:11:24,904
- When it comes to strength, - Really?

1726
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:28,244
I'm completely useless.

1727
01:11:28,245 --> 01:11:29,905
Did you not hear about what this show is about?

1728
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,045
I didn't hear anything from anyone.

1729
01:11:32,575 --> 01:11:34,144
I just watched the show.

1730
01:11:34,474 --> 01:11:37,244
This was how things were done.

1731
01:11:37,245 --> 01:11:39,354
- When you eat something here, - You have to figure it out.

1732
01:11:39,585 --> 01:11:42,353
It could be the corn that you have to collect.

1733
01:11:42,354 --> 01:11:43,354
It's based on the ingredients.

1734
01:11:44,785 --> 01:11:46,154
Is it corn?

1735
01:11:46,155 --> 01:11:48,094
- Is it corn?
- Is it corn?

1736
01:11:48,564 --> 01:11:49,825
- There are two corn cobs.
- Broccoli?

1737
01:11:51,024 --> 01:11:54,835
(The corn came under the radar of the four siblings.)

1738
01:11:56,165 --> 01:11:58,134
Well, anyway,

1739
01:11:58,235 --> 01:12:00,774
it's a habit for me not to eat the food given by the staff.

1740
01:12:01,505 --> 01:12:03,673
You were out in the wild...

1741
01:12:03,674 --> 01:12:05,173
- He has done this a lot.
- in a variety show.

1742
01:12:05,174 --> 01:12:08,714
You shouldn't even touch things like anchovies.

1743
01:12:08,985 --> 01:12:12,085
- Anchovies were tough.
- Anchovies or shrimp.

1744
01:12:12,255 --> 01:12:13,553
You shouldn't even touch them.

1745
01:12:13,554 --> 01:12:16,154
But these people will take you there no matter what.

1746
01:12:16,155 --> 01:12:17,354
Things have changed.

1747
01:12:18,795 --> 01:12:19,825
Originally...

1748
01:12:19,995 --> 01:12:22,694
(Today's breakfast meal appears.)

1749
01:12:22,695 --> 01:12:23,825
Gosh.

1750
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:26,535
- Thank you.
- It's raw pike eel.

1751
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,433
(He continues to serve the food as he as the apron on.)

1752
01:12:28,434 --> 01:12:30,304
Gosh, look at the pike eel.

1753
01:12:30,964 --> 01:12:33,473
Gosh, how is this eaten?

1754
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,075
- My goodness.
- What is this?

1755
01:12:36,575 --> 01:12:38,574
- Look at the sauce.
- My goodness.

1756
01:12:38,575 --> 01:12:41,013
- What is all this for breakfast?
- Shall we put this to the side?

1757
01:12:41,014 --> 01:12:42,184
- This will be the main dish.
- Sure.

1758
01:12:43,344 --> 01:12:44,414
My goodness.

1759
01:12:44,415 --> 01:12:45,455
(Fluffy and chewy raw pike eel)

1760
01:12:48,884 --> 01:12:52,624
With the pike eel, rather than having a savory taste,

1761
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:55,023
it has a clean taste. It doesn't smelly fishy too.

1762
01:12:55,024 --> 01:12:56,394
Even if you touch it with your bare hands,

1763
01:12:56,495 --> 01:12:58,394
it's clean and doesn't have a fishy smell.

1764
01:12:59,865 --> 01:13:00,893
(An average of 140 slices must be made for each pike eel.)

1765
01:13:00,894 --> 01:13:02,803
Even the bones are good,

1766
01:13:02,804 --> 01:13:04,304
so it has to be sliced finely.

1767
01:13:04,564 --> 01:13:06,904
That way, the bones won't get stuck on your throat.

1768
01:13:06,905 --> 01:13:08,134
(Tender and chewy texture)

1769
01:13:08,945 --> 01:13:11,945
(Raw pike eel sliced finely with the bones)

1770
01:13:15,314 --> 01:13:19,014
(After making cuts without slicing them, )

1771
01:13:21,755 --> 01:13:24,054
(they are grilled.)

1772
01:13:26,224 --> 01:13:29,325
(The sweet and spicy sauce goes well with them.)

1773
01:13:31,264 --> 01:13:34,995
(Grilled pike eel)

1774
01:13:36,104 --> 01:13:38,603
(Doenjang and dried radish greens are added to the broth...)

1775
01:13:38,604 --> 01:13:40,273
(made with pike eel bones.)

1776
01:13:40,274 --> 01:13:44,445
(The refreshing and savory eel soup)

1777
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:50,584
(A meal with pike eels in season)

1778
01:13:50,585 --> 01:13:52,853
They are in season, so eat all you can.

1779
01:13:52,854 --> 01:13:54,053
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1780
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:56,223
- Thank you for the meal.
- How are they caught?

1781
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:58,624
There's a fishing gear called the longline.

1782
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:01,125
They are caught only by fishing.

1783
01:14:01,155 --> 01:14:03,523
- I see.
- They aren't caught with nets.

1784
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:05,535
(Longline: A long fishing line that has many fishhooks)

1785
01:14:06,365 --> 01:14:09,103
They are caught only by fishing.

1786
01:14:09,104 --> 01:14:11,734
That is how the pike eels are caught.

1787
01:14:11,735 --> 01:14:12,835
(The pike eels are reeled in with a machine.)

1788
01:14:16,945 --> 01:14:19,614
Put different vegetables inside the bowl.

1789
01:14:19,615 --> 01:14:21,813
Mix it with some chojang...

1790
01:14:21,814 --> 01:14:23,445
and try it like that. It's very good.

1791
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:26,314
I'll show you how it's done.

1792
01:14:27,415 --> 01:14:30,524
(Put in the vegetables first.)

1793
01:14:32,325 --> 01:14:33,554
(This is mesmerizing.)

1794
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:36,063
(Add a spoon of the spicy and sour chojang.)

1795
01:14:36,064 --> 01:14:37,264
(Add another spoon of the spicy and sour chojang.)

1796
01:14:37,825 --> 01:14:39,933
(This is mesmerizing.)

1797
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,734
(On top of the sashimi salad with chojang, )

1798
01:14:41,735 --> 01:14:44,764
(it will taste savory with some bean powder on top.)

1799
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:48,904
- Mix it together?
- Yes. You can add all of it.

1800
01:14:48,905 --> 01:14:50,075
I see.

1801
01:14:51,505 --> 01:14:54,075
(Glossy pike eel sashimi salad)

1802
01:14:54,214 --> 01:14:56,084
- Shall we give it a try?
- Yes.

1803
01:14:56,085 --> 01:14:57,183
- How do we eat this?
- Enjoy your meal.

1804
01:14:57,184 --> 01:14:58,214
Eat as much as you can.

1805
01:15:01,115 --> 01:15:04,054
(Jung Ah takes a bite of the sashimi salad first.)

1806
01:15:05,424 --> 01:15:06,424
Like this?

1807
01:15:06,755 --> 01:15:08,593
Gosh. It's really savory.

1808
01:15:08,594 --> 01:15:09,594
- It's savory, right?
- Yes.

1809
01:15:10,394 --> 01:15:12,665
(Tae Hyun takes a bite too.)

1810
01:15:13,665 --> 01:15:15,464
This will be great for your diet.

1811
01:15:15,564 --> 01:15:17,835
(He even sucks his chopsticks.)

1812
01:15:18,575 --> 01:15:21,335
(She makes the sashimi salad the way the owner taught her.)

1813
01:15:21,474 --> 01:15:23,474
(A generous amount of vegetables)

1814
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:26,974
(How does the pike eel sashimi salad taste?)

1815
01:15:28,415 --> 01:15:30,115
- This is the pike eel too.
- It's so delicious.

1816
01:15:30,314 --> 01:15:31,643
(A taste that makes your eyes open wide)

1817
01:15:31,644 --> 01:15:32,714
- It's so delicious.
- It's savory.

1818
01:15:33,415 --> 01:15:35,723
- It's so clean...
- It's so delicious.

1819
01:15:35,724 --> 01:15:36,724
And it's savory too.

1820
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:39,994
This will be great for your diet. This will help you lose weight.

1821
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:42,223
- Right. Do you like it?
- Yes.

1822
01:15:42,224 --> 01:15:43,263
(A clean taste without any fat)

1823
01:15:43,264 --> 01:15:44,295
It's really clean, right?

1824
01:15:44,724 --> 01:15:47,795
(It fits perfectly with chojang.)

1825
01:15:48,934 --> 01:15:50,535
This is the pike eel too.

1826
01:15:51,405 --> 01:15:52,574
I should try this too.

1827
01:15:52,575 --> 01:15:54,134
(She takes a bite of the grilled pike eel.)

1828
01:15:57,445 --> 01:15:58,843
(You should try this too.)

1829
01:15:58,844 --> 01:15:59,914
Try this.

1830
01:15:59,915 --> 01:16:00,915
Right.

1831
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:02,915
(Let's give it a try then.)

1832
01:16:03,314 --> 01:16:05,485
(A taste that brings you a big smile)

1833
01:16:05,684 --> 01:16:08,254
It's my first time having eel like this.

1834
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:09,485
- Really?
- Grilled eel?

1835
01:16:10,384 --> 01:16:12,124
It's your first time trying pike eels too, right?

1836
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:13,195
It's my first time trying them.

1837
01:16:15,394 --> 01:16:18,424
The corn tastes special too.

1838
01:16:18,695 --> 01:16:21,195
- Right.
- Have you tried the corn?

1839
01:16:21,764 --> 01:16:22,835
This one?

1840
01:16:24,035 --> 01:16:26,735
(Corn was served as side dishes.)

1841
01:16:28,405 --> 01:16:30,075
The grains are sticky.

1842
01:16:30,974 --> 01:16:31,974
Give them a try.

1843
01:16:31,975 --> 01:16:33,414
We only had the corn from Gangwon Province.

1844
01:16:33,415 --> 01:16:34,813
- But this is so delicious.
- It's amazing, isn't it?

1845
01:16:34,814 --> 01:16:36,084
(Chewy)

1846
01:16:36,085 --> 01:16:37,514
- The corn is really good.
- Right.

1847
01:16:38,514 --> 01:16:39,514
It's chewy, isn't it?

1848
01:16:40,585 --> 01:16:41,585
The corn is good.

1849
01:16:41,586 --> 01:16:42,723
(A taste that doesn't let you stop picking the grains off)

1850
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:43,985
- It's really chewy, isn't it?
- Yes.

1851
01:16:46,455 --> 01:16:51,093
How did the two of you get to know each other?

1852
01:16:51,094 --> 01:16:52,633
We saw each other often when we were young.

1853
01:16:52,634 --> 01:16:54,933
- You never worked together?
- We never worked together.

1854
01:16:54,934 --> 01:16:56,764
- I see.
- We worked together once.

1855
01:16:57,564 --> 01:17:00,075
- Did we do something together?
- It was called "Sad Movie."

1856
01:17:00,974 --> 01:17:02,004
You're right.

1857
01:17:02,005 --> 01:17:03,945
(They were colleagues for around 20 years.)

1858
01:17:05,005 --> 01:17:07,944
Do you happen to enjoy swimming?

1859
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:09,114
- Swimming?
- I'm just curious.

1860
01:17:09,115 --> 01:17:10,115
You didn't bring your swimwear?

1861
01:17:11,285 --> 01:17:12,955
I was supposed to bring my swimwear?

1862
01:17:13,485 --> 01:17:15,784
- I see.
- Do you dislike swimming?

1863
01:17:15,785 --> 01:17:17,883
- It's not something that I dislike, - He swims too.

1864
01:17:17,884 --> 01:17:20,354
But do us four really have to swim together?

1865
01:17:22,224 --> 01:17:23,423
He doesn't want to swim with us.

1866
01:17:23,424 --> 01:17:25,763
He enjoys swimming, but he doesn't want to do it with us.

1867
01:17:25,764 --> 01:17:28,394
Why go in the water? Is it with a swim tube?

1868
01:17:29,134 --> 01:17:30,633
These two and Dex went swimming at the beach.

1869
01:17:30,634 --> 01:17:32,174
- Really?
- Yes.

1870
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:35,304
- I was on a swim tube.
- I must have a swim tube.

1871
01:17:35,445 --> 01:17:37,304
- Do you? Let's get on them then.
- Of course.

1872
01:17:37,974 --> 01:17:40,974
(He's going to be on a swim tube too.)

1873
01:17:42,415 --> 01:17:43,513
I see.

1874
01:17:43,514 --> 01:17:44,514
Out of these ingredients,

1875
01:17:45,585 --> 01:17:48,755
what would you choose to collect?

1876
01:17:50,054 --> 01:17:51,084
Out of experience,

1877
01:17:51,085 --> 01:17:53,695
the main ingredients always get collected.

1878
01:17:53,995 --> 01:17:56,124
It'll be over with just the fishing.

1879
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:57,365
(It'll be over with just the fishing.)

1880
01:17:58,495 --> 01:17:59,894
We'll have to go out to the sea.

1881
01:18:00,564 --> 01:18:04,034
Imagine the scene of us having to lift the pike eels up.

1882
01:18:04,035 --> 01:18:07,673
The eels wrap around our faces.

1883
01:18:07,674 --> 01:18:08,804
(She covers her eyes.)

1884
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:11,604
The eels are all over the place.

1885
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:13,673
- That would be an amazing scene.
- Right.

1886
01:18:13,674 --> 01:18:15,144
(That sounds exciting.)

1887
01:18:15,745 --> 01:18:16,915
Does this show...

1888
01:18:17,514 --> 01:18:19,585
usually feed you in the morning?

1889
01:18:19,684 --> 01:18:20,914
- Yes.
- Yes.

1890
01:18:20,915 --> 01:18:22,584
They feed you a lot of good food.

1891
01:18:22,585 --> 01:18:24,955
- You can't skip this meal.
- You have to eat a lot.

1892
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:30,063
This is the most comfortable time of the day.

1893
01:18:30,064 --> 01:18:31,893
- Right.
- You actually know it all, right?

1894
01:18:31,894 --> 01:18:32,964
You have to eat when food is given to you.

1895
01:18:33,665 --> 01:18:34,695
And now,

1896
01:18:35,735 --> 01:18:37,335
all we have left is to suffer under the heat.

1897
01:18:40,104 --> 01:18:41,104
I can't agree more.

1898
01:18:42,505 --> 01:18:43,745
This will be the coolest place throughout the day.

1899
01:18:46,644 --> 01:18:47,673
Did you enjoy your meal?

1900
01:18:47,674 --> 01:18:48,684
(Did you enjoy your meal?)

1901
01:18:50,045 --> 01:18:51,915
- I suddenly want to eat more.
- We're leaving already?

1902
01:18:52,314 --> 01:18:54,713
The pike eel you just had...

1903
01:18:54,714 --> 01:18:57,684
is known as the representative dish for stamina in the summer.

1904
01:18:58,524 --> 01:18:59,524
We must be going to catch them.

1905
01:19:00,894 --> 01:19:02,494
The pike eels are caught...

1906
01:19:02,495 --> 01:19:05,633
from the morning to lunchtime.

1907
01:19:05,634 --> 01:19:07,164
- They are caught during that time?
- There will be 2 teams of 2...

1908
01:19:07,165 --> 01:19:10,034
for the fishing work.

1909
01:19:10,035 --> 01:19:12,005
- Is everything settled?
- Hold on.

1910
01:19:12,634 --> 01:19:13,634
What was that?

1911
01:19:14,474 --> 01:19:15,844
It isn't done in the morning?

1912
01:19:16,144 --> 01:19:18,474
During lunchtime. So we can go at this time.

1913
01:19:19,445 --> 01:19:21,013
It will done in 2 groups of 2.

1914
01:19:21,014 --> 01:19:22,285
(It will done in 2 groups of 2.)

1915
01:19:22,415 --> 01:19:24,383
The Pogyo Village you are currently at...

1916
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:27,814
is known as the area with the most pike eels.

1917
01:19:29,924 --> 01:19:32,654
So you will be catching pike eels at this place.

1918
01:19:32,655 --> 01:19:34,624
- Oh, no!
- What do we do?

1919
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:35,923
- What do we do?
- Gosh.

1920
01:19:35,924 --> 01:19:37,564
The pike eel fishing...

1921
01:19:37,795 --> 01:19:39,335
No!

1922
01:19:41,295 --> 01:19:42,963
(The pike eel fishing...)

1923
01:19:42,964 --> 01:19:43,964
will be done tomorrow.

1924
01:19:45,804 --> 01:19:46,874
- What?
- In 2 groups of 2?

1925
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:49,274
- You won't be doing it.
- I see.

1926
01:19:50,304 --> 01:19:51,945
Then where are we going today?

1927
01:19:53,045 --> 01:19:54,513
You will be heading home first.

1928
01:19:54,514 --> 01:19:57,445
- Gosh. We're going home first.
- That must be it.

1929
01:19:57,814 --> 01:20:00,115
- It must be corn today.
- It's something easy for a change.

1930
01:20:00,214 --> 01:20:01,785
The pike eel fishing is tomorrow?

1931
01:20:02,884 --> 01:20:04,024
We should go today.

1932
01:20:05,024 --> 01:20:07,024
How does that sound? It can be done during lunchtime anyway.

1933
01:20:07,255 --> 01:20:08,694
We'll be going anyway.

1934
01:20:08,695 --> 01:20:11,364
It will be exciting to go with Tae Hyun...

1935
01:20:11,365 --> 01:20:13,464
and hang out with the eels.

1936
01:20:15,295 --> 01:20:17,735
It will be really exciting to go with Tae Hyun.

1937
01:20:19,274 --> 01:20:21,005
(Staring)

1938
01:20:21,434 --> 01:20:23,174
Why are you looking at me like that?

1939
01:20:26,674 --> 01:20:28,144
You should stay for two days.

1940
01:20:28,884 --> 01:20:30,415
- You should stay for two days.
- I can't.

1941
01:20:31,344 --> 01:20:32,714
- Why not?
- I don't have more underwear.

1942
01:20:33,785 --> 01:20:36,085
- I'll get you some from the market.
- No.

1943
01:20:36,585 --> 01:20:38,923
You should do it while you're here.

1944
01:20:38,924 --> 01:20:41,093
- It's the joy of being together.
- My goodness.

1945
01:20:41,094 --> 01:20:42,165
(The joy of fishing together)

1946
01:20:42,264 --> 01:20:45,094
I'll leave as soon as I get up in the morning.

1947
01:20:46,195 --> 01:20:47,195
No.

1948
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:50,104
(Tae Hyun wasn't aware of this.)

1949
01:20:52,774 --> 01:20:55,133
Why didn't you do this from the start?

1950
01:20:55,134 --> 01:20:56,144
As soon as we got here.

1951
01:20:56,344 --> 01:20:58,505
(We have to do this for two days.)

1952
01:20:59,174 --> 01:21:00,545
(What is all this?)

1953
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,843
(Was everything planned?)

1954
01:21:02,844 --> 01:21:05,214
(Has everything gone wrong for Tae Hyun?)

1955
01:21:07,214 --> 01:21:11,284
(Tae Hyun's pitiful pike eel fishing experience)

1956
01:21:11,285 --> 01:21:12,354
Step on it!

1957
01:21:13,155 --> 01:21:16,394
(Cha Tae Hyun's Unexpected Pike Eel Fishing)

1958
01:21:21,165 --> 01:21:22,735
All right. It's this car.

1959
01:21:23,304 --> 01:21:25,405
(Today's driver is Tae Hyun.)

1960
01:21:25,705 --> 01:21:26,705
How long will it take?

1961
01:21:27,035 --> 01:21:29,905
- It says it will take 25 minutes.
- It's quite far away.

1962
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:33,513
- You have to connect it, right?
- Yes. I was looking at it.

1963
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,984
- Connect what?
- Eun Jin...

1964
01:21:35,985 --> 01:21:37,544
- is our DJ.
- I'm in charge of music.

1965
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:39,013
(DJ Ahn gets to work even today.)

1966
01:21:39,014 --> 01:21:40,683
- I see.
- We all have our roles.

1967
01:21:40,684 --> 01:21:41,684
Where? Media?

1968
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:43,984
Gosh. You have all of it downloaded?

1969
01:21:43,985 --> 01:21:45,255
(Bluetooth connected)

1970
01:21:45,995 --> 01:21:47,754
All right. Let's get going now.

1971
01:21:47,755 --> 01:21:48,755
- I'll get us moving now.
- Okay.

1972
01:21:48,756 --> 01:21:51,195
(They head home with "Again To Me" by Tae Hyun.)

1973
01:21:52,335 --> 01:21:55,393
- My goodness!
- Gosh. It's so pretty.

1974
01:21:55,394 --> 01:21:57,204
The road must be right in front of the sea.

1975
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:58,235
Goodness.

1976
01:21:58,665 --> 01:22:01,075
Gosh, it's so nice here.

1977
01:22:03,205 --> 01:22:06,614
That must be a yacht sailing.

1978
01:22:06,615 --> 01:22:07,714
(Across the coastal road)

1979
01:22:10,085 --> 01:22:11,584
It's so laidback since we don't have to...

1980
01:22:11,585 --> 01:22:13,084
- work right away.
- Right.

1981
01:22:13,085 --> 01:22:14,115
(They enjoy their way home while feeling relaxed.)

1982
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:18,524
It must be corn, right, Jung Ah?

1983
01:22:18,854 --> 01:22:20,254
- I think it will be corn.
- It seems like it.

1984
01:22:20,255 --> 01:22:22,694
- It's a place near home.
- Right.

1985
01:22:22,695 --> 01:22:25,995
We were told to go home, so we might be able to walk there.

1986
01:22:27,535 --> 01:22:31,405
(Is the ingredient in season they have to collect really corn?)

1987
01:22:32,634 --> 01:22:34,133
(Let's think about work later.)

1988
01:22:34,134 --> 01:22:35,134
(Looking)

1989
01:22:35,474 --> 01:22:36,973
- Eun Jin.
- Yes?

1990
01:22:36,974 --> 01:22:38,705
- Bring up the excitement.
- Okay.

1991
01:22:38,774 --> 01:22:40,445
(Looking determined)

1992
01:22:41,144 --> 01:22:42,985
(What is DJ Ahn's song of choice?)

1993
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:46,115
Are you playing all of my songs?

1994
01:22:46,384 --> 01:22:48,485
Yes. It's a medley of your songs.

1995
01:22:48,955 --> 01:22:52,054
(I'm starting to get excited now.)

1996
01:22:52,755 --> 01:22:55,625
(Dancing)

1997
01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:58,523
This was when Jo Sung Mo's "I Swear..."

1998
01:22:58,524 --> 01:23:00,134
- was around, right.
- Yes.

1999
01:23:02,035 --> 01:23:04,304
The song is exciting, but the lyrics are depressing.

2000
01:23:05,165 --> 01:23:06,933
- They're not exciting lyrics.
- This generation...

2001
01:23:06,934 --> 01:23:10,004
was when people felt agony for love.

2002
01:23:10,005 --> 01:23:11,045
(Chuckling)

2003
01:23:11,505 --> 01:23:13,745
I love songs from this generation because they are so desperate.

2004
01:23:14,415 --> 01:23:16,344
- Desperate love.
- This was what was hilarious.

2005
01:23:16,714 --> 01:23:17,714
When I sang the song,

2006
01:23:18,384 --> 01:23:20,085
I had to smile while singing because it was dance music.

2007
01:23:20,755 --> 01:23:21,915
- But the lyrics...
- But the lyrics...

2008
01:23:22,325 --> 01:23:23,353
The lyrics were ridiculous.

2009
01:23:23,354 --> 01:23:25,155
A song about being dumped by someone.

2010
01:23:25,755 --> 01:23:29,295
(My love, my pain)

2011
01:23:29,394 --> 01:23:32,594
(They aren't important to you)

2012
01:23:32,795 --> 01:23:35,735
Those lyrics were sung with a smile.

2013
01:23:36,134 --> 01:23:39,774
(Sad lyrics with silly movements)

2014
01:23:41,075 --> 01:23:44,174
(The owner of the song feels proud.)

2015
01:23:46,115 --> 01:23:49,184
(Along with the medley of Tae Hyun's songs, )

2016
01:23:51,545 --> 01:23:55,924
(they arrive at the entrance of the village they will stay in.)

2017
01:23:58,155 --> 01:23:59,195
Are we here now?

2018
01:24:00,295 --> 01:24:01,795
I feel like this place is...

2019
01:24:02,424 --> 01:24:03,964
- Our neighborhood?
- I think it is.

2020
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:06,534
- This must be it.
- It's our village.

2021
01:24:06,535 --> 01:24:08,063
It's so pretty.

2022
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,064
Garyong Village?

2023
01:24:09,065 --> 01:24:10,263
(This place gives a warm welcome to the siblings.)

2024
01:24:10,264 --> 01:24:11,264
This must be it.

2025
01:24:11,265 --> 01:24:14,335
(The emerald sea is surrounding Garyong Village.)

2026
01:24:15,774 --> 01:24:18,575
(The mountains are surrounding the village like folding screens.)

2027
01:24:20,144 --> 01:24:23,684
(The sea offers itself to become a living place for the residents.)

2028
01:24:29,384 --> 01:24:32,184
(They are gathered together in this area, )

2029
01:24:33,695 --> 01:24:39,394
(and they live while taking care of the sea.)

2030
01:24:39,634 --> 01:24:40,634
(Garyong Saemaeul Hall)

2031
01:24:40,635 --> 01:24:43,665
(In the small and warm village by the sea, )

2032
01:24:44,905 --> 01:24:48,804
(they plan to stay a while.)

2033
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:53,474
(Nice to meet you, Fresh Off the Sea.)

2034
01:24:54,844 --> 01:24:56,384
We're here.

2035
01:24:56,615 --> 01:24:58,013
Let's take our luggage with us.

2036
01:24:58,014 --> 01:24:59,014
Okay.

2037
01:24:59,714 --> 01:25:00,984
Since Dex isn't here,

2038
01:25:00,985 --> 01:25:02,354
- I'll do my best.
- We have to...

2039
01:25:02,455 --> 01:25:03,654
(Speaking of which)

2040
01:25:03,655 --> 01:25:04,825
You can count on me.

2041
01:25:05,724 --> 01:25:08,155
(On their first day in Namhae)

2042
01:25:09,165 --> 01:25:10,994
- Can you unload everything?
- Of course.

2043
01:25:10,995 --> 01:25:12,795
(He took out all their luggage for them.)

2044
01:25:13,865 --> 01:25:14,865
(On their first day in Yeongdeok)

2045
01:25:14,866 --> 01:25:16,335
I think we have to go inside.

2046
01:25:16,564 --> 01:25:17,734
- Drag them on the wheels?
- Yes.

2047
01:25:17,735 --> 01:25:19,103
(The youngest took on all the work that required strength.)

2048
01:25:19,104 --> 01:25:21,634
- Is that small one ours?
- Yes.

2049
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,544
(However, the youngest isn't here today.)

2050
01:25:23,545 --> 01:25:24,804
This is unbelievable.

2051
01:25:25,974 --> 01:25:27,014
I'll take them out.

2052
01:25:27,814 --> 01:25:29,183
- I'll do my best.
- We have to...

2053
01:25:29,184 --> 01:25:30,584
(The temporary youngest Eun Jin takes action.)

2054
01:25:30,585 --> 01:25:32,184
You can count on me. What?

2055
01:25:32,755 --> 01:25:34,714
Jung Ah, it's heavy.

2056
01:25:34,814 --> 01:25:36,024
- I'll take it out.
- It's...

2057
01:25:37,485 --> 01:25:38,853
What's this?

2058
01:25:38,854 --> 01:25:40,295
- How does it work?
- Shouldn't we open it?

2059
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:43,625
Actually, I don't know how it works.

2060
01:25:44,224 --> 01:25:47,365
We should probably take it off.

2061
01:25:47,865 --> 01:25:48,934
Let's just take out the luggage.

2062
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:51,035
Can you pull it out?

2063
01:25:51,264 --> 01:25:52,603
We should do it together today.

2064
01:25:52,604 --> 01:25:54,875
(They decide to pull out the luggage instead of opening the lid.)

2065
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,075
Is this all your luggage?

2066
01:25:57,575 --> 01:25:59,213
- I got it. Leave it to me.
- You got it?

2067
01:25:59,214 --> 01:26:00,214
(They finish unloading the car together.)

2068
01:26:00,344 --> 01:26:01,344
That's all.

2069
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:02,884
That's all. Let's go.

2070
01:26:04,245 --> 01:26:07,014
(While humming, they head to the house where they'll be staying.)

2071
01:26:09,155 --> 01:26:12,324
What? The cornfield is right here.

2072
01:26:12,325 --> 01:26:13,924
It must be corn.

2073
01:26:15,195 --> 01:26:19,894
(There's a cornfield by the street.)

2074
01:26:21,264 --> 01:26:22,264
Corn.

2075
01:26:24,634 --> 01:26:28,104
(When they follow the alley after passing the cornfield)

2076
01:26:29,705 --> 01:26:32,644
This must be our house because there are bicycles.

2077
01:26:32,844 --> 01:26:33,844
(They find the house where they'll be staying.)

2078
01:26:33,845 --> 01:26:35,745
- The mint-colored house.
- It's the mint-colored house.

2079
01:26:37,314 --> 01:26:39,454
Did you ride the back of that bicycle?

2080
01:26:39,455 --> 01:26:40,684
- Yes.
- It's our bicycle.

2081
01:26:41,554 --> 01:26:43,124
I'll give you a ride later.

2082
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:45,255
- What?
- I'll be the driver.

2083
01:26:46,554 --> 01:26:47,624
This is the house.

2084
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:48,923
(Fresh off the Sea reaches the house while chatting.)

2085
01:26:48,924 --> 01:26:51,264
(Eun Jin's background music is on.)

2086
01:26:52,764 --> 01:26:55,464
(This is the four siblings' home.)

2087
01:26:56,964 --> 01:26:59,973
(Blue like the emerald sea in Goseong)

2088
01:26:59,974 --> 01:27:01,835
(Over the blue wall)

2089
01:27:02,174 --> 01:27:04,844
(A charming redbrick house)

2090
01:27:05,575 --> 01:27:08,844
(The front yard that looks like the fine sandy beach)

2091
01:27:09,884 --> 01:27:12,485
(At a place that's full of the fishing village vibe)

2092
01:27:13,415 --> 01:27:17,224
(What kind of memory will the four siblings make?)

2093
01:27:17,924 --> 01:27:20,455
(Shall we go inside the redbrick house?)

2094
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:22,695
(Singing)

2095
01:27:23,165 --> 01:27:24,463
(Grunting)

2096
01:27:24,464 --> 01:27:26,593
I should carry it instead. Please wait.

2097
01:27:26,594 --> 01:27:29,035
(Welcome. Isn't it your first time seeing a yard made of gravel?)

2098
01:27:29,094 --> 01:27:31,604
I worked out before coming here.

2099
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:34,204
Gosh, that's impressive.

2100
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:37,244
(She lifts up her suitcase that's as big as her body.)

2101
01:27:37,245 --> 01:27:38,245
- This is...
- Gosh.

2102
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:42,244
(The elder sisters are also struggling.)

2103
01:27:42,245 --> 01:27:44,213
Carrying the suitcase isn't easy at all.

2104
01:27:44,214 --> 01:27:45,314
It's extremely hard.

2105
01:27:46,485 --> 01:27:49,723
(It's a gravel yard when Dex isn't with them.)

2106
01:27:49,724 --> 01:27:50,884
I'll put the suitcase...

2107
01:27:51,424 --> 01:27:54,454
- Clattering.
- Goodness.

2108
01:27:54,455 --> 01:27:55,553
(The youngest, I miss you especially today.)

2109
01:27:55,554 --> 01:27:56,825
The yard is huge.

2110
01:27:56,924 --> 01:27:58,995
Is this the problematic suitcase?

2111
01:27:59,264 --> 01:28:00,264
You mean, Jung Ah's suitcase?

2112
01:28:00,335 --> 01:28:02,564
- She brought a different one today.
- The problematic suitcase?

2113
01:28:03,464 --> 01:28:05,504
(Let's take a look around the house.)

2114
01:28:05,505 --> 01:28:06,505
- Gosh.
- Wait a minute.

2115
01:28:06,505 --> 01:28:07,505
Do we get separate rooms?

2116
01:28:07,506 --> 01:28:10,674
The three of us can stay here. Isn't this the living room?

2117
01:28:11,774 --> 01:28:13,445
- Here's another room.
- Is there?

2118
01:28:14,014 --> 01:28:16,745
- Is this another room?
- The layout is unusual.

2119
01:28:17,945 --> 01:28:20,155
Tae Hyun, this room is for you.

2120
01:28:21,155 --> 01:28:23,854
(After taking a look around the house, Jung Ah...)

2121
01:28:25,485 --> 01:28:28,223
(She opens the windows in the living room...)

2122
01:28:28,224 --> 01:28:30,394
(and gets ready to clean up.)

2123
01:28:31,295 --> 01:28:33,665
(After opening the windows wide, )

2124
01:28:34,335 --> 01:28:38,865
(she sets off with a broom.)

2125
01:28:39,774 --> 01:28:42,704
(Is Eun Jin wiping the floor already?)

2126
01:28:42,705 --> 01:28:44,774
Shall I go around and wipe the floor?

2127
01:28:46,174 --> 01:28:50,415
(Even her routine is getting similar to Jung Ah's.)

2128
01:28:52,085 --> 01:28:55,714
My parents would be very surprised to see me clean the room.

2129
01:28:56,224 --> 01:28:59,894
They wouldn't believe it because I'm always lying around.

2130
01:29:00,354 --> 01:29:01,955
- Our Eun Jin has changed.
- Yes.

2131
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:07,394
(She wipes Jung Ah's room clean.)

2132
01:29:07,995 --> 01:29:10,804
Shall I go around and wipe Tae Hyun's room?

2133
01:29:11,865 --> 01:29:13,104
Hello.

2134
01:29:13,575 --> 01:29:14,974
I'm here to wipe your room lightly.

2135
01:29:15,774 --> 01:29:17,444
You don't need to wipe in here.

2136
01:29:17,445 --> 01:29:19,204
I'll do it carelessly.

2137
01:29:19,205 --> 01:29:20,414
It's okay.

2138
01:29:20,415 --> 01:29:21,614
(She's exactly like Captain Yum.)

2139
01:29:21,615 --> 01:29:23,285
The staff already wiped it.

2140
01:29:24,214 --> 01:29:25,744
It's really hot.

2141
01:29:25,745 --> 01:29:27,214
(She finishes cleaning up the house.)

2142
01:29:29,955 --> 01:29:31,625
How can we work in today's weather?

2143
01:29:33,325 --> 01:29:35,024
It's really hot today.

2144
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:38,394
(The scorching sun welcomes Fresh off the Sea.)

2145
01:29:39,224 --> 01:29:42,093
(It's 12pm when the sun is the hottest.)

2146
01:29:42,094 --> 01:29:43,404
It's really hot today.

2147
01:29:43,405 --> 01:29:44,405
It's no joke.

2148
01:29:45,335 --> 01:29:48,735
(They take a break to avoid the heat wave.)

2149
01:29:50,005 --> 01:29:51,604
I'm so glad that Tae Hyun is with us today.

2150
01:29:52,144 --> 01:29:53,674
Seriously.

2151
01:29:54,915 --> 01:29:56,514
I hadn't even thought about pike eel.

2152
01:29:57,144 --> 01:29:59,014
Eel? It's pike eel.

2153
01:29:59,655 --> 01:30:01,784
Let's make shabu-shabu and grilled pike eel.

2154
01:30:01,785 --> 01:30:03,553
- Shabu-shabu?
- We'll make grilled pike eel...

2155
01:30:03,554 --> 01:30:05,125
with marinade.

2156
01:30:05,424 --> 01:30:06,695
Since we're catching pike eel tomorrow?

2157
01:30:07,495 --> 01:30:09,523
Once we finish work...

2158
01:30:09,524 --> 01:30:11,563
in the cornfield early...

2159
01:30:11,564 --> 01:30:12,834
Are you assuming that the ingredient is corn?

2160
01:30:12,835 --> 01:30:15,064
- Yes.
- Have we decided on corn?

2161
01:30:15,264 --> 01:30:17,103
- What if it isn't corn?
- What if it isn't corn?

2162
01:30:17,104 --> 01:30:18,205
What if it's broccoli instead?

2163
01:30:18,665 --> 01:30:19,774
If it's broccoli...

2164
01:30:20,134 --> 01:30:22,844
There isn't anything we can make with broccoli.

2165
01:30:23,945 --> 01:30:27,575
(It's time to harvest ingredients in season.)

2166
01:30:29,445 --> 01:30:30,713
Which arm sleeves do you want?

2167
01:30:30,714 --> 01:30:31,714
Whichever.

2168
01:30:31,814 --> 01:30:33,314
- Whichever.
- Pick what you want.

2169
01:30:33,415 --> 01:30:34,485
I'll take these.

2170
01:30:35,615 --> 01:30:38,184
(Junior Jung Ah, Eun Jin...)

2171
01:30:39,224 --> 01:30:41,424
This heat is out of this world.

2172
01:30:41,524 --> 01:30:44,165
(She prepares iced water for the family.)

2173
01:30:44,464 --> 01:30:46,133
Gosh, let's go.

2174
01:30:46,134 --> 01:30:48,035
(Shall we go to work now?)

2175
01:30:51,134 --> 01:30:53,375
My gosh, the weather is incredible.

2176
01:30:54,335 --> 01:30:55,335
- Seriously.
- Goodness.

2177
01:30:55,974 --> 01:30:57,804
I can't get used to this heat.

2178
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:00,075
- It's hot on my buttocks.
- I definitely agree.

2179
01:31:00,474 --> 01:31:03,914
The ingredient you'll harvest today...

2180
01:31:03,915 --> 01:31:05,713
in Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province is...

2181
01:31:05,714 --> 01:31:07,683
- corn.
- We already knew.

2182
01:31:07,684 --> 01:31:09,683
- The corn was so good.
- We know.

2183
01:31:09,684 --> 01:31:10,924
I had a hunch about it.

2184
01:31:12,255 --> 01:31:15,854
(The first ingredient in Goseong is corn.)

2185
01:31:16,865 --> 01:31:20,795
(Goseong corn is in season.)

2186
01:31:22,035 --> 01:31:25,434
Goseong corn is very chewy and delicious.

2187
01:31:27,274 --> 01:31:31,644
(Why is Goseong corn chewier than other types of corn?)

2188
01:31:32,774 --> 01:31:35,615
There's a lot of sea breeze, so it helps the corn grow.

2189
01:31:35,945 --> 01:31:37,214
It grows nice and big.

2190
01:31:39,455 --> 01:31:43,255
(The cob is full of firm and chewy kernels.)

2191
01:31:44,785 --> 01:31:46,723
It's delicious and sweet.

2192
01:31:46,724 --> 01:31:49,695
(Its chewy, sweet, and savory taste is excellent.)

2193
01:31:53,365 --> 01:31:57,634
(Today's local ingredient: Chewy, sweet, and savory corn)

2194
01:31:57,964 --> 01:31:58,964
Let's go.

2195
01:31:59,165 --> 01:32:00,874
- Let's get going.
- Let's get going.

2196
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:01,875
Let's go.

2197
01:32:02,174 --> 01:32:05,174
Let's go and make money.

2198
01:32:07,214 --> 01:32:09,143
This won't work. We need something uplifting.

2199
01:32:09,144 --> 01:32:10,383
What kind of song would you like?

2200
01:32:10,384 --> 01:32:12,143
- Wait, let me take a look.
- Not ballad songs.

2201
01:32:12,144 --> 01:32:13,155
(Play something refreshing.)

2202
01:32:13,485 --> 01:32:16,755
(Which song will Eun Jin pick to get rid of the heat wave?)

2203
01:32:17,155 --> 01:32:19,955
It's one of the songs you must sing after a breakup.

2204
01:32:20,495 --> 01:32:21,694
Picked by "Forbes."

2205
01:32:21,695 --> 01:32:24,764
(A song to sing after a breakup that's picked by "Forbes")

2206
01:32:24,865 --> 01:32:26,835
(She gets into it.)

2207
01:32:26,934 --> 01:32:29,534
(Wearing clothes that I bought you)

2208
01:32:29,535 --> 01:32:31,004
"Wearing clothes that I bought you?"

2209
01:32:31,005 --> 01:32:33,634
(Wearing perfume that I bought you)

2210
01:32:33,835 --> 01:32:35,205
Why did she buy him so much?

2211
01:32:35,934 --> 01:32:37,875
(By now, you must be with her)

2212
01:32:38,545 --> 01:32:39,744
- Do you mean the woman?
- Yes.

2213
01:32:39,745 --> 01:32:41,274
(You must be smiling again)

2214
01:32:41,445 --> 01:32:43,384
While wearing clothes that she bought him,

2215
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:45,013
- he's meeting another woman.
- He's meeting someone else.

2216
01:32:45,014 --> 01:32:46,014
(Resentment)

2217
01:32:46,214 --> 01:32:47,514
Why did he even put on the perfume?

2218
01:32:48,915 --> 01:32:52,585
(Although my tears keep falling)

2219
01:32:52,825 --> 01:32:54,255
(Let's go.)

2220
01:32:54,354 --> 01:32:57,625
(I'll show you how I changed completely)

2221
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:01,365
(The woman who's determined to take revenge)

2222
01:33:01,464 --> 01:33:03,865
(Yes, that's it.)

2223
01:33:04,064 --> 01:33:06,133
(Because of you who left)

2224
01:33:06,134 --> 01:33:07,735
(I won't cry)

2225
01:33:07,835 --> 01:33:08,835
(Singing)

2226
01:33:09,505 --> 01:33:11,505
I can't sing without this part.

2227
01:33:12,205 --> 01:33:13,274
(Grunting and growling)

2228
01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:17,144
You have a strong singing style.

2229
01:33:18,485 --> 01:33:19,584
It's quite strong.

2230
01:33:19,585 --> 01:33:20,814
(She agrees.)

2231
01:33:21,184 --> 01:33:22,655
(Laughing)

2232
01:33:23,024 --> 01:33:25,383
(I won't cry anymore.)

2233
01:33:25,384 --> 01:33:26,593
That was great.

2234
01:33:26,594 --> 01:33:27,923
(Singing)

2235
01:33:27,924 --> 01:33:29,023
Ailee made it through.

2236
01:33:29,024 --> 01:33:31,524
- Good.
- She overcame everything.

2237
01:33:32,325 --> 01:33:34,634
We'll arrive at 2:31pm. We're almost there.

2238
01:33:34,835 --> 01:33:35,934
- We have three minutes left.
- Okay.

2239
01:33:36,535 --> 01:33:39,934
(She changes her attitude and gets ready for labor work.)

2240
01:33:40,205 --> 01:33:41,205
(Slightly nervous)

2241
01:33:41,206 --> 01:33:43,545
The corn is a little...

2242
01:33:44,505 --> 01:33:45,505
Right.

2243
01:33:45,506 --> 01:33:47,245
(The destination is nearby.)

2244
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:50,383
- Doesn't it taste good?
- Where are we?

2245
01:33:50,384 --> 01:33:51,485
It smells good, but...

2246
01:33:53,255 --> 01:33:55,255
I can't believe that there's a road here.

2247
01:33:58,184 --> 01:34:00,024
(They get out of the main road.)

2248
01:34:00,195 --> 01:34:03,394
(The four of them get on a narrow street.)

2249
01:34:05,325 --> 01:34:06,334
(Gasp)

2250
01:34:06,335 --> 01:34:08,495
This is the cornfield. It's all cornfield.

2251
01:34:09,094 --> 01:34:11,104
There's too much corn. It's a bit...

2252
01:34:11,564 --> 01:34:14,534
Gosh, it looks like a scene from "Interstellar."

2253
01:34:14,535 --> 01:34:15,535
(Is it a scene from "Interstellar?")

2254
01:34:16,005 --> 01:34:17,844
(When they get on the narrow street)

2255
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:21,915
(The cornfield appears.)

2256
01:34:22,575 --> 01:34:25,314
(Facing the sea)

2257
01:34:26,755 --> 01:34:30,125
(The cornfield spreads wide.)

2258
01:34:32,155 --> 01:34:37,424
(Either the corn has been picked or needs to be harvested.)

2259
01:34:40,295 --> 01:34:42,933
(They're overwhelmed by the vastness.)

2260
01:34:42,934 --> 01:34:45,205
- Gosh, Jung Ah.
- Jung Ah.

2261
01:34:45,304 --> 01:34:46,534
What's going on here?

2262
01:34:46,535 --> 01:34:48,103
We thought that picking corn was easy.

2263
01:34:48,104 --> 01:34:49,804
- What's going on here?
- This is...

2264
01:34:50,205 --> 01:34:51,874
We might get in trouble again.

2265
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:53,375
(Feeling disturbed)

2266
01:34:54,674 --> 01:34:56,075
- Stop, please.
- Stop.

2267
01:34:56,615 --> 01:34:57,814
Okay.

2268
01:34:58,014 --> 01:35:00,284
- Thank you for driving, Tae Hyun.
- Thank you.

2269
01:35:00,285 --> 01:35:02,014
- You're welcome.
- Thank you for driving.

2270
01:35:02,285 --> 01:35:03,884
Gosh, it's hot.

2271
01:35:05,024 --> 01:35:06,125
Which cornfield...

2272
01:35:06,755 --> 01:35:08,223
Please get on.

2273
01:35:08,224 --> 01:35:09,924
- Hello.
- Hello.

2274
01:35:10,064 --> 01:35:11,494
- Should we get on?
- Yes.

2275
01:35:11,495 --> 01:35:13,194
Oh, my. We're getting on a cultivator.

2276
01:35:13,195 --> 01:35:15,335
- Really? Hello, sir.
- Hello.

2277
01:35:15,594 --> 01:35:17,664
- Shall we get on?
- Yes, please.

2278
01:35:17,665 --> 01:35:19,705
- Gosh.
- Wait.

2279
01:35:20,604 --> 01:35:21,834
(Harvesting corn is unusual from the start.)

2280
01:35:21,835 --> 01:35:23,143
- Come this way.
- Are we riding this?

2281
01:35:23,144 --> 01:35:24,274
Jung Ah, sit down.

2282
01:35:24,575 --> 01:35:26,713
This is so amazing.

2283
01:35:26,714 --> 01:35:27,745
(Everyone gets on.)

2284
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,074
My goodness.

2285
01:35:29,075 --> 01:35:31,514
(Shall we go?)

2286
01:35:32,214 --> 01:35:33,713
This is so romantic.

2287
01:35:33,714 --> 01:35:34,714
(Fresh off the Sea's "Country Diaries")

2288
01:35:35,214 --> 01:35:36,284
Right?

2289
01:35:36,285 --> 01:35:37,285
(Feeling excited)

2290
01:35:38,184 --> 01:35:41,125
- Here we go.
- Hello.

2291
01:35:41,854 --> 01:35:43,365
My gosh.

2292
01:35:44,894 --> 01:35:46,024
It's fun right away.

2293
01:35:46,995 --> 01:35:48,034
Goodness.

2294
01:35:48,035 --> 01:35:49,764
We got on right away...

2295
01:35:49,865 --> 01:35:51,964
without complaining.

2296
01:35:53,005 --> 01:35:55,575
(Thanks to the elder's thoughtfulness, )

2297
01:35:56,035 --> 01:35:59,604
(they forget to worry about laboring in the sun.)

2298
01:36:00,314 --> 01:36:03,915
(They enjoy the ride on a cultivator.)

2299
01:36:04,115 --> 01:36:06,384
Let's go, Goseong.

2300
01:36:08,014 --> 01:36:10,484
It rattles a lot. This is my first time riding it.

2301
01:36:10,485 --> 01:36:12,424
- Me too.
- Really?

2302
01:36:13,394 --> 01:36:17,195
(The heat disappears immediately.)

2303
01:36:23,405 --> 01:36:24,704
Where did you find the gloves?

2304
01:36:24,705 --> 01:36:25,905
They're right here.

2305
01:36:27,075 --> 01:36:28,204
- Thank you.
- Take a pair each.

2306
01:36:28,205 --> 01:36:29,273
Take the gloves, Jung Ah.

2307
01:36:29,274 --> 01:36:30,505
(The sight of cotton gloves brings them back to reality.)

2308
01:36:31,445 --> 01:36:33,974
(Resolute)

2309
01:36:34,774 --> 01:36:36,013
Are we going in here?

2310
01:36:36,014 --> 01:36:37,184
(Entering the corner)

2311
01:36:37,314 --> 01:36:38,544
- Gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

2312
01:36:38,545 --> 01:36:40,713
We're really going in.

2313
01:36:40,714 --> 01:36:41,755
My goodness.

2314
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:44,383
We must be heading to that field.

2315
01:36:44,384 --> 01:36:45,424
Goodness.

2316
01:36:46,795 --> 01:36:50,394
(Charging toward the cornfield)

2317
01:36:50,564 --> 01:36:53,394
(Gaping)

2318
01:36:54,295 --> 01:36:55,995
They're working over there.

2319
01:36:56,165 --> 01:36:57,165
I see.

2320
01:36:57,304 --> 01:36:59,735
(When they get near the field, )

2321
01:36:59,974 --> 01:37:02,735
(the smile disappears from their faces.)

2322
01:37:03,075 --> 01:37:05,745
(Corn that we'll harvest today)

2323
01:37:07,745 --> 01:37:10,844
(Surface area that's hard to manage)

2324
01:37:11,245 --> 01:37:13,285
(As the corn is in season now, )

2325
01:37:14,115 --> 01:37:17,285
(the corn plants have grown tall.)

2326
01:37:19,024 --> 01:37:22,854
(The field is so thick that it's suffocating.)

2327
01:37:24,724 --> 01:37:27,394
(It's just like a jungle.)

2328
01:37:27,934 --> 01:37:31,535
(Welcome to the corn jungle.)

2329
01:37:32,134 --> 01:37:34,774
(Up close, it's more overwhelming than before.)

2330
01:37:35,134 --> 01:37:37,773
- Gosh.
- Hello.

2331
01:37:37,774 --> 01:37:38,844
Oh, my.

2332
01:37:40,174 --> 01:37:42,643
- Thank you for driving.
- Thank you, sir.

2333
01:37:42,644 --> 01:37:46,115
- Gosh, this is...
- This looks incredible.

2334
01:37:46,214 --> 01:37:47,284
Hello.

2335
01:37:47,285 --> 01:37:49,155
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

2336
01:37:49,684 --> 01:37:51,625
Shouldn't we put on our boots?

2337
01:37:51,955 --> 01:37:53,124
- Oh, right.
- No, it's okay.

2338
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,393
- We can handle this.
- Sure.

2339
01:37:54,394 --> 01:37:55,424
Is it okay?

2340
01:37:55,524 --> 01:37:57,364
We have to learn how it's done.

2341
01:37:57,365 --> 01:37:58,523
(Tae Hyun moves quickly.)

2342
01:37:58,524 --> 01:38:00,894
We have to learn from the workers.

2343
01:38:01,594 --> 01:38:02,963
- Take a sickle with you.
- This looks scary.

2344
01:38:02,964 --> 01:38:04,804
(They look more resolute today than usual.)

2345
01:38:05,104 --> 01:38:06,473
We have to use this carefully.

2346
01:38:06,474 --> 01:38:08,803
- We can't work close to each other.
- Right.

2347
01:38:08,804 --> 01:38:09,875
It's too dangerous.

2348
01:38:10,005 --> 01:38:12,004
- Come. I'll show you how.
- Okay.

2349
01:38:12,005 --> 01:38:15,045
(Let's learn how to harvest corn.)

2350
01:38:16,684 --> 01:38:18,213
(In the dense corn forest)

2351
01:38:18,214 --> 01:38:19,853
You have to distinguish between...

2352
01:38:19,854 --> 01:38:21,454
- Yes.
- corn that's ripe and unripe.

2353
01:38:21,455 --> 01:38:22,683
(They must pick ripe corn carefully.)

2354
01:38:22,684 --> 01:38:23,984
When the corn is ripe,

2355
01:38:23,985 --> 01:38:26,485
you'll see dark corn silk.

2356
01:38:26,594 --> 01:38:28,424
The corn is ripe when it's dry.

2357
01:38:28,894 --> 01:38:31,325
- When it's not so dry...
- Not so dry?

2358
01:38:31,795 --> 01:38:33,794
If the corn silk is white,

2359
01:38:33,795 --> 01:38:35,133
it means that the corn isn't ripe yet.

2360
01:38:35,134 --> 01:38:37,005
- When it's green?
- I see.

2361
01:38:38,064 --> 01:38:41,604
(You can distinguish them by the color of the corn silk.)

2362
01:38:42,205 --> 01:38:45,144
(After cutting off the ears that are ripe, )

2363
01:38:46,674 --> 01:38:50,844
(cut the rest of the plant and lay it down.)

2364
01:38:51,115 --> 01:38:53,813
Put the ears in here.

2365
01:38:53,814 --> 01:38:54,853
(Drop the ears of corn into the black basket.)

2366
01:38:54,854 --> 01:38:55,884
The moving basket.

2367
01:38:56,825 --> 01:38:58,784
Once the basket gets filled,

2368
01:38:58,785 --> 01:39:01,755
- pour them into the green basket.
- Okay.

2369
01:39:02,325 --> 01:39:04,423
It takes about...

2370
01:39:04,424 --> 01:39:06,695
100 ears of corn to fill up the green basket.

2371
01:39:08,695 --> 01:39:10,904
(Warning: It's bigger than it seems.)

2372
01:39:10,905 --> 01:39:13,504
You'll earn 40 dollars per green basket.

2373
01:39:13,505 --> 01:39:14,574
- Forty dollars?
- Yes.

2374
01:39:14,575 --> 01:39:15,905
(1 green basket equals 40 dollars.)

2375
01:39:16,005 --> 01:39:17,704
(It's an arbitrary amount without considering...)

2376
01:39:17,705 --> 01:39:19,445
(the cost of corn and actual wage.)

2377
01:39:19,644 --> 01:39:20,974
I'll work on this side.

2378
01:39:21,144 --> 01:39:22,213
- Okay.
- Got it.

2379
01:39:22,214 --> 01:39:23,883
(Each of them takes a spot and starts harvesting corn.)

2380
01:39:23,884 --> 01:39:27,314
Let's give it a try.

2381
01:39:28,415 --> 01:39:29,415
All right.

2382
01:39:29,416 --> 01:39:32,424
(How much will they harvest inside this jungle?)

2383
01:39:33,325 --> 01:39:34,694
This looks small.

2384
01:39:34,695 --> 01:39:35,795
(After checking ripe ears thoroughly)

2385
01:39:36,795 --> 01:39:38,523
(Bold and satisfying reaping)

2386
01:39:38,524 --> 01:39:41,035
You're quite good.

2387
01:39:44,005 --> 01:39:45,064
At once.

2388
01:39:48,335 --> 01:39:50,774
(1 cut, 1 ear of corn)

2389
01:39:51,144 --> 01:39:52,505
Am I this good at using the sickle?

2390
01:39:53,844 --> 01:39:56,684
(She gets rid of the remaining plant completely.)

2391
01:39:58,014 --> 01:40:01,785
(The standard of harvesting)

2392
01:40:01,915 --> 01:40:03,454
(Tae Hyun, on the other hand)

2393
01:40:03,455 --> 01:40:04,455
Common knowledge...

2394
01:40:05,655 --> 01:40:06,724
about corn.

2395
01:40:07,495 --> 01:40:10,764
When the corn silk is black, it means that it's ripe.

2396
01:40:11,365 --> 01:40:12,893
This is small, but...

2397
01:40:12,894 --> 01:40:13,994
(He keeps talking a lot even while reaping.)

2398
01:40:13,995 --> 01:40:15,535
But it's ripe inside.

2399
01:40:17,665 --> 01:40:19,064
(In awe)

2400
01:40:19,304 --> 01:40:20,534
This is where you find a bonanza of corn.

2401
01:40:20,535 --> 01:40:22,934
You can harvest all in this area.

2402
01:40:23,205 --> 01:40:24,673
It's where you find a bonanza of corn.

2403
01:40:24,674 --> 01:40:27,474
(The entire field is a bonanza of corn.)

2404
01:40:28,445 --> 01:40:30,384
Let's see.

2405
01:40:30,945 --> 01:40:32,915
(Let's reap it clean.)

2406
01:40:35,415 --> 01:40:38,183
There is only one ear of corn...

2407
01:40:38,184 --> 01:40:41,023
on this huge plant.

2408
01:40:41,024 --> 01:40:42,894
- Exactly.
- It's really funny.

2409
01:40:43,424 --> 01:40:46,424
I expected 2 or 3 ears.

2410
01:40:46,594 --> 01:40:47,594
No.

2411
01:40:48,165 --> 01:40:51,165
(The plant is tall, but there's only 1 fruit?)

2412
01:40:51,304 --> 01:40:53,604
- It's tall, but there's only one.
- Exactly.

2413
01:40:54,934 --> 01:40:56,133
Goodness.

2414
01:40:56,134 --> 01:40:57,774
(1 ear)

2415
01:40:58,945 --> 01:41:00,415
On this huge corn plant...

2416
01:41:00,644 --> 01:41:01,744
(There is really only one.)

2417
01:41:01,745 --> 01:41:03,643
The plant is so tall, but...

2418
01:41:03,644 --> 01:41:06,784
- Actually, corn is really precious.
- I know.

2419
01:41:06,785 --> 01:41:09,154
- I always ate it without thinking.
- We realize it every time.

2420
01:41:09,155 --> 01:41:10,353
Actually, corn is precious.

2421
01:41:10,354 --> 01:41:11,384
(They feel how precious crops are again today.)

2422
01:41:11,785 --> 01:41:15,995
(It takes 100 reaping to fill 1 green basket.)

2423
01:41:16,995 --> 01:41:18,063
My goodness.

2424
01:41:18,064 --> 01:41:20,165
(She finds a precious ear of corn.)

2425
01:41:20,865 --> 01:41:22,234
(Grunting)

2426
01:41:22,235 --> 01:41:24,034
- Eun Jin, it feels pleasant.
- I agree.

2427
01:41:24,035 --> 01:41:25,434
- It relieves stress.
- It's a little...

2428
01:41:26,335 --> 01:41:29,034
- You mean, simple labor?
- We're talking about reaping.

2429
01:41:29,035 --> 01:41:32,504
After talking about taking revenge, now that you mention...

2430
01:41:32,505 --> 01:41:34,843
- the sickle, it sounds scary.
- Right.

2431
01:41:34,844 --> 01:41:37,285
- Right?
- After singing that song.

2432
01:41:37,844 --> 01:41:40,853
(I'll show you how I changed completely)

2433
01:41:40,854 --> 01:41:42,554
While holding up a sickle?

2434
01:41:43,314 --> 01:41:44,984
At this rate, I don't have to show how I changed.

2435
01:41:44,985 --> 01:41:46,423
If I just show him how I reap,

2436
01:41:46,424 --> 01:41:48,195
- Right.
- my revenge will be successful.

2437
01:41:48,554 --> 01:41:51,294
I don't know who he is, but he'd better not treat you badly.

2438
01:41:51,295 --> 01:41:52,665
As soon as I catch him red-handed...

2439
01:41:53,594 --> 01:41:55,665
I love this.

2440
01:41:57,405 --> 01:42:00,674
I want to reap all of them.

2441
01:42:01,705 --> 01:42:02,875
(Thud)

2442
01:42:03,335 --> 01:42:04,774
(Pulling hard)

2443
01:42:05,045 --> 01:42:06,745
You know what these are?

2444
01:42:07,214 --> 01:42:08,944
These are my flaws...

2445
01:42:08,945 --> 01:42:10,843
that resulted in mistakes in the past.

2446
01:42:10,844 --> 01:42:12,484
I'm getting rid of them.

2447
01:42:12,485 --> 01:42:14,915
That's the work I'm doing.

2448
01:42:15,655 --> 01:42:18,184
I don't know what I'm saying exactly,

2449
01:42:19,155 --> 01:42:20,594
but I'm doing my best in life.

2450
01:42:20,795 --> 01:42:22,094
I'll work hard.

2451
01:42:23,354 --> 01:42:25,894
She's so positive.

2452
01:42:26,524 --> 01:42:27,594
Off you go.

2453
01:42:30,335 --> 01:42:32,764
(Started with a reflection on the past)

2454
01:42:33,774 --> 01:42:37,174
(Sickle dancing in a trance)

2455
01:42:40,045 --> 01:42:41,514
This is so much fun.

2456
01:42:42,115 --> 01:42:43,485
It relieves stress.

2457
01:42:43,884 --> 01:42:47,213
It relieves stress

2458
01:42:47,214 --> 01:42:48,285
(Before and after)

2459
01:42:48,455 --> 01:42:49,655
This is done.

2460
01:42:50,524 --> 01:42:52,085
Let's go.

2461
01:42:53,825 --> 01:42:55,795
Did Eun Jin finish already?

2462
01:42:57,064 --> 01:42:59,094
Gosh, that's impressive.

2463
01:42:59,865 --> 01:43:00,933
Didn't I harvest a lot?

2464
01:43:00,934 --> 01:43:02,664
- Gosh.
- You really did.

2465
01:43:02,665 --> 01:43:04,535
I think this work is perfect for me.

2466
01:43:04,934 --> 01:43:06,905
- Oh, in one go?
- Yes.

2467
01:43:07,405 --> 01:43:09,205
- That's good.
- Thank you.

2468
01:43:09,735 --> 01:43:11,474
- I'll bring another basket of corn.
- Okay.

2469
01:43:12,174 --> 01:43:13,545
Corn

2470
01:43:14,245 --> 01:43:15,674
Let's go to my field.

2471
01:43:17,184 --> 01:43:19,785
(Captain Yum also finished filling one basket.)

2472
01:43:21,384 --> 01:43:22,384
Goodness.

2473
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:25,354
Where do I go?

2474
01:43:26,054 --> 01:43:28,194
Nothing is ripe on this side.

2475
01:43:28,195 --> 01:43:29,325
(She leaves the area where she finished reaping.)

2476
01:43:31,894 --> 01:43:34,594
(She joins Eun Jin on the same row.)

2477
01:43:35,235 --> 01:43:37,905
(Her reaping resumes without a break.)

2478
01:43:38,064 --> 01:43:39,804
I worked out for today.

2479
01:43:40,405 --> 01:43:41,734
All right.

2480
01:43:41,735 --> 01:43:43,945
(Burning with motivation)

2481
01:43:44,945 --> 01:43:48,214
(While the eldest and the third are struggling, )

2482
01:43:49,774 --> 01:43:51,383
(Tae Hyun is also working in silence.)

2483
01:43:51,384 --> 01:43:52,415
Oh, yes.

2484
01:43:52,814 --> 01:43:53,883
Tap, tap.

2485
01:43:53,884 --> 01:43:56,115
(He isn't silent.)

2486
01:43:56,554 --> 01:43:59,155
(His basket is almost full too.)

2487
01:43:59,985 --> 01:44:02,795
Now I understand why many horror movies were filmed...

2488
01:44:03,054 --> 01:44:04,963
in cornfields.

2489
01:44:04,964 --> 01:44:06,423
No one would find out...

2490
01:44:06,424 --> 01:44:08,934
no matter what happens here.

2491
01:44:09,735 --> 01:44:11,365
No one would ever know.

2492
01:44:12,865 --> 01:44:14,905
(It looks beautiful from the outside, )

2493
01:44:16,974 --> 01:44:20,245
(but it's a dense forest inside.)

2494
01:44:22,214 --> 01:44:24,245
- Help me.
- What?

2495
01:44:24,915 --> 01:44:25,985
- Goodness.
- What?

2496
01:44:27,714 --> 01:44:30,755
(Did something happen to Jun Myun?)

2497
01:44:31,255 --> 01:44:33,424
- Help me.
- What's wrong?

2498
01:44:33,995 --> 01:44:35,124
- I thought I was bleeding.
- Goodness.

2499
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:36,423
- What?
- Gosh.

2500
01:44:36,424 --> 01:44:38,464
- It's nothing.
- You startled me.

2501
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:41,665
There was a smudge, and I thought that it was blood.

2502
01:44:42,295 --> 01:44:43,335
This...

2503
01:44:43,535 --> 01:44:45,234
Gosh.

2504
01:44:45,235 --> 01:44:46,664
You startled me.

2505
01:44:46,665 --> 01:44:47,673
(Her heart almost stopped.)

2506
01:44:47,674 --> 01:44:48,705
Please.

2507
01:44:50,505 --> 01:44:51,875
You have to be careful.

2508
01:44:53,875 --> 01:44:57,245
(There's another reason why cornfields are scary.)

2509
01:44:57,445 --> 01:44:58,644
The field is endless.

2510
01:45:05,224 --> 01:45:06,284
(It's extremely vast.)

2511
01:45:06,285 --> 01:45:08,755
Gosh, the cornfield...

2512
01:45:10,825 --> 01:45:14,495
(Under the burning sun, )

2513
01:45:16,064 --> 01:45:19,064
(she's getting exhausted quickly.)

2514
01:45:19,505 --> 01:45:22,134
(Drenched in sweat)

2515
01:45:22,634 --> 01:45:25,004
The weather was murderous.

2516
01:45:25,005 --> 01:45:28,245
It was the hottest ever. I couldn't believe how hot it was.

2517
01:45:29,445 --> 01:45:31,545
- I have no strength in my arms.
- Me neither.

2518
01:45:31,945 --> 01:45:32,985
They're shaking a little.

2519
01:45:35,184 --> 01:45:36,314
I agree.

2520
01:45:38,554 --> 01:45:41,524
(The conversation is lost.)

2521
01:45:43,125 --> 01:45:46,594
(Their reaping is getting more dull.)

2522
01:45:52,804 --> 01:45:56,474
(Will we be okay today?)

2523
01:45:58,974 --> 01:46:01,375
(Meanwhile, Tae Hyun filled one basket.)

2524
01:46:01,974 --> 01:46:04,785
(He moves them without a word.)

2525
01:46:05,545 --> 01:46:08,354
(Finished 2 green baskets)

2526
01:46:08,955 --> 01:46:11,584
(Remaining baskets)

2527
01:46:11,585 --> 01:46:13,184
Do we have to fill all those baskets?

2528
01:46:14,394 --> 01:46:16,295
(Thinking)

2529
01:46:16,625 --> 01:46:19,264
Should we just fill two entire baskets?

2530
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:21,295
No, we should work...

2531
01:46:22,064 --> 01:46:23,335
until one of us passes out.

2532
01:46:24,165 --> 01:46:25,365
Until one of us passes out.

2533
01:46:26,064 --> 01:46:27,634
(Passing out)

2534
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:28,905
(What?)

2535
01:46:29,134 --> 01:46:30,874
- Did you get it on camera?
- Could you do it one more time?

2536
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:32,045
Do it one more time.

2537
01:46:32,344 --> 01:46:34,075
(Sighing)

2538
01:46:34,344 --> 01:46:36,474
I can't even stand up. I have to pull myself up.

2539
01:46:39,445 --> 01:46:41,014
I don't feel...

2540
01:46:41,554 --> 01:46:43,184
Gyeon...

2541
01:46:44,384 --> 01:46:47,394
(She ends up passing out.)

2542
01:46:47,695 --> 01:46:49,494
Gosh, are you okay?

2543
01:46:49,495 --> 01:46:52,024
(The man drops everything and runs over to her.)

2544
01:46:52,695 --> 01:46:54,263
I can't do it anymore.

2545
01:46:54,264 --> 01:46:55,295
(This is all I can do.)

2546
01:46:55,665 --> 01:46:56,764
What's going on?

2547
01:46:57,964 --> 01:46:59,035
It's not ripe.

2548
01:46:59,804 --> 01:47:01,103
Did I work too fast?

2549
01:47:01,104 --> 01:47:02,835
(She's lost.)

2550
01:47:03,035 --> 01:47:04,473
I can't do it anymore.

2551
01:47:04,474 --> 01:47:05,474
(A melodrama that's hotter than this year's heat wave)

2552
01:47:05,475 --> 01:47:06,974
Is this all you reaped?

2553
01:47:07,575 --> 01:47:09,375
- I already did one.
- Really?

2554
01:47:10,415 --> 01:47:11,415
This is my second basket.

2555
01:47:12,285 --> 01:47:14,214
Usually, I stop working out...

2556
01:47:15,014 --> 01:47:18,085
right before sweating because I hate sweating.

2557
01:47:18,384 --> 01:47:20,924
The gloves are filled with sweat inside.

2558
01:47:21,755 --> 01:47:22,824
Gosh, seriously.

2559
01:47:22,825 --> 01:47:23,924
(In tatters)

2560
01:47:25,165 --> 01:47:27,024
Shall I go towards the inside?

2561
01:47:28,594 --> 01:47:31,165
- Gosh.
- You're doing well.

2562
01:47:31,535 --> 01:47:33,633
- Agent Ahn.
- Yes?

2563
01:47:33,634 --> 01:47:34,673
(Agent Ahn filled two baskets.)

2564
01:47:34,674 --> 01:47:35,774
You're doing well.

2565
01:47:36,375 --> 01:47:38,103
(Panting)

2566
01:47:38,104 --> 01:47:40,104
- Drink some water.
- Okay.

2567
01:47:42,314 --> 01:47:45,014
Come over here. Come on.

2568
01:47:46,245 --> 01:47:48,684
I can do it without any problem.

2569
01:47:49,755 --> 01:47:51,053
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2570
01:47:51,054 --> 01:47:52,883
(Jun Myun returned to life after filling one basket.)

2571
01:47:52,884 --> 01:47:53,894
We...

2572
01:47:55,195 --> 01:47:58,264
(Piled up)

2573
01:47:59,665 --> 01:48:01,134
(Exclaiming)

2574
01:48:01,434 --> 01:48:02,634
(Moaning)

2575
01:48:03,434 --> 01:48:04,734
My goodness.

2576
01:48:04,735 --> 01:48:07,934
(During 48 years as a grasshopper, this has never happened to her.)

2577
01:48:08,262 --> 01:48:10,732
(Work hard now that you had food.)

2578
01:48:11,203 --> 01:48:14,133
(The corn inferno isn't over yet.)

2579
01:48:14,803 --> 01:48:16,633
(Ears of corn get piled up.)

2580
01:48:16,972 --> 01:48:19,243
(They're working properly today.)

2581
01:48:19,503 --> 01:48:21,072
(It's time to eat food in season after hard work.)

2582
01:48:21,343 --> 01:48:24,783
(I'll add glutinous rice and kernels inside the chicken...)

2583
01:48:25,083 --> 01:48:26,182
(to make samgyetang.)

2584
01:48:26,543 --> 01:48:28,413
(Jung Ah's special expertise is revealed.)

2585
01:48:28,753 --> 01:48:31,022
(A combination of corn and samgyetang?)

2586
01:48:31,283 --> 01:48:34,293
(The perfect dinner that receives the best response)

2587
01:48:34,553 --> 01:48:36,623
(What kind of magic did Jung Ah use?)

2588
01:48:36,923 --> 01:48:40,333
(The first fishing in the sea on Fresh off the Sea)

2589
01:48:40,533 --> 01:48:42,163
(Sharp teeth)

2590
01:48:42,732 --> 01:48:44,703
(Overflowing vitality)

2591
01:48:44,932 --> 01:48:47,902
(Let's go to the sea to catch pike eel!)

2592
01:48:48,602 --> 01:48:51,803
(A match between the four siblings and pike eel)

2593
01:48:52,102 --> 01:48:54,743
(Shouting urgently?)

2594
01:48:55,312 --> 01:48:58,043
(The most difficult labor ever)

2595
01:48:58,512 --> 01:49:01,312
(Pandemonium)

2596
01:49:01,652 --> 01:49:03,413
(- Hurry and take out the needle. - I really can't touch it.)

2597
01:49:04,152 --> 01:49:07,623
(Is Eun Jin refusing to labor?)

2598
01:49:08,053 --> 01:49:10,963
(What happened during the four siblings' pike eel fishing?)

2599
