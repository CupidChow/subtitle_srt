1
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,371
(The fourth location for seasonal ingredients)

2
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:17,442
(Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province)

3
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:18,872
(Are my cheeks too red?)

4
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:21,882
(They're very dressed up today as usual.)

5
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:23,581
(And as usual, they're having seasonal dishes.)

6
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,581
(But unlike other restaurants, this server looks very rushed.)

7
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:28,880
(Tae Hyun!)

8
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:30,322
(A precious guest, Cha Tae Hyun, has come to Goseong.)

9
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:31,852
(Like the variety show expert he is, he has such big reactions.)

10
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,060
(Now that I'm in Goseong, the eels...)

11
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,091
(will wrap around me like this.)

12
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:35,622
(Actually, you'll be working with pike eels today...)

13
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:36,990
(As soon as he brings up eels, )

14
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:37,991
(they are told they'll be working with eels.)

15
00:00:38,332 --> 00:00:40,162
(I'll get going now.)

16
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,472
(What work will they do today?)

17
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:45,031
(A cultivator is waiting for the four siblings?)

18
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:46,802
(And just like that, they're taken somewhere...)

19
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:49,641
(Before their eyes open up...)

20
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:52,972
(a wide and vast cornfield.)

21
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,640
(In the endless cornfield, )

22
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:55,641
(they get more and more tired.)

23
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:57,012
(Tae Hyun...)

24
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:58,982
(Are you okay?)

25
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:00,982
(The seasonal produce work is really taking a toll...)

26
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,950
(Did you show that in slow motion? Someone recorded that, right?)

27
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,091
(Can you fall one more time...)

28
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:06,292
(Tae Hyun is so mischievous.)

29
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:08,622
(Extremely hot weather)

30
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:10,692
(And endless jungle of corn)

31
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,702
(Will the four siblings successfully finish their work?)

32
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:18,202
(It's not easy to fill a basket of corn.)

33
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,270
(Sighing)

34
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:22,702
(Grunting)

35
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:24,710
Oh, my goodness.

36
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:27,011
(This is a first in my 48 years as a grasshopper...)

37
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,581
Gosh, it's so hot.

38
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:30,651
(Hurriedly gulping down the water of life)

39
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:34,981
Should we eat some snacks while we're taking a break?

40
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:36,592
- What? - Snacks?

41
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,592
- Oh, my! - That would be great!

42
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:43,291
(A savior has appeared.)

43
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:45,562
- Come over here! - Jung Ah and Tae Hyun!

44
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,162
Jung Ah! We have snacks!

45
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:50,431
Come to eat snacks!

46
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:52,901
Snacks... I need to eat some.

47
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:56,341
Thank you for working so hard in this hot weather.

48
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:57,370
You've done a great job.

49
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:58,371
Thank you.

50
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,942
Have some refreshing corn water.

51
00:02:01,842 --> 00:02:04,850
- This is also made with corn... - Is it coffee?

52
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,451
- No. It's misugaru. - Misugaru.

53
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:08,251
Oh, my It's been so long...

54
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:09,722
- since I've had misugaru. - Seriously.

55
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,351
- Oh, my. - Misugaru.

56
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:13,491
We also have tomatoes.

57
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:15,761
- Gosh. - Thank you.

58
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:19,031
- Oh, my goodness. Where did you... - Have some of this too.

59
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:20,331
(These snacks will save us from the extreme heat.)

60
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:22,532
You're so impressive. Even on days like this...

61
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,271
Let's talk in the cool shade.

62
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:27,171
(Thank you for the snacks.)

63
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:29,502
- Corn silk tea. - This is really good too.

64
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,040
We made this ourselves.

65
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,741
This corn silk tea is so delicious.

66
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:36,181
- It is. - It tastes like honey.

67
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:37,351
(How can this taste like honey?)

68
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:40,950
(It completely quenched her thirst.)

69
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,682
Have another cup of cold water.

70
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:46,351
(That's what I'm talking about!)

71
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:49,691
(Jun Myun gulps down the iced misugaru in one go.)

72
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:51,491
Gosh. It's been about 100 years since I've had misugaru.

73
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:52,961
- Right. - In the misugaru,

74
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:56,201
- It's been a while. - we add corn.

75
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:57,731
- In the misugaru? - yes.

76
00:02:58,402 --> 00:02:59,501
Dried corn.

77
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:00,871
- And you blend it together. - And dry it and blend it.

78
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,342
- Yes. - I see.

79
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:04,312
That's why it's even savorier.

80
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:09,010
- Corn sulbbang. - Corn sulbbang.

81
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,411
- Have some bread. - It's sulbbang.

82
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:11,580
- Yes. - Is it cornbread?

83
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:12,981
Sulbbang?

84
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,751
Corn sulbbang.

85
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:16,320
(It's much savorier because it's made with corn powder.)

86
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,122
You can use every part of corn.

87
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,890
Gosh. You made all of this yourselves.

88
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:22,421
In the afternoons, we ship these out.

89
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,192
If we harvest in the morning, in the afternoon...

90
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:27,662
It's tasty.

91
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,301
(Chewy)

92
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:34,170
These snacks are the best. Oh, my goodness.

93
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,201
(The taste of midday snacks can't be compared to anything else.)

94
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:38,111
(Should I have a bite too?)

95
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,711
(But...)

96
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:40,781
Let me have some.

97
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:41,981
(The whole thing?)

98
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,111
You scared me there.

99
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,051
(Returning the rest)

100
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:48,521
- Come on. - You scared me.

101
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:49,522
I almost ate the whole thing.

102
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:51,622
(But she still has a handful of bread.)

103
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:53,622
- I thought it was a skit. - No.

104
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:56,320
Are they all cornfields down this street?

105
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,032
- All of them were cornfields. - Yes, the whole street.

106
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:00,161
They're all cornfields.

107
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:01,162
(Look at this guy. You're pretty tasty.)

108
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:02,531
(Proud)

109
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:03,901
You eat so well.

110
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:05,170
- Me? - You eat so well.

111
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,140
- When we turned into this street... - They're all cornfields.

112
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,171
Exactly. Yes.

113
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,972
Gosh. The tough ones were so hard.

114
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:13,311
- Oh, my! Jun Myun. - When I was working,

115
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:15,011
- I was using a sickle, - It's so nice and sweet.

116
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:16,880
And I kept poking the corn.

117
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,951
It's sweet, but not too sweet.

118
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,182
Do you see what I mean?

119
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:21,951
- Yes. - You're so funny.

120
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:24,521
- Oh, my goodness. - I'm already used to it.

121
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:26,421
- You're good. - This is so delicious.

122
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:28,490
We didn't know...

123
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,662
- Goseong was so famous for corn. - We didn't know.

124
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:32,532
Our customers do say...

125
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:35,961
Gangwon Province is famous for corn,

126
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:38,171
- but Goseong corn is great too. - It's so delicious.

127
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:40,671
Do you need to finish everything by August?

128
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:43,310
- Until the end of the month. - We can keep harvesting...

129
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,740
- This side... - until almost the end of the month.

130
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,740
More stalks ripen every day.

131
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:47,881
I see.

132
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:48,882
(Because of the corn ripening every day...)

133
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,451
So we come out here every day.

134
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:54,282
(They harvest corn every single day.)

135
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:57,092
How do you do that?

136
00:04:57,392 --> 00:05:00,391
- And you take care of the house. - Yes, I do.

137
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:01,761
(That's the minimum.)

138
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:03,961
- That's countryside life. - Right.

139
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:06,190
(We learn again what diligence means.)

140
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:07,201
You're so impressive.

141
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:08,901
You should eat lots of tasty things.

142
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:12,131
Seriously. You need to take good care of your health.

143
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:13,272
(Chatting made their break go by very quickly.)

144
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:15,141
- That was nice. - I have the energy to work now.

145
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:16,142
Totally.

146
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:17,142
(Now that they're about to go back to work, they remember...)

147
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:20,180
- Gosh. Our youngest... - I miss our youngest.

148
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:21,282
Should we give him a call?

149
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:22,712
Let's do a video call.

150
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:24,810
But you shouldn't be in it.

151
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:26,111
We should tell him that it's just the three of us.

152
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:30,022
(Lined up side by side)

153
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:32,892
Did he pick up?

154
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:36,790
- Hey! - Hey, you!

155
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,861
- Look at our faces! - Hey!

156
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:42,162
- Hey! - Goodness.

157
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,500
(He feels bad now that he can see their faces.)

158
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,972
- When are you coming back? - We're in a cornfield!

159
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:49,300
(Laughing)

160
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:50,971
- We're so tired! - Right!

161
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:53,240
- What is this? Where are you? - Seriously.

162
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:55,581
Why are you... Why is your face so pale?

163
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:57,810
- Seriously. He looks pretty. - I'm so disappointed.

164
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:59,181
I have makeup on.

165
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:02,081
- I'm so disappointed. - Hey.

166
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:03,821
I'm sorry. I'll hurry over...

167
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,161
and work hard so we can make a delicious dinner this evening.

168
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,561
What?

169
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:11,091
- Is he talking for the camera? - Yes.

170
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:12,531
- Why are you being so... - What are you going to do?

171
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:14,031
I'm so disappointed.

172
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:16,500
You sound like you're giving an interview for TV...

173
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,531
even though you're just calling us.

174
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:19,670
(Unsure what to say)

175
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,701
What did you say?

176
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:21,772
(The connection is suddenly unstable.)

177
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,610
- It's because he's feeling shy. - Anyway, we miss you.

178
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:24,641
- Hurry over. - We miss you.

179
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:26,571
- Hurry over. - I'll be there soon.

180
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:27,642
Bye!

181
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,342
- Bye! - See you later.

182
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,582
It must be so tough for Dex.

183
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:36,222
(Dex has a lot to deal with.)

184
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:37,790
(Did you have to point that out?)

185
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,251
(Read the room.)

186
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:41,892
- We don't let him be. - Because he's the youngest.

187
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,790
- Let's get up. - Let's work.

188
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,831
(It's time to work again.)

189
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:47,301
- Should we do one more basket? - Okay.

190
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:52,101
Okay. Go. Let's do some work.

191
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:55,142
Gosh. This one...

192
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:57,310
This one is so big.

193
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:58,811
(They've become talkative again.)

194
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:01,712
Now that I've eaten, I have to use my power.

195
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:04,782
I feel energized after eating those snacks.

196
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:06,681
How funny.

197
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:10,322
I can cut it off with one swing of the sickle.

198
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:16,121
(After working hard harvesting corn...)

199
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:19,592
Gosh. You're so impressive.

200
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:23,401
You emptied this part of the field.

201
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,572
Yes, I did.

202
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,402
Should we go for five more minutes?

203
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:27,402
- Five more minutes? - Yes.

204
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:32,541
(More, more, and more)

205
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:34,110
(Just a little bit more)

206
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:36,911
Gosh. You harvested a lot.

207
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:39,050
(Only after she plowed a road through the field...)

208
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,751
Is that enough? I think this is enough.

209
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:42,350
- Okay. Should we get going? - Yes.

210
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:43,351
(Okay. I'll let you go...)

211
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:44,421
Okay.

212
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:47,921
(Using every last bit of energy until the end)

213
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:51,462
Oh, I'm dizzy. Oh, my.

214
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:54,132
Oh, goodness. Okay.

215
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:58,031
- Done! - Done.

216
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:59,032
(Corn harvest is done.)

217
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,272
- Yes! - It's totally full!

218
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:02,100
Good.

219
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,610
- Let's sit again. - We need to sit.

220
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:04,711
I'm so tired.

221
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:05,712
(We... We need to sit...)

222
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:10,181
Please blow, wind.

223
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:14,882
Tae Hyun. Are you okay?

224
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:17,290
Do you already want to go home?

225
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,651
He wanted to go home ever since the morning.

226
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:20,961
I've made up my mind.

227
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:21,962
In what way?

228
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:23,291
To leave tomorrow morning?

229
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:24,961
To escape tonight.

230
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,490
(To escape tonight.)

231
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:27,930
Aren't you going to catch eels tomorrow?

232
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:28,961
We have to go together.

233
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:30,301
- We're a team. - Oh, eels...

234
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:31,832
What are you talking about?

235
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:32,870
(Let's wait and see.)

236
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:33,971
Good job...

237
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,670
- working in the extreme heat. - Oh, goodness.

238
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:38,940
Here is the money for the corn you harvested today.

239
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:40,071
- Gosh. - Thank you.

240
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:41,082
- Yes! - Yes!

241
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:44,211
We got 40 dollars for 1 box?

242
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:46,782
Isn't 40 dollars quite a lot?

243
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:48,551
We did a lot of work today.

244
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:51,522
I think we have some luxuries after working hard.

245
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,091
Four, five, six, seven.

246
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:56,122
- I just got here. - Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

247
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:58,732
- Sixteen. - Oh, my.

248
00:08:58,931 --> 00:08:59,991
- We made 160 dollars. - Oh, my.

249
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:01,001
(160 dollars for 4 baskets at 40 dollars each)

250
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,831
(They made a lot of money.)

251
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,671
- She has something for you. - Oh, my.

252
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:06,371
- Here you go. - Oh, my.

253
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:07,501
Thank you for working so hard...

254
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:08,601
- picking corn. - Thank you!

255
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:10,512
- You're giving us so much. - Oh, my.

256
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:13,070
- Take these and enjoy them steamed. - Oh, my!

257
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:14,741
- This is so much. - Oh, my goodness.

258
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:16,241
- This is so much. - Yes.

259
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:17,511
(She gave them four whole sacks.)

260
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:19,011
- Thank you. - Goodness.

261
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:21,450
Thank you for working so hard on a hot day like this.

262
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:23,522
Thank you so much for everything.

263
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:26,351
- Thank you! - Thank you!

264
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:27,521
Thank you for your work.

265
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:28,992
- Thank you! - Thank you!

266
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,330
All right!

267
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:32,732
- We're taking off. - Okay!

268
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:35,531
- Thank you for your work. - Thank you.

269
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:37,470
- Bye! - Bye!

270
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:40,502
- Be healthy. Stay strong! - Be healthy and stay strong!

271
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:44,070
- Gosh, I feel kind of... Bye! - Oh, my.

272
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,311
Working hard like this makes me feel proud.

273
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:48,012
That was insane.

274
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:50,951
- Wait. Jun Myun's hands... - Yes?

275
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:53,181
They look like such baby hands.

276
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,051
They look like such baby hands.

277
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,151
- They're very high maintenance. - That's why...

278
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:58,852
That's why I told her I wanted to buy her a first birthday ring.

279
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:01,761
- You should. - That's what I meant.

280
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:04,330
- They look 100 days old. - You're right.

281
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:05,661
(Happily laughing together)

282
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:06,830
Back in Seoul,

283
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:08,800
- life is full of worries. - Right.

284
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:11,401
- Right. We can be carefree here. - Exactly. We can be carefree

285
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,642
- when we're here. - Right.

286
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,340
(We're leaving our worries behind in the cornfield.)

287
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:18,071
It was another nice day today.

288
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:21,081
So nice.

289
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,281
(The corn we harvested today...)

290
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:30,050
After harvest, we ship them all around the nation in the afternoon,

291
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:31,951
steam some to sell, and more.

292
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:35,391
We have to ship it off right away for it to taste good.

293
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:36,991
If it takes too long, it doesn't taste good anymore.

294
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:39,191
(They were directly shipped to customers that afternoon.)

295
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:43,831
(Now that they have successfully shipped off fresh corn...)

296
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:47,872
Should we head to the supermarket close by again?

297
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:50,841
One moment. I'll look up directions now.

298
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:54,080
- Thank you for your help! - Thank you!

299
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:56,211
- Thank you! - Thank you!

300
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:58,681
- Let's go! - Come here.

301
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,252
We'll get them later.

302
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,180
Goodbye.

303
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:04,892
Thank you! Goodbye!

304
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:08,920
- Bye! - Bye!

305
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:09,961
(Leaving without looking back)

306
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,291
Oh, my.

307
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:15,301
Let's go buy some groceries.

308
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:18,200
Let's go buy some groceries.

309
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,671
(Heading to a supermarket close by to buy ingredients for dinner)

310
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:22,670
- I'm okay with being hot. - You're okay with being hot?

311
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,670
Yes. I don't handle being cold well.

312
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:27,382
Being hot isn't so bad.

313
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:28,742
That's fascinating.

314
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:31,551
Yes. So no one in my family...

315
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:33,282
comes into my room.

316
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,121
- Because it's hot? - They all leave.

317
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:36,181
(Lonely)

318
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,892
We really worked hard today.

319
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:41,761
- Our faces are completely cooked. - You're right.

320
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:43,291
- Right. - They're totally cooked.

321
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:45,930
People will be disappointed when they see me in the supermarket.

322
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,461
- I'm in trouble. - Me too.

323
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,002
Because my face is too red.

324
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:51,271
They must think you had a drink.

325
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:53,801
"Did she drink a lot last night?"

326
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:56,971
(Looking up the supermarket)

327
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:58,871
- Okay. Eun Jin. - Yes?

328
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:01,881
- I'll list out what we need to buy. - I'll write them down.

329
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:02,882
(Making a list before going grocery shopping)

330
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:03,882
Go ahead.

331
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:05,981
First, we're going to make samgyetang, so...

332
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:07,651
(Samgyetang?)

333
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:10,691
We can eat corn and... What was it?

334
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:13,450
- It's boknal today. Jungbok. - Right.

335
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,060
I'm going to make samgyetang.

336
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:16,290
- It's jungbok today. - It's jungbok today.

337
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,060
- It's jungbok. - I didn't realize.

338
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:20,930
Let's stuff the chicken with sticky rice and corn.

339
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:24,002
- That must be so delicious. - I love that idea, Jung Ah.

340
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:27,242
(The siblings worked so hard in the extreme heat.)

341
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:30,201
(Those who worked hard, enjoy a delicious meal!)

342
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:35,311
(They plan to fully recharge with Jung Ah's special samgyetang!)

343
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:38,112
(In addition, seasonal corn that they received as a gift)

344
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:41,252
(A special combination that makes everyone excited for dinner)

345
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:43,450
Do we have sticky rice?

346
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,090
- I think I saw it at home. - Okay.

347
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:46,720
- You did? - Yes. And I saw garlic too.

348
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:47,820
- Okay. - Yes. I saw garlic.

349
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,391
After that, we need milkvetch...

350
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:51,261
- Milkvetch... - and other samgyetang ingredients.

351
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:54,301
- We need samgyetang ingredients. - Samgyetang... Medicinal herbs.

352
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:57,001
- Of course, we need some chickens. - How many?

353
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:58,170
Should we have one chicken each?

354
00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,171
- Five? - Five.

355
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:00,602
- Wait, Jung Ah. Five chickens? - Yes.

356
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:02,772
Jun Myun seems to think we should get more.

357
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:05,441
- Look here. Mr. Cha Tae Hyun. - Do you want more?

358
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:07,070
- What are you talking about? - No, right?

359
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:08,881
One chicken is more than enough.

360
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:10,041
And?

361
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,210
We're going to steam some of the corn.

362
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:14,121
Right. We'll steam the corn.

363
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:16,282
Do we need more side dishes?

364
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:18,451
As long as the kimchi turns out well...

365
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:21,492
Are you making the green onion kimchi,

366
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:22,720
Jun Myun?

367
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,090
I've had her green onion kimchi,

368
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:27,132
- and it's crazy. - Green onion kimchi.

369
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:29,060
Jun Myun has many nicknames,

370
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:31,200
- and one of them is Sauce Park. - Sauce Park.

371
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:32,871
She's so good at making sauces.

372
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:34,970
- I'm Sauce Park. - Sauce Park.

373
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:36,471
- That's me. - Yes.

374
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:38,112
(Suddenly sitting up)

375
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:41,040
Jung Ah. Could I... Could I buy some snacks?

376
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,111
- Go ahead. - Nice!

377
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,311
(I approve.)

378
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:44,680
Oh, snacks.

379
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:45,710
(Touched at her quick approval to spend money)

380
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:47,820
- We don't need money left over. - That was so quick.

381
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:50,181
I'm really going to have fun tomorrow.

382
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:52,521
- What? - I'm going to go to karaoke.

383
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:54,091
- Yes. - So we need money left for that.

384
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:56,521
If we catch eels tomorrow,

385
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,362
- we'll make more money tomorrow. - Right.

386
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:01,661
- We have so much money. - So bountiful.

387
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:03,300
- Our lives are so bountiful. - Seriously.

388
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,902
We should all get new outfits.

389
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:07,131
Should we get matching outfits?

390
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:09,200
(Generosity comes from a full storeroom.)

391
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:10,840
- Well... - Jung Ah.

392
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,711
- Can I ask you one more thing? - Yes.

393
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:15,440
- After we go grocery shopping, - Yes.

394
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:16,611
Are we going to the stream?

395
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,282
(Can we go hang out by the stream?)

396
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:20,511
(The stream all of a sudden?)

397
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:23,950
If we get done with work a bit earlier,

398
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,651
there is a stream instead of the ocean.

399
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:27,591
- Right. It's so hot. - Really?

400
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,060
It's a place called Ori Deombeong.

401
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:31,731
- That's the name? - Yes. Ori Deombeong.

402
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:32,762
Can we go there?

403
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:35,560
- Jung Ah. That must be great. - I like that better.

404
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:37,970
We have to go snorkeling in the stream.

405
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:39,801
(Their hearts are already in Ori Deombeong.)

406
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:42,570
We'll quickly stop by the stream.

407
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:44,371
- Okay. - Let's take some pictures.

408
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:45,641
- Okay. - Sounds good.

409
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:48,840
- Enough to cool down a bit, right? - Yes.

410
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:52,681
(A thrilling reward after working in the extreme heat)

411
00:14:53,752 --> 00:14:56,021
My face is finally cooling down a bit.

412
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:58,391
- Totally. - I thought my face would explode.

413
00:14:58,392 --> 00:14:59,721
(I thought my face would explode earlier...)

414
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:03,992
Tae Hyun. What is that? Well... That...

415
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:08,031
I have a question about variety shows.

416
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,800
(A question?)

417
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:12,002
Could you make a two-line acrostic poem with Goseong?

418
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:13,940
With Goseong, since this is a variety show...

419
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,300
Going on this show is a dream.

420
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:16,841
- Something like this. - Oh, my.

421
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:18,841
- Seong. - Sung deeply in my heart!

422
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:23,512
- Gosh, you're good. - You're really good.

423
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:25,180
- That was so good. - That was amazing.

424
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:26,611
He goes on variety shows a lot

425
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:27,621
- for a reason. - Seriously.

426
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:28,652
(Master is the best.)

427
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:31,450
I think it's somewhere around here.

428
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:32,920
- Here it is. - Here it is.

429
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:34,190
(While they were busy being impressed by Tae Hyun, )

430
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,221
(they arrived at the supermarket.)

431
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:37,190
Is one enough?

432
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:39,330
- One is enough. - Yes, I think that's enough.

433
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:41,232
Something already smells good.

434
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:42,801
Will we be able to pass by them?

435
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:46,032
- We'll buy things we need first. - Okay.

436
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:47,401
(I'm just saying...)

437
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:48,441
(Laughing)

438
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,810
- What? - What did you grab?

439
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:51,811
Fresh cream buns.

440
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:53,142
- Oh, fresh cream. - Why do you keep laughing?

441
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:54,841
I can take a look.

442
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:56,742
- They keep catching your eye. - Goodness.

443
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,080
Earlier... Onions. We need to buy onions.

444
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:02,281
Yes. Onion, zucchini, cucumber, and carrot.

445
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:04,321
Those are the things in the vegetable section here.

446
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:05,820
- Gosh. - Zucchini.

447
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:06,950
(The first target, zucchini)

448
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:08,820
- One. Yes. - One?

449
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,361
Today, tomorrow...

450
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:11,392
(Simulating the cooking in her head)

451
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,061
For today and tomorrow.

452
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:16,002
(Getting a sack of onions to be safe)

453
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:20,300
(Next, unwashed carrots)

454
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,742
You have so many cooks in this group.

455
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:27,210
(Moving to the self-check scale)

456
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:28,940
Don't employees usually do that for you?

457
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:30,912
No. You have to do this yourself.

458
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:32,710
Do you?

459
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:34,550
It is. That's how it's done lately.

460
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:35,551
(Do they have these in the supermarket in my neighborhood?)

461
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:36,652
Everyone does it themselves.

462
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:38,621
(Happy)

463
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,122
(Next, buying chicken, the main part of samgyetang)

464
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,262
You can eat this much per person, right?

465
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:45,431
Going in.

466
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,602
- We got five chickens. - Five chickens.

467
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,601
We can put these in the refrigerator later, so they can be warm.

468
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:52,671
Gosh. We...

469
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:54,772
bought so much.

470
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,241
- Thank you. - Thank you.

471
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:58,512
Thank you.

472
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:01,180
- There it is. We have ice. - Will this be okay?

473
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:03,882
- Put them in the bottom. - This is enough ice.

474
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,820
I didn't even eat chicken on chobok.

475
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,580
- Eating samgyetang on jungbok... - Gosh.

476
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:12,851
- I'm so grateful. - I'm so grateful for this day.

477
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:15,490
- We're having a good meal today. - I've never eaten...

478
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:16,920
food like that...

479
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:19,760
- You never ate samgyetang? - on boknal.

480
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:22,561
Because I didn't like going to crowded places.

481
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:23,861
(You can finally celebrate boknal properly today.)

482
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,132
And I don't cook it at home.

483
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:29,601
(Heading to the stream to play in the water)

484
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:31,412
Let's go.

485
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:34,842
Oh, my!

486
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:38,210
- Can we pass through this? - What is this?

487
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:40,822
- What is this? - What is this? Can we go through?

488
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:43,376
Oh, my!

489
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,744
- Can we pass through this? - What is this?

490
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:47,875
What is this? This is insane.

491
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:50,046
- What is this? Can we go through? - I love it.

492
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:52,744
- I'm so scared. - Are we the only ones here?

493
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:53,985
Oh, my.

494
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:58,455
(When you carefully pass through the "Oh, my" tunnel)

495
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,925
- This is insane. - I love it.

496
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,326
Are we the only ones here?

497
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:08,265
(The clouds have come to provide them with shade.)

498
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:11,606
(And the breeze with cool them down.)

499
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,775
(The clean water in the stream even refreshes their hearts.)

500
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:19,605
(This is Ori Deombeong in Goseong...)

501
00:18:19,606 --> 00:18:21,474
(where even the boknal heat takes a pause.)

502
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,146
Gosh. I love it.

503
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:25,745
We should take a selfie.

504
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:28,555
This is insane.

505
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:29,786
(Me too)

506
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:31,485
(That's it?)

507
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,455
Jung Ah. Let's take a selfie before going in.

508
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:38,895
- Okay. Look here, everyone. - Where should we look?

509
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,425
(Using a new selfie stick as Dex isn't here)

510
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:41,636
One, two.

511
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:46,765
(First stream visit of the year, Dex, We miss you.)

512
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:49,875
Nice. A blanket?

513
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:52,606
(Now, they just need to jump in the water...)

514
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:54,846
- This is too bumpy. - Do you think it's cold today?

515
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:58,445
That's a pretty deep stream.

516
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:01,685
Oh, my.

517
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:03,156
How can we go in?

518
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:06,425
I think it'll get deeper the farther in we go.

519
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:11,425
(Now that they're actually here, they're all hesitating.)

520
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:17,235
(Okay. I, Ahn Eun Jin...)

521
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,536
I think we need to float around.

522
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:22,734
Let's try going in at least once.

523
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:24,004
(She decides to take the lead.)

524
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:27,005
- I'll go in first. - She loves going in the water.

525
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:29,174
How nice and cool.

526
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:31,116
(This time, I'll conquer this stream!)

527
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:32,386
(Pausing)

528
00:19:32,816 --> 00:19:34,715
I'm not good with streams.

529
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:38,326
I've always been like that because they're too cold.

530
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:42,626
I've always been bad when it comes to streams.

531
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:45,264
(Unlike when she was in the ocean...)

532
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:46,265
Wait.

533
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:47,796
Are you just going in like that?

534
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:49,636
It's cool.

535
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,306
(Jung Ah prefers streams.)

536
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,876
(Eun Jin follows Jung Ah into the water.)

537
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:57,376
What? It's not that cold.

538
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:02,316
What? It's not as cold as the Yeongdeok ocean. Streams aren't bad.

539
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,075
Gosh. Really?

540
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:05,546
(They slowly open their hearts.)

541
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:09,156
Oh, yes. This is perfect. This is great.

542
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:12,386
- Streams aren't bad. - Gosh. It's so nice and cool.

543
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:16,856
(Jung Ah is already playing in the water.)

544
00:20:17,156 --> 00:20:18,525
(Breaststroke)

545
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,965
(Backstroke)

546
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:24,165
(But she can't go anywhere.)

547
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:27,235
(Pulling goggles over her head)

548
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,734
(This is Jun Myun.)

549
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:30,975
Isn't this so nice?

550
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:34,615
(Bursting to laughter thanks to funny Jun Myun)

551
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:35,745
You're right. This is so nice.

552
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:37,646
Hello.

553
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:41,815
I can feel this is a hidden gem. Why?

554
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:42,955
- What is she saying? - Because...

555
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:45,585
(Someone stop her. Laughing)

556
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:46,626
You're right. This is so nice.

557
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:50,156
Hello. This is Ahn Eun Jin's "People Are Good" interview.

558
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:54,194
You only got here not too long ago today.

559
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:55,896
How do you feel after helping out with work?

560
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:58,336
I love it.

561
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:01,076
- We did a good amount of work. - Right.

562
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:04,805
I think more fun things will happen from now on.

563
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,504
- They will. - Are you...

564
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,545
interested in catching pike eel with us tomorrow...

565
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:11,215
- No. - Oh, not yet?

566
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,215
- Okay. - Okay.

567
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:15,715
I will head off to do another interview.

568
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:17,454
How do you feel today?

569
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:20,224
Pretty good. It's not as cold as I expected.

570
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,755
- It's so warm, right? - Yes.

571
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:26,195
Also, I think the sun will go down soon.

572
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:28,295
Goodbye.

573
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:30,165
(I have to make dinner, but playing in the water is so fun...)

574
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:34,106
How do you feel, Ms. Yum?

575
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:37,205
(For your information, Jun Myun used to be a reporter as well.)

576
00:21:37,406 --> 00:21:38,606
How do you feel, Ms. Yum?

577
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:42,275
I'm good. I'm feeling good.

578
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:49,286
(There's a reporter that shoots herself?)

579
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:52,524
(Well, then. Bye.)

580
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:53,655
(Coughing)

581
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:54,656
Gosh.

582
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,796
This summer is the best. I'm doing everything I want.

583
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:05,235
(Before the hot summer ends, )

584
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:10,336
(let's have lots of fun!)

585
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:16,046
(It's even better if we're together.)

586
00:22:18,116 --> 00:22:20,615
Normal Jung Ah and fish number one.

587
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:22,655
You two look so funny up close.

588
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:24,656
(You two look so funny up close.)

589
00:22:25,356 --> 00:22:26,755
- You look like fish. - Really?

590
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:30,356
- It was short, but it was nice. - Yes.

591
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:33,825
(Should we go to have dinner now?)

592
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:35,734
- Let's go. - Let's go.

593
00:22:35,735 --> 00:22:36,796
(Should we go to have dinner now?)

594
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:41,234
I feel bad that we're making you drive so much.

595
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,475
It's okay. I like this.

596
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:49,914
So nice.

597
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:51,046
(They all feel relaxed after playing in the water.)

598
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,856
I feel a bit sleepy and relaxed.

599
00:22:57,286 --> 00:22:59,424
- Because you were in the water. - Because you played in the water.

600
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:02,754
We're going to arrive at 6:24pm.

601
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:05,524
- For 3 people to wash up... - Should we start at 7pm?

602
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:07,225
We can start at 7pm. It won't take long.

603
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:11,906
First, I'll soak the sticky rice.

604
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,764
So please put everything we bought today...

605
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:15,306
- in the refrigerator. - Okay.

606
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:17,805
- Then I'll steam the corn first. - Okay.

607
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:19,675
On the fire we use to steam the corn,

608
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:21,245
I'll make the samgyetang...

609
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:22,546
- as the corn steams. - Okay.

610
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:26,484
Then I'll wash up first and make green onion kimchi.

611
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:27,485
- Okay. - Okay.

612
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:29,915
Oh, my. We're so fast.

613
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:33,126
Do you know how to make pancakes, Eun Jin?

614
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,356
- We can do that together. Yes. - Really?

615
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:38,494
- Can you not make pancakes? - Well,

616
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:39,825
- I can. - Do you want to make...

617
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,164
the chive pancakes?

618
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:42,296
- I don't know how either. - Really?

619
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:43,896
- I can learn. - We can do it together.

620
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:46,734
- I'll tell you how, so try it. - Of course.

621
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:49,704
- In the water... - Use beer instead of water.

622
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:50,774
I see.

623
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:53,204
- Why do you add beer? - If you add beer,

624
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:54,974
- it makes it crispier. - The carbonation makes it crispier.

625
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,146
(Inputting pro tips to two cooking newbies)

626
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:59,346
- And mix it up. Give it a try. - We can figure it out.

627
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:01,786
(Will I be able to do it?)

628
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:04,826
That nervous feeling

629
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:09,626
That nervous feeling

630
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:12,566
(I feel relieved now that planning is done.)

631
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:14,895
(They're already back in the village.)

632
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:17,396
Gosh. We have lots to carry.

633
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:22,605
(Taking their precious corn into the house)

634

Jung Ah.

635
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:26,645
You farted, didn't you? Toot, toot.

636
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:28,115
- You farted! - No, I didn't.

637
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:29,146
(Happily walking back home)

638

(Jung Ah, who arrived first...)

639
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:37,515
Home is the best. It's the best.

640
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:40,525
- Tae Hyun. Yes, they go inside. - Do these go inside?

641
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:43,396
(Guiding her young siblings)

642
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,195

Tae Hyun.

646
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:04,245
Tae Hyun. You can wash up here.

647
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:05,944
- There? - Here.

648
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:08,715
I see. I can wash up later.

649
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:12,485
(In the end, the ladies decided to wash up first...)

650
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:14,555
Why do they shower so many times a day?

651
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:17,826
Isn't it enough to shower once later?

652
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:20,025
I think I'll dry off soon.

653
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:24,366
Gosh. What should I do? I feel so lazy.

654
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:27,035
(He suddenly wipes off the wooden bed and...)

655
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:29,274
Gosh. This place is amazing.

656
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:31,175
Gosh. I love this place.

657
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:36,116
(Lying down and rolling around)

658
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:39,616
(Cha Laid-Back)

659
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,215
You look like a grandson at his grandmother's house.

660
00:25:42,286 --> 00:25:45,156
(Laughing)

661
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,695
(Finally, the 48-year-old grandson reluctantly goes to wash up...)

662
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:53,895
(Meanwhile, Jun Myun gets a phone call.)

663
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:55,335
- Jun Myun. - Yes?

664
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:57,635
- Jun Myun. - Where are you?

665
00:25:57,636 --> 00:26:00,434
- I'm almost there, Jun Myun. - You're almost here?

666
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,204
- Jun Myun. - Yes?

667
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:03,205
Don't you miss me?

668
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:05,575
I really miss you. Hurry up. What is it?

669
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:08,115
- Does it feel empty without me? - I'm going crazy.

670
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:09,116
- You're going crazy... - You have to hurry over here.

671
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:10,645
Things are no joke right now.

672
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:13,386
I'm going there as quickly as possible. Wait a bit longer.

673
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:16,556
- Okay. - Okay.

674
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:19,786
They missed me so much.

675
00:26:20,656 --> 00:26:21,826
When should I go in?

676
00:26:22,356 --> 00:26:24,965
I have to start the fire for them. That's all that's on my mind.

677
00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:26,664
(But he became anxious thinking about the fire...)

678
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,035
I have to start the fire soon.

679
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:29,066
(But he became anxious thinking about the fire...)

680
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:31,836
(But he waits for a bit to surprise them.)

681
00:26:32,235 --> 00:26:34,734
(What's going on in the house at this moment...)

682
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:36,106
(with the sisters who have no idea?)

683
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:41,146
I hope my daughter will grow up to be someone like Eun Jin.

684
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:43,876
That must be nice. Gosh.

685
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:48,754
- Get up now. - What should I do?

686
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:50,356
- I'm going to wash the corn. - Okay.

687
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:52,724
- Do we wash them? - Yes.

688
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:53,725
Okay.

689
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:54,796
He gets up at once.

690
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:57,225
(The grandson is obedient, though.)

691
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:59,725
What am I supposed to do with these?

692
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:03,464
Peel these.

693
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:04,566
(First, they clean the corn.)

694
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:06,606
Leave the last husk on.

695
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:09,235
- Only the last husk? - Leave the last husk on.

696
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:13,075
Come to think of it, it had one husk when I ate it.

697
00:27:13,076 --> 00:27:15,975
Yes. As for the corn silk,

698
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:19,616
we'll break it off and boil it together with the corn.

699
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:24,014
- It gives off sweetness. - Really?

700
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:25,826
(Boil the corn with the silk to add sweetness and flavor.)

701
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:32,796
Yes. For dinner, with the goal of having one chicken per person.

702
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,036
We bought five small chickens.

703
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:39,035
I will stuff them with glutinous rice and corn...

704
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:40,606
to make samgyetang.

705
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:42,775
Also, Jun Myun...

706
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:45,046
is making green onion kimchi.

707
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:49,014
Yes. We will boil...

708
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,846
all of the corn we got.

709
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:52,485
We will eat and share them.

710
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:56,156
We will keep the rest in the fridge and use it for others.

711
00:27:58,156 --> 00:27:59,826
Don't we need to prepare the chickens?

712
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:03,695
We will boil the corn first.

713
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:05,524
(A reliever comes at the right moment.)

714
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:07,025
- Come here. - Yes.

715
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:09,136
- You're here. - Tae Hyun, teach her how to do it.

716
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:10,336
- What? - Teach her.

717
00:28:10,337 --> 00:28:11,565
- Should I work on these? - Me? Okay.

718
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:12,566
Have a seat, Agent Ahn.

719
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:14,204
Remove the husk.

720
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:15,406
- "Remove the husk." - Yes.

721
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:20,705
Gosh. I'm teaching someone for the first time in my life...

722
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,245
about food.

723
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:25,714
You're supposed to peel them...

724
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:27,745
until there's only one layer.

725
00:28:28,255 --> 00:28:30,815
- I don't peel the completely. - Don't peel them completely.

726
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:32,425
If we peel them completely...

727
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:33,984
- Yes? - we get canceled.

728
00:28:33,985 --> 00:28:34,994
(Confused)

729
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:37,296
The corn becomes shy.

730
00:28:37,495 --> 00:28:38,524
Don't make them completely naked.

731
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:40,365
- You should almost see through. - Right. We're a good show.

732
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:41,366
- Yes. - Our show is suitable...

733
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:42,366
for viewers over 12.

734
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,164
- Right. - I cannot let them...

735
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,405
- show their bare skin. - Right.

736
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,065
Right. If they're totally naked,

737
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:49,535
it's not suitable for viewers under 15.

738
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,536
That's right.

739
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:53,605
Do I peel it this much? No? I do peel off one more?

740
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,375
- It should be a see-through. - A see-through.

741
00:28:55,376 --> 00:28:57,915
- Okay. A see-through is okay. - Yes. Okay. I got it.

742
00:28:57,975 --> 00:29:01,185
If it's see-through or half-naked, it's acceptable.

743
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:04,755
(Professor Cha's variety show class, not a cooking class)

744
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:07,424
Do I break it... Jung Ah's doing the other way.

745
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:08,754
Can we get rid of the part we don't need?

746
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:10,655
- You're doing something else. - I'm going to put these...

747
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:11,795
in samgyetang.

748
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:14,295
You're getting each kernel of the corn.

749
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:15,665
(Jung Ah takes out the kernels.)

750
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:21,235
(The kernels Jung Ah carefully removes 1 by 1...)

751
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:25,745
(are washed thoroughly.)

752
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:29,775
(They are ready in one bowl.)

753
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:32,685
(The glutinous rice soaked already in water)

754
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:35,056
(Draining)

755
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:38,725
(The stuffing for the chickens are ready.)

756
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:42,826
I am showing my back to Jung Ah all day, though I didn't intend to.

757
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:45,524
Can you show your back in a variety show?

758
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:46,664
- Is it okay? - No. You can't show...

759
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,836
your back on camera. But the camera is in front of me too.

760
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,535
- So it doesn't matter. - Keep my eyes open...

761
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:54,235
- and locate the cameras. - Of course.

762
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:57,876
Tae Hyun, do you know which camera is shooting you right away?

763
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:00,846
That's when I am on a music show.

764
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:03,145
- Right. - You just stare at the red light.

765
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:04,646
- This way. That way. - I see.

766
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:07,115
I regret it, my love Something like that.

767
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:08,386
(Professor Cha with 2 albums)

768
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:10,816
It's amazing how I found the cameras.

769
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:14,586
When I think the camera crane will about to come, I see it.

770
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:17,025
- Gosh. Nice. - You have to rehearse it.

771
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:20,796
(At that moment!)

772
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:24,136
(The youngest arrives at the front of the house.)

773
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:26,164
(He sees the guest.)

774
00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:28,734
You have to monitor it and see what to...

775
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:31,646
- Everyone! - For goodness' sake.

776
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,445
Hey!

777
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:35,816
Tae Hyun, hello.

778
00:30:37,346 --> 00:30:38,646
(He's happy to see him.)

779
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:40,886
But he...

780
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:43,714
- Tae Hyun. - It's nice to see you.

781
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:45,484
Tae Hyun. Goodness.

782
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:46,655
- You know each other, right? - It's been a while.

783
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:49,326
- Yes, we've met before. - We've met once before.

784
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:51,725
Dex, did you do well in Seoul today?

785
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:53,565
Yes. I made money.

786
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:55,335
- He achieved fame and prestige... - Really?

787
00:30:55,336 --> 00:30:56,566
In Seoul.

788
00:30:57,735 --> 00:31:00,336
- Didn't you miss me? - I missed you. How have you been?

789
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:01,535
- Whatever. - Okay. Bye.

790
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:02,536
- Satisfied? - Don't do it.

791
00:31:03,036 --> 00:31:04,204
We don't say such stuff.

792
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,975
What's wrong? You asked for it.

793
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:08,145
So I did, but you're complaining. What do you want me to do?

794
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:10,345
Jung Ah, I have to change these too.

795
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:11,375
I'll remove them for you.

796
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:12,885
We'll remove them and put new ones on.

797
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:14,385
I put these on last time.

798
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:16,085
- It's cracked. - I heard about it.

799
00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:17,514
They scraped off.

800
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:19,326
- Jun Myun. - Yes?

801
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:21,485
- You're here. - Jun Myun.

802
00:31:22,326 --> 00:31:23,425
Welcome.

803
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:27,366
- We eat dinner now, right? - Yes.

804
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:29,066
What are we having?

805
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:32,735
(The lights shine in the evening in Garyong Village in Goseong.)

806
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:37,005
(What are the neighbors eating for dinner?)

807
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:39,705
(Ms. Park In Soon's house)

808
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:42,816
They are tasty because they were exposed to the sea breeze.

809
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:44,376
It has a richer taste.

810
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:47,586
I cut the corn kernels.

811
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:50,215
Blend them.

812
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:53,356
I add Cheongyang chili chives and grill it.

813
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:59,495
(Corn jeon without flour)

814
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:03,165
(She takes each corn kernel out.)

815
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:10,136
To make corn rice, I add the peeled corn to the washed rice.

816
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:11,376
I add a little beat of beans too.

817
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:16,046
(The corn rice with the popping sweetness)

818
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:20,386
(Using the corn in the sea breeze, )

819
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:23,786
(this is Ms. Park In Soon's table with in-season foods.)

820
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:26,725
(Please look forward to the siblings' dinner too.)

821
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:28,156
(Growing up in the sea breeze...)

822
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,156
(in Goseong, South Gyeongsang Province)

823
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:30,454
(C, S, F)

824
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:31,555
(Chewy)

825
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:32,764
(Sweet)

826
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:33,866
(Flavorful)

827
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:37,896
(The corn in-season will take care of it.)

828
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:42,405
(The corn they harvested this morning...)

829
00:32:42,406 --> 00:32:45,146
(gets a surprising makeover.)

830
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:48,616
(Please look forward to it.)

831
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:51,415
I need to scan the area.

832
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,886
Where is my brazier?

833
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:55,454
Gosh.

834
00:32:55,455 --> 00:32:57,385
- He's reliable, right? - He is.

835
00:32:57,386 --> 00:32:59,825
- Everyone has their own role. - Yes.

836
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:00,856
He's good.

837
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:02,626
Okay.

838
00:33:03,096 --> 00:33:05,896
You can add water after we put the corn.

839
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:08,495
- Just make the fire first. - Okay.

840
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:11,066
(Quest: Fire, Accepted)

841
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:15,036
(He piles up the firewood skillfully.)

842
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:18,576
(Dex's item, the torch, is here.)

843
00:33:22,346 --> 00:33:24,746
(Dex, the wood fire specialist)

844
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:27,286
(He opens the air hole to make fire more easily.)

845
00:33:27,287 --> 00:33:29,484
- You've met each other before. - We met twice.

846
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:30,886
- Twice? - Twice.

847
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:33,425
Dex, that fish trap.

848
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:36,255
Right, the fish trap. Should I throw it in?

849
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:38,826
- I'll throw it in tonight. - Yes.

850
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:41,064
We'll check it in the tomorrow morning.

851
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:43,436
It'll be great if we catch something for breakfast.

852
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,035
(Scratching)

853
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:47,335
Do you learn to use the fish trap in UDT?

854
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:48,935
We don't.

855
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:52,144
I think if we ask around the seniors here, they would know.

856
00:33:52,145 --> 00:33:53,545
Do UDT soldiers know everything?

857
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:55,516
Shouldn't they know everything related to the sea?

858
00:33:55,815 --> 00:33:57,746
(She is quite logical.)

859
00:33:57,945 --> 00:33:59,885
I'll check the spots later.

860
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:00,886
(He'll throw it later.)

861
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:03,686
(He focuses back on the fire.)

862
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:08,425
(With the youngest's touch...)

863
00:34:10,826 --> 00:34:12,326
The fire is ready already.

864
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:15,064
- You're quick. - Come on.

865
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:16,436
He's quite skilled.

866
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:18,095
I know how to do it.

867
00:34:18,096 --> 00:34:19,465
(It only takes 7 minutes to make fire.)

868
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:23,105
Jung Ah, fire is ready. What should I do now?

869
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:24,975
- The corn needs to be ready. - Okay.

870
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,675
- We'll add the corn and water. - Yes.

871
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:29,644
- They need to be peeled quickly. - We need to wash them.

872
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:30,815
I see. I'll wash them.

873
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,214
(His next quest is to wash the corn.)

874
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:33,846
I can wash them in here for a few times.

875
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:35,715
- Wash them. - Yes.

876
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:37,915
- They're ready. No? - But the corn silk...

877
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,325
- They're ready. - They are,

878
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:40,556
but you have to remove the corn silk.

879
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:42,156
Wait. Do we put the corn silk too?

880
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,095
She told us to put them in.

881
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,665
Wash them separately and...

882
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:47,725
put them in too.

883
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:51,135
- Hey, Dex! - Yes?

884
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:53,464
We left them on purpose, so it could be see-through.

885
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:54,866
Is that so?

886
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:57,774
- It was so hard to leave it. - You can't remove it.

887
00:34:57,775 --> 00:34:59,975
- You can't strip it off. - I can't follow them.

888
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:02,444
- We'll get caught. - The show will be R-rated.

889
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:03,714
What are you doing?

890
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,745
- Because it'll be R-rated? - We want a 12-year-old limit.

891
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:06,944
- You can't do that. - I see.

892
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:08,754
I got it. I'll cover them.

893
00:35:08,755 --> 00:35:10,984
- I'll cover them with a blanket. - Yes.

894
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:11,985
With this.

895
00:35:12,456 --> 00:35:13,924
She told us to leave 1 or 2 layers.

896
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:16,355
- Yes. - That's what Master Yum said.

897
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:20,795
(The corn is taking a shower. Suitable for 12 years old.)

898
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:24,636
(Master Yum gets ready to make samgyetang.)

899
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:28,735
(Delicately)

900
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,206
(She removes the parts that they can't eat.)

901
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:35,576
(Cutting)

902
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:39,715
(She washes the inside thoroughly too.)

903
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:42,655
(Washing chickens and the corn)

904
00:35:42,656 --> 00:35:45,686
I love how there are many people and crowded on our first day.

905
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:47,355
- Right? - Yes.

906
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:48,355
(Me too.)

907
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:52,064
Gosh. Is Jun Myun making kimchi alone in there?

908
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:54,194
- She's making the seasoning. - Sauce Park.

909
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,394
Yes, Suace Park.

910
00:35:55,395 --> 00:35:57,265
Because she's alone,

911
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:59,535
it feels like she's someone...

912
00:35:59,536 --> 00:36:00,766
who would never show her sauce to others...

913
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,906
- Totally. - at a famous restaurant.

914
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:05,746
- Right? - You're totally right.

915
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:09,975
(Sauce Park's secret green onion kimchi)

916
00:36:09,976 --> 00:36:11,675
(I'll do business with it.)

917
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:13,415
(In 6 months, )

918
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,056
(it will be sold on the home shopping channel.)

919
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:18,625
(The seasoning from Fresh off the Sea)

920
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:21,226
(Jun Myun, give me 2 percent of the shares.)

921
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:22,694
(What are you talking about?)

922
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:23,695
(No?)

923
00:36:23,696 --> 00:36:25,565
(No way)

924
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:30,096
(We'll reveal the secret recipe right now.)

925
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:32,766
Jung Ah, I'll start making the green onion kimchi right away.

926
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:34,706
Where did she go?

927
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:37,476
(First, she cuts the dried chili into large pieces...)

928
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:42,116
(and soaks them in water for a moment.)

929
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,945
(After washing the green onions thoroughly, )

930
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:49,516
(she starts making the seasoning.)

931
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:51,285
(She chops the red chilis...)

932
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:53,625
(and adds to the blender.)

933
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,555
(She chops the sweet onions...)

934
00:36:58,556 --> 00:37:00,195
(and adds to the blender too.)

935
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:03,766
(Here's Sauce Park's kick.)

936
00:37:05,065 --> 00:37:08,436
(To maximize the sweetness and add umami, )

937
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:12,145
(she puts a whole green apple.)

938
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:16,544
(Lastly, she adds the soaked dried chilis..)

939
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:17,945
(and the water from it.)

940
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:21,386
(She blends everything together.)

941
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:25,886
(To the well-blended base...)

942
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:30,195
(Soy sauce, starch syrup, plum preserves, chili powder)

943
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:32,565
(Blend everything well.)

944
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:37,065
(It's not enough.)

945
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:39,835
(Sauce Park's second kick.)

946
00:37:40,206 --> 00:37:43,835
(Adding lots of tina fish sauce and salted shrimp for freshness)

947
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,945
(She puts generous amount of the flavorful sesame seeds too.)

948
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:49,246
I don't know how the green onion kimchi will taste.

949
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:50,975
It'll taste good.

950
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,015
(A spoonful of Dex's encouragement)

951
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:53,585
I can't wait.

952
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:55,516
I eat a lot of green onion kimchi.

953
00:37:56,855 --> 00:37:59,355
(She tastes it for the final time.)

954
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,725
I think it's ready.

955
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:04,726
(It's a pass.)

956
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:08,965
(Now, let's season them nicely.)

957
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,104
Jung Ah, do you want to taste the green onion kimchi?

958
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:16,775
- Yes. - Yes?

959
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:18,076
Let me try it.

960
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:20,406
I'm not confident because it's not my home.

961
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:23,215
(There's no doubt.)

962
00:38:24,246 --> 00:38:25,314
It's seasoned perfectly.

963
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:27,145
(This is Sauce Park we're talking about.)

964
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:29,485
I see. She's making the seasoning for the green onion kimchi.

965
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:33,125
(After washing the corn thoroughly)

966
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:36,556
- Are you going to put that on? - Yes.

967
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:39,694
- Find saccharin and salt. - "Saccharin and salt."

968
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,925
"Saccharin and salt."

969
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,166
Here they are.

970
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:46,104
- Salt and... - Four spoonfuls.

971
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:47,665
- "Four spoonfuls." - No. Five spoonfuls.

972
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:49,475
- How about saccharin? - Right.

973
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:52,035
Put five spoons but cut the excess out.

974
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:54,104
- I see. Just five spoons. - Five without excess.

975
00:38:54,105 --> 00:38:56,745
This is about the amount, right, Jung Ah?

976
00:38:56,746 --> 00:38:58,786
(She double-checks the order.)

977
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:02,085
Okay. One.

978
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:05,424
Close the lid. In 20 minutes,

979
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,355
- please give it a stir. - Yes.

980
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,596
(The corn is boiling well.)

981
00:39:12,326 --> 00:39:16,366
(Commander Yum leads the kitchen flawlessly.)

982
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:21,036
(In the meantime, she finishes cleaning five raw chickens.)

983
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:25,136
- I'll make a pancake. - Right now?

984
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:26,375
Try it.

985
00:39:26,706 --> 00:39:27,906
With Tae Hyun.

986
00:39:28,976 --> 00:39:30,275
How do we make chive jeon?

987
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:32,616
For the chive jeon...

988
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,485
"Hotcake..." Hotcake mix is not right.

989
00:39:36,056 --> 00:39:38,484
- Pancake flour and batter powder. - Mix the two.

990
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:40,955
Half and half? Is it 1-on-1 ratio?

991
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:42,624
- Just feel it. - "Feel it?"

992
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,695
Yes.

993
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:45,826
What should we do?

994
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,495
How will it feel?

995
00:39:47,496 --> 00:39:50,065
It will feel like a pancake.

996
00:39:50,636 --> 00:39:51,694
Just feel it.

997
00:39:51,695 --> 00:39:54,505
(Sauce Park says, "Just feel it to cook.")

998
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:56,706
- Do we put it in? - Let's go.

999
00:39:59,545 --> 00:40:01,675
These powders look the same.

1000
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,515
Which one is the batter and which is...

1001
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:06,015
- No one is stopping us. - Exactly.

1002
00:40:06,016 --> 00:40:08,746
- Is this enough? - Is it? Is this enough?

1003
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:10,515
Someone tell us.

1004
00:40:10,516 --> 00:40:12,226
- How much are you going to make? - We don't know.

1005
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:14,025
Is it about this much?

1006
00:40:14,585 --> 00:40:17,056
- More? - Yes. You can put more.

1007
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:18,995
How many chives do you have?

1008
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:21,395
You should prepare the chive first.

1009
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:23,734
Wash the chives first.

1010
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:25,705
- Wash and chop them. - Wash the chives. Okay.

1011
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:27,165
This felt...

1012
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,075
- like 1-on-1 ratio. - And we add beer, Tae Hyun.

1013
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:30,535
Okay. To here?

1014
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:32,674
You add beer instead of water.

1015
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:35,246
- There's beer in there. - Beer, instead of water.

1016
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:37,314
- Why? - How much?

1017
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:39,746
Someone just like me is here.

1018
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:43,215
Look. How much should I put? I'm pouring.

1019
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,785
Jun Myun, I'm pouring. How much should I put in?

1020
00:40:45,786 --> 00:40:47,656
- Tell me when. - Now.

1021
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,194
Stir it.

1022
00:40:49,195 --> 00:40:50,855
Stir it and make a light batter.

1023
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:52,056
- "A light batter." - Yes.

1024
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:54,996
(This is like an Avatar cooking.)

1025
00:40:55,326 --> 00:40:56,564
Be light.

1026
00:40:56,565 --> 00:40:58,366
I think it's very light.

1027
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:00,035
Jun Myun,

1028
00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:02,406
how big the pieces should be?

1029
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:04,406
- About 6cm? - Okay.

1030
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:05,575
"About 6cm."

1031
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:06,576
(Avatar cooking 2)

1032
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:08,605
(She cuts the chives as she was told.)

1033
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,314
Put them in.

1034
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:11,345
"Put them in?" Right away?

1035
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:13,785
Hold on. Let's get it confirmed. Wait.

1036
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:15,854
- I think it's ready. Put them in. - Put them in right away?

1037
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:18,056
- Yes. And add dried shrimp. - Okay.

1038
00:41:18,215 --> 00:41:20,786
- Do I put in the whole bag? - Half a bag.

1039
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:22,025
- "Half a bag." - Yes.

1040
00:41:22,456 --> 00:41:25,195
- Adding half a bag. - Adding half a bag.

1041
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,025
Add more.

1042
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:29,234
Is this about right?

1043
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:31,194
- I think it's about right. - Really? Good.

1044
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:33,666
Really. It's really...

1045
00:41:33,835 --> 00:41:34,835
I think so.

1046
00:41:35,436 --> 00:41:36,874
(After going through a hassle, batter that feels right is ready.)

1047
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,505
- It looks familiar. - Does it feel right?

1048
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:41,175
(At the same time, on the platform)

1049
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:44,746
I am standing in front of you

1050
00:41:46,016 --> 00:41:48,585
(Commander Yum fills up the chickens.)

1051
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:52,155
- I'm adding... - Yes.

1052
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:55,055
The corn kernels and glutinous rice.

1053
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:56,125
I see.

1054
00:41:56,425 --> 00:41:57,555
It needs glutinous rice, right?

1055
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,865
Jung Ah, put twice as much in mine, please.

1056
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:02,694
Would you be able to tell which is which?

1057
00:42:02,695 --> 00:42:03,996
(You're troubling me.)

1058
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:07,065
You can write my name on it with a pen.

1059
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:10,405
(But don't worry, the youngest.)

1060
00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:12,545
(You know how generous I am, right?)

1061
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:15,505
(I'll stuff corn kernels and the glutinous rice...)

1062
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:19,445
(until the stomach explodes.)

1063
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:22,855
(Lastly, )

1064
00:42:24,116 --> 00:42:26,255
(she cuts a slit on one side...)

1065
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:30,556
(and pass the other side through to fix it.)

1066
00:42:31,656 --> 00:42:34,266
(One chicken is ready.)

1067
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,595
It starts to steam. It'll take about 20 minutes from now.

1068
00:42:38,596 --> 00:42:39,765
(The pot with the corn starts to steam too.)

1069
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,335
- As for the corn, - Yes.

1070
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:45,036
We need to lower the heat and steam it.

1071
00:42:45,335 --> 00:42:47,105
- I see. - For ten minutes.

1072
00:42:47,605 --> 00:42:48,605
I'll try it.

1073
00:42:49,116 --> 00:42:50,976
- You'll control the heat? - Yes.

1074
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:54,386
- I can control it from high to low. - Yes. You need to control it.

1075
00:42:55,145 --> 00:42:56,314
It's a Bluetooth kindling.

1076
00:42:56,315 --> 00:42:57,656
(It even comes with the Bluetooth function.)

1077
00:42:58,985 --> 00:43:00,255
Dex is the most energetic one.

1078
00:43:00,656 --> 00:43:02,695
Of course. I didn't work today.

1079
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:06,266
(Feeling sorry for arriving late, )

1080
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:09,596
(he tries harder than usual.)

1081
00:43:11,636 --> 00:43:14,166
Yes. I'll heat up the pan.

1082
00:43:14,735 --> 00:43:17,905
- It has to make a sizzling sound. - Right.

1083
00:43:17,906 --> 00:43:20,044
I remember that clearly.

1084
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:21,305
We've seen stuff.

1085
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:23,115
Right. I've seen it over their shoulders.

1086
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:25,476
(They finally decide to make jeon.)

1087
00:43:26,346 --> 00:43:28,315
I'm so relieved you are here.

1088
00:43:28,746 --> 00:43:30,085
Put your finger on it.

1089
00:43:30,656 --> 00:43:31,656
Is that...

1090
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:34,156
on Variety Show 101?

1091
00:43:34,556 --> 00:43:36,294
When it makes a sizzling sound, you're good.

1092
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:37,295
(A pro's demonstration)

1093
00:43:37,296 --> 00:43:39,365
- What? - He wants me to touch it.

1094
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,425
No.

1095
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:43,334
- Yes. I got it. - What is it?

1096
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:45,595
- Right. I remember something. - What?

1097
00:43:45,596 --> 00:43:47,504
- I saw it on YouTube. - Okay. Let's see.

1098
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:48,806
- I'll try it now. - Okay.

1099
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:51,274
- She remembers it now. - What I should do is...

1100
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:53,246
add the solid ingredients first.

1101
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:56,144
- Gosh. - Gosh. It sounds right.

1102
00:43:56,145 --> 00:43:57,275
- Yes. - This is the right sound.

1103
00:43:57,675 --> 00:43:59,584
- Add more quickly. - Goodness.

1104
00:43:59,585 --> 00:44:01,685
- Hurry. - Hold on. My goodness.

1105
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:03,916
Don't do that. You're making me nervous.

1106
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:06,055
- That's right. - So I did this.

1107
00:44:06,056 --> 00:44:08,525
What do I do after that? I don't add more.

1108
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:11,254
- I add the soup on top of it. - Just the soup?

1109
00:44:11,255 --> 00:44:12,464
- They did something like this. - Yes.

1110
00:44:12,465 --> 00:44:14,226
- Nice. - It holds them together.

1111
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:16,794
I think I saw it in the historical drama.

1112
00:44:16,795 --> 00:44:18,765
- Yes. - Something like this.

1113
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:19,835
That's the vibe.

1114
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:21,536
It smells awesome.

1115
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:23,535
It's amazing right now.

1116
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,504
I want it to be crispy. You know what I mean?

1117
00:44:25,505 --> 00:44:27,675
- Okay. - Crispy on the outside.

1118
00:44:27,906 --> 00:44:29,375
Will we be able to make it crispy?

1119
00:44:30,775 --> 00:44:32,214
- Are they making it? - Yes.

1120
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:34,084
It smells awesome. Did you put seafood in it?

1121
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:36,715
- Yes. - We put the seafood in.

1122
00:44:37,355 --> 00:44:38,515
What if it tears apart?

1123
00:44:38,516 --> 00:44:40,186
No. It's tearing apart already.

1124
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:41,485
Spin it.

1125
00:44:42,355 --> 00:44:44,956
(They spin it for some reason.)

1126
00:44:46,496 --> 00:44:47,525
Oh, dear.

1127
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,709
What if it tears apart?

1128
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,380
No. It's tearing apart already.

1129
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:52,579
Spin it.

1130
00:44:53,479 --> 00:44:56,050
(They spin it for some reason.)

1131
00:44:57,749 --> 00:44:58,819
Oh, dear.

1132
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,058
(Did he flip it?)

1133
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:01,090
Tae Hyun.

1134
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:04,129
Oh, dear.

1135
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,489
(It's sort of flipped.)

1136
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,559
Tae Hyun.

1137
00:45:06,729 --> 00:45:08,130
(Is it a rolled omelet?)

1138
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,698
(They failed.)

1139
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:10,800
Gosh. You failed.

1140
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,499
Let's try it again.

1141
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,739
Put them together with a glue.

1142
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,509
The batter is the glue.

1143
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,809
(He tries to spread it out.)

1144
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,879
No.

1145
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,978
(It's totally ragged.)

1146
00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:24,979
What should I do?

1147
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,320
(Laughing)

1148
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,078
It smells fantastic, though.

1149
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,650
What happened?

1150
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:30,690
(It smells so good, though. What happened?)

1151
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:33,019
It's broken.

1152
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,959
- Put in a lot of chives... - Forget about this one.

1153
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,759
- and just... - In here?

1154
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,428
- This one's done. - No, this one's done. This...

1155
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:43,099
- We can't fix this one? - We'll just have to eat it as is.

1156
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,269
- Yes. - Okay.

1157
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,499
(Jung Ah is done filling the chickens.)

1158
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,769
This is ready.

1159
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,940
- Did you flip these? - Right.

1160
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,010
(Steam is coming up.)

1161
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,308
(Meanwhile, the sweet corns have nicely boiled.)

1162
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:01,220
- They smell like sweet potatoes. - That should be enough.

1163
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,649
- We should now... - Let it sit.

1164
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,720
- let it sit. - Yes.

1165
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,658
And I'll put the samgyetang here.

1166
00:46:08,659 --> 00:46:09,728
(It's time to make samgyetang.)

1167
00:46:09,729 --> 00:46:12,059
(Generous Jung Ah appears.)

1168
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:15,159
Pour enough water and put it here please.

1169
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,499
Done. It's ready for you, Jung Ah.

1170
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:19,199
Are you putting the chickens in?

1171
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,369
Gosh, throw them in.

1172
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,479
(They throw in the chickens into the boiling water.)

1173
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,809
Their legs are crossed so nicely.

1174
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,150
They look chic.

1175
00:46:31,909 --> 00:46:32,920
The green onions.

1176
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,780
(She throws in garlic cloves too.)

1177
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:41,059
(She toughly puts in whole green onions.)

1178
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,859
You'll see a bag of medicinal herbs in the fridge.

1179
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,889
- Medicinal herbs? - Yes.

1180
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:48,729
- You want us to add these in? - Do we have cheesecloth bags?

1181
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,369
- Yes, put them in there. - Yes.

1182
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,399
Gosh, look at this.

1183
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,570
- This is great. - Here, take this.

1184
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,669
The more of these we use, the better it'll taste.

1185
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:56,670
They're good for health.

1186
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:00,138
(Medicinal herbs like Kalopanax, Astragalus, ginseng and jujube...)

1187
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:01,579
(are put in a cheesecloth bag.)

1188
00:47:03,479 --> 00:47:05,379
(Welcome)

1189
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,720
(In goes the bag with the chickens.)

1190
00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:09,720
This is going to make the samgyetang so delicious.

1191
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,189
It's basically a tonic.

1192
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,719
It's unbelievable how much medicinal herbs we're using.

1193
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,989
(Just the sight of it makes her proud.)

1194
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,030
Goodness.

1195
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,960
The smell is already...

1196
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:20,799
Gosh, smell it. Goodness.

1197
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,800
(The scent of the medicinal herbs fills the yard.)

1198
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:23,030
Unbelievable. Gosh.

1199
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:28,099
I'll make the fire stronger. We have to eat soon.

1200
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:30,340
Stronger fire.

1201
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:35,539
(The human gas stove made the fire stronger.)

1202
00:47:36,409 --> 00:47:38,249
(While the samgyetang is cooking...)

1203
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,518
I'll do better this time.

1204
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:42,720
Let me make another attempt. I think I got it.

1205
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,018
- Tae Hyun. - So like...

1206
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:45,919
- What? What's going on? - I'm going to flip it.

1207
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,289
Okay. Go.

1208
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,928
(She takes a deep breath.)

1209
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:51,030
You're going to let it burn. Hurry.

1210
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:53,659
- Gosh. - Okay.

1211
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,960
(Did she succeed?)

1212
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:56,229
- Gosh. - Okay.

1213
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,268
(She successfully made a clean flip this time.)

1214
00:47:58,269 --> 00:48:00,799
- You did it. - I did it.

1215
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,470
(The cooking newbies' triumph)

1216
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,539
Okay. Hey, this is...

1217
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:09,880
- This is picture perfect. - This one is dinner-table worthy.

1218
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:12,150
- I should go set up the table. - You did it.

1219
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,320
Gosh, our corns. I have to take them out.

1220
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:18,650
The corns? I'll take them out.

1221
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:21,559
- We have corns. - Yes.

1222
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:23,689
We'll put it here.

1223
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,459
(Let's watch this mouth-watering footage for a second.)

1224
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,460
Here.

1225
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,098
(The corns look warm and delicious.)

1226
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:31,300
These smell so nice.

1227
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:33,399
- The corns were so delicious. - Right.

1228
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,599
Jun Myun, come try one real quick.

1229
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,170
- Eat what? - To see if it's cooked nicely.

1230
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,470
It's hot.

1231
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:39,610
This is as hot as a steel furnace right now.

1232
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,408
I'll try one.

1233
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:42,409
(He can't say no to corn no matter how hot it is.)

1234
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,880
This smells amazing.

1235
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,880
Is it cooked nicely?

1236
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,489
Is it fully cooked?

1237
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,050
- It's cooked. - They smell amazing.

1238
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,058
- Isn't the corn great? - Totally.

1239
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:55,659
I fell in love when I had it in the morning.

1240
00:48:56,929 --> 00:48:58,860
- It looks so delicious. - It really is.

1241
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,928
It's seasoned perfectly.

1242
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:01,929
(She's proud.)

1243
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,829
It was so delicious when I had it at the restaurant.

1244
00:49:05,329 --> 00:49:06,900
Gosh, they look so delicious.

1245
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,999
Try one. He said it was delicious.

1246
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,369
(Eating)

1247
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,908
This is insane.

1248
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:13,909
(The corn is insanely good.)

1249
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:15,979
Gosh, this is insane.

1250
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,010
(Tae Hyun takes a bite too.)

1251
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,649
(They're having a sweet time preparing for dinner, )

1252
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,849
(thanks to the Goseong corns.)

1253
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,349
I love famine crops.

1254
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,760
What are you going to do with the rest of the corns?

1255
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:31,189
I want to make canned corn.

1256
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:32,260
I see.

1257
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,328
I need to stop eating, but I can't.

1258
00:49:35,329 --> 00:49:37,170
(He can't, either.)

1259
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:40,470
I think we work well together, Tae Hyun. How's tomorrow?

1260
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,638
(Laughing)

1261
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:44,409
- You're very clingy, aren't you? - Yes.

1262
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:46,979
Those to have gotten close so quickly.

1263
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,380
Totally.

1264
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:50,010
- I think we work so well together. - Yes.

1265
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,748
I think we can take this out.

1266
00:49:51,749 --> 00:49:53,920
- Wait. Let me taste it first. - Okay.

1267
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:57,090
Gosh, the smell. I smell medicinal herbs.

1268
00:49:57,889 --> 00:49:58,919
This is great.

1269
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,659
(Samgyetang with traditional medicinal herbs...)

1270
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,530
(and Yum Jang Geum, the cooking legend)

1271
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,760
It's seasoned perfectly.

1272
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,229
(Yum Jang Geum created this Korean medicinal corn samgyetang.)

1273
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:12,099
The ladle. Put it in here.

1274
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,539
- Here? - Yes. No.

1275
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,369
(In this small bowl?)

1276
00:50:16,869 --> 00:50:17,869
No, use it for the soup.

1277
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,639
(The soup, not the ladle.)

1278
00:50:19,979 --> 00:50:21,009
The soup.

1279
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,210
(He pours the soup, not the ladle, into the bowl.)

1280
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:25,848
(The samgyetang broth is nice and white.)

1281
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:27,118
It's hot.

1282
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,720
(The samgyetang broth is nice and white.)

1283
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:35,360
(Generous Jung Ah made sure they all each get a whole chicken.)

1284
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,929
- This is great. - We each get a whole chicken.

1285
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:40,799
This is the last bowl.

1286
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,429
- It smells great. - The foods take up a lot of space.

1287
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,769
Gosh, today's dinner is...

1288
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:47,598
- Gosh. - so hearty.

1289
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,169
(The table is too crowded with the feast.)

1290
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,769
You're such a great cook, Jung Ah. You even made samgyetang.

1291
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:53,709
I'm curious about the corn in the soup.

1292
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:56,880
- Right. I wonder how it'll taste. - How the corn turned out.

1293
00:50:57,309 --> 00:51:00,519
Gosh, I'm curious...

1294
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,948
about how the ingredients are.

1295
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:04,619
(Jung Ah's samgyetang with the corns of Goseong)

1296
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,360
The green onion kimchi is amazing.

1297
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,959
Jun Myun's green onion kimchi.

1298
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,960
(Sauce Park's spicy, sweet, and sour green onion kimchi)

1299
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:13,629
This familiar taste. It's going to be delicious.

1300
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,369
(The dried shrimp and chive pancake Tae Hyun and Eun Jin struggled with)

1301
00:51:18,269 --> 00:51:21,099
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1302
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,039
(He tries the samgyetang, which he's the most curious about.)

1303
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,479
Gosh, this is delicious.

1304
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:29,649
(Just one bite of samgyetang is fueling them with energy.)

1305
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:30,709
Gosh.

1306
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,679
(Just one bite of samgyetang is fueling them with energy.)

1307
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,249
How did you tie up the chickens?

1308
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:37,489
- It's... - I crossed their legs and...

1309
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,189
They look so chic. Their legs are crossed perfectly.

1310
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,259
- Untie its legs. - This one looks like...

1311
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,328
- Sharon Stone. - Untie its legs.

1312
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:44,359
(Bursts into laughter)

1313
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,729
- Sharon Stone. - This reminded me of Sharan Stone.

1314
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:48,530
The way its legs are crossed.

1315
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:50,229
Gosh.

1316
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:52,670
(The bone just slid out.)

1317
00:51:54,369 --> 00:51:56,199
- The chicken is perfectly cooked. - Is it?

1318
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,170
The bones just slide out.

1319
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:00,579
(Happy)

1320
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:04,249
This is the perfect protein boost.

1321
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,618
You have to poke holes in it.

1322
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:09,949
(Jun Myun takes a bite of a soft chicken leg.)

1323
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,090
(Eyes wide open)

1324
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:17,659
The soup too.

1325
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,329
- Season it to suit your palate. - It's nicely seasoned.

1326
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:23,530
This broth is like a tonic.

1327
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,599
(The more you drink, the healthier you feel.)

1328
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:30,269
Gosh.

1329
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,539
- It's nicely seasoned. - Season it to suit your palate.

1330
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,909
This broth is like a tonic.

1331
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,280
Gosh.

1332
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,610
- Jung Ah, this is delicious. - I'm glad.

1333
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,719
- We get to eat this on boknal. - Right.

1334
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,720
- Thanks, Jung Ah. - Thank you so much.

1335
00:52:43,721 --> 00:52:45,788
If we weren't for you, we wouldn't have been able to.

1336
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:48,220
We would never have been able to back in Seoul, right?

1337
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,860
- I'm so thankful. - Right.

1338
00:52:49,861 --> 00:52:51,429
I see the corn.

1339
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:53,999
There's corn inside.

1340
00:52:54,499 --> 00:52:55,499
How's the corn?

1341
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,198
(He takes a bite of the corn and glutinous rice inside the chicken.)

1342
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:02,039
- Jung Ah, this is delicious. - I'm glad.

1343
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:04,909
(Savoring)

1344
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:11,679
(Samgyetang with corn is a delicacy he's never had before.)

1345
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,179
This corn is so nice.

1346
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,420
Samgyetang with corn in it is good.

1347
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:20,289
(Jung Ah, who worked hard to make dinner, takes a bite too.)

1348
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:23,228
Do you eat at least one meal a day with your family?

1349
00:53:23,229 --> 00:53:24,260
Yes, at least one.

1350
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,130
No.

1351
00:53:27,229 --> 00:53:29,300
The corn was a stroke of genius, Jung Ah.

1352
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:30,999
It adds a chewy texture.

1353
00:53:31,229 --> 00:53:33,199
Corn is chewy.

1354
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:35,198
It's not soft at all.

1355
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:37,470
- It's chewy. - It's definitely waxy corn.

1356
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,280
- Gosh. You're eating good, Dex. - Yes, it's delicious.

1357
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,079
The corn definitely adds an earth tone to the flavor.

1358
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,578
Totally. It's so nice.

1359
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:48,849
I really want to try making this myself in summer.

1360
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:50,518
The green onion kimchi Jun Myun made.

1361
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:53,490
(Don't forget the green onion kimchi Jun Myun made.)

1362
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,360
Gosh.

1363
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,929
- This is so good. - It's good.

1364
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:01,559
I have to take a bite with Jun Myun's green onion kimchi.

1365
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:06,369
(It's so good.)

1366
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,839
(Sauce Park did it again.)

1367
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,639
Sauce Park, you did it again.

1368
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,908
- The kimchi with the samgyetang... - They go well together, right?

1369
00:54:12,909 --> 00:54:14,079
This is so tasty.

1370
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:16,380
I should try the green onion kimchi too.

1371
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,550
- Isn't it good? - It's so good.

1372
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,880
What?

1373
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,880
It's so good that you'll keep thinking about it.

1374
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:24,589
What? This is great.

1375
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,888
- You like it? - The samgyetang tastes different...

1376
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:27,419
with the kimchi.

1377
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,490
What? This is so delicious.

1378
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:33,029
So this is what green onion kimchi tastes like. Amazing.

1379
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,760
This makes me crave a bowl of white rice.

1380
00:54:36,499 --> 00:54:39,228
This is the first time I'm having green onion kimchi like this.

1381
00:54:39,229 --> 00:54:40,368
- Me too. - I usually don't...

1382
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:41,800
- I usually don't eat it. - eat green onion kimchi.

1383
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,940
- Me neither. - Why not? How is that possible?

1384
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:46,578
I feel too lazy to make it.

1385
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:48,539
I see. It's a hassle for you.

1386
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:51,649
I've only seen it on TV.

1387
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:52,879
(But this is so delicious that it defeats the hassle he feels.)

1388
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,519
- We usually wrap it around. - Right.

1389
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,349
(Mouth open wide)

1390
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:01,090
(He might overcome his laziness and make it himself.)

1391
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,329
- Do you live alone, Dex? - Yes.

1392
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:06,328
Gosh, then Dex must love eating here.

1393
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:08,400
- Homemade meals. - Totally homemade.

1394
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:10,299
That's why he eats a lot here.

1395
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,729
(He gets to enjoy eating food every day here.)

1396
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:13,639
I usually eat delivery food,

1397
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,069
- so I feel alive when I'm here. - Right.

1398
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,139
I understand.

1399
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,280
The jeon. I should have tried the jeon.

1400
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,710
(The person who made the chive jeon suddenly tenses up.)

1401
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,909
- You made this, Eun Jin? - With Tae Hyun.

1402
00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:26,518
Please evaluate it on a positive note.

1403
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:27,919
Why would you drag Tae Hyun into this?

1404
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,379
- I know you made this. - No, Tae Hyun really...

1405
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,219
helped me get the consistency of the batter right.

1406
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,260
(He takes a bite of the chive jeon.)

1407
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,460
It's good.

1408
00:55:34,461 --> 00:55:35,920
(It automatically puts a smile on his face.)

1409
00:55:36,019 --> 00:55:38,059
It's good. You seasoned it well too.

1410
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:40,328
(What a relief.)

1411
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:41,899
- I'm relieved. - You did all right.

1412
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,229
I can cook.

1413
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:45,630
It's good.

1414
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:49,539
(Dex finishes off his big dinner with a beverage.)

1415
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,470
This is going to inspire people to cook.

1416
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:54,979
Soda?

1417
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:57,050
(Refreshing)

1418
00:55:57,249 --> 00:55:59,579
Everything has zero sugar in it these days. That's the trend.

1419
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,780
Right.

1420
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:03,820
(The Fresh off the Sea cast replenished their bodies on boknal.)

1421
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,689
Gosh, it's raining hard.

1422
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,329
(Rain starts to fall.)

1423
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,530
I have to go do that.

1424
00:56:13,729 --> 00:56:15,130
- The fish trap? - The fish trap.

1425
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:17,368
I should take a few fish traps...

1426
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:19,099
and place one at each point.

1427
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:21,399
- Thank you for the food. - Let's go set up the fish traps.

1428
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,010
Yes, we'll clean up in the meantime.

1429
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,240
What's that?

1430
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,748
I thought we should put baits in the traps.

1431
00:56:30,749 --> 00:56:31,749
(Dex prepared a bucket of baits.)

1432
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,720
Gosh, these baits.

1433
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:35,979
- Hey. - Yes?

1434
00:56:36,249 --> 00:56:39,249
What are you trying to catch with these?

1435
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,859
These are scary.

1436
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,030
(A bucket full of chopped fish?)

1437
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:46,089
Are you trying to catch a shark?

1438
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,860
(Sharks would drool at these.)

1439
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,070
The way I see it, the fish traps...

1440
00:56:52,429 --> 00:56:54,800
It looks like you're trying to catch a shark with these.

1441
00:56:55,269 --> 00:56:56,940
Those aren't bait. They're more like...

1442
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,570
I want to put in a lot of them,

1443
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,780
so we can catch a lot of fish.

1444
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,510
I feel like there won't be any space left in the traps.

1445
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:04,380
I'm just trying to use up all the baits we have.

1446
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:06,720
I'll fill this one halfway.

1447
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,690
That's it. Isn't that too much?

1448
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:12,949
The smell of blood will...

1449
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,829
This is amazing. I've never seen this kind of bait.

1450
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,860
- Let's go. - All right.

1451
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:20,800
The water is high now.

1452
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:24,329
Right. It wasn't earlier.

1453
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,598
(The water that had left the harbor...)

1454
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:32,139
(has returned in the evening.)

1455
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:35,609
I wonder what kind of fish this place is famous for.

1456
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:36,880
(What kind of sea creature inhabits Goseong's ocean at night?)

1457
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,519
(Japanese halfbeak)

1458
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:44,320
(Stone crab)

1459
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:48,220
(Sea snail)

1460
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,058
(A variety of sea creatures live in Goseong's ocean.)

1461
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:54,599
- This place is... - The fish...

1462
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,469
- Will we be able to catch any fish? - Are there any fish at all?

1463
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:58,599
(What kind of sea creatures will they meet this time?)

1464
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:00,300
- Is this the end? - Yes.

1465
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,498
- The way I see it, we can... - I think this is it.

1466
00:58:01,499 --> 00:58:02,638
Set the traps here.

1467
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:04,638
It's quiet and nice here.

1468
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:05,840
The water doesn't leave here.

1469
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:07,939
Right here.

1470
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,110
(They set up the fish traps at the end of the harbor.)

1471
00:58:09,979 --> 00:58:11,349
Are you sure we'll actually catch fish?

1472
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:14,050
How do we set up the fish traps?

1473
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:16,478
Just put baits inside?

1474
00:58:16,479 --> 00:58:18,949
Lower them into the points you chose and secure them.

1475
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,619
(Once the fish that's been lured by the baits enter the trap, )

1476
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,999
(they can't get out easily through the narrow opening.)

1477
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,029
They get to have a feast while they're trapped.

1478
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:33,539
(They move around like this inside the fish trap.)

1479
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,340
The fish will get to eat the bait.

1480
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,869
We have to untie the rope first.

1481
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,638
The way you tie the rope...

1482
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:44,909
looks different since you were in the Navy.

1483
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:48,419
Most people would just tie it once.

1484
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,319
Yes. All right, I'm going to throw it now.

1485
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,320
Okay.

1486
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,158
(I am...)

1487
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:57,559
(Dex, former Navy.)

1488
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,989
(Incredible)

1489
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,099
I did it.

1490
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,329
- You threw it perfectly. - It landed at the point.

1491
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:08,170
(Dex threw the fish trap so strongly that it flew right to the point.)

1492
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:10,209
- Nice. - Nice.

1493
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,339
(Dex is definitely the strongest member of Fresh off the Sea.)

1494
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,340
- All right. - You...

1495
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:15,840
You got a following shot of the fish trap, right?

1496
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,280
Gosh.

1497
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,049
(Following shot: a shot in which the camera continuously follows...)

1498
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,118
(a person or an object's movements)

1499
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:21,479
No one took a following shot of the fish trap?

1500
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:23,550
What are you doing?

1501
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:27,519
Goodness. You should have taken it.

1502
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:31,229
- I respect Tae Hyun so much. - You should have taken the shot.

1503
00:59:31,889 --> 00:59:34,260
- You had the light aimed at me. - It's for the following shot.

1504
00:59:36,729 --> 00:59:38,400
- When are you going to throw it? - Now.

1505
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:44,539
(Thanks to Tae Hyun perfectly moving the lighting, )

1506
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:45,970
Nice.

1507
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:51,150
(they successfully took a following shot of the fish trap.)

1508
00:59:51,479 --> 00:59:52,908
- That was good. - It was good?

1509
00:59:52,909 --> 00:59:54,619
- Yes. - All right.

1510
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,090
A great catch will be waiting for us tomorrow.

1511
00:59:58,519 --> 00:59:59,948
- I look forward to... - Fish that are this big.

1512
00:59:59,949 --> 01:00:00,959
(He's full of expectations.)

1513
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,019
seeing what the fish traps caught.

1514
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,590
Nice and clean.

1515
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:09,030
I'm really curious about today's episode.

1516
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,800
I always am.

1517
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,800
I'm even more curious, so it's...

1518
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,970
- Making you anxious? - Yes, I'm curious.

1519
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,209
They were marketing a lot of you...

1520
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,669
and Dex's competition of going into the water.

1521
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:20,309
Right. That too.

1522
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:23,710
- Our show airs today at 8:40pm. - Right.

1523
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,610
We'll be able to watch our show today together.

1524
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:28,518
Jung Ah, Fresh off the Sea airs today.

1525
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:30,550
Right. It airs today.

1526
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:33,119
It's going to be so fun.

1527
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,989
Right, I wonder how it will be.

1528
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,319
We've never seen the episode before.

1529
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,329
Right.

1530
01:00:37,789 --> 01:00:39,829
Jun Myun, should we put it on?

1531
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:41,760
Okay, let's put it on.

1532
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:46,939
(Full of excitement)

1533
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,239
Jun Myun, what number is the channel? Is it 15 or 3?

1534
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,269
Three.

1535
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:54,078
(As soon as the show is on, they see the kabocha harvest with Jung Min.)

1536
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,240
Jun Myun, we were so exhausted back then.

1537
01:00:57,579 --> 01:00:58,710
Look, it's Jung Min.

1538
01:00:59,979 --> 01:01:02,220
Gosh. Yes, harvesting the kabocha was so exhausting.

1539
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,118
It really was.

1540
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,720
(At the sound of their show, Jung Ah gets up from relaxing.)

1541
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,618
(Moving around)

1542
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:11,729
- Jung Ah. - Jung Ah, we put the show on.

1543
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:15,799
The two of them went to set up the fish traps.

1544
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,800
Those two...

1545
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:19,498
(Jung Ah joined them.)

1546
01:01:19,499 --> 01:01:21,599
Do you know how to clean freshly caught fish?

1547
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:23,269
- More or less. - Gosh.

1548
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:24,868
- Did you do it? - Yes.

1549
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:26,209
- Did you set them up? - Yes, we threw the fish traps.

1550
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,679
- You did? Good job. - Yes.

1551
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,880
Gosh.

1552
01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:30,809
Hey, we ended up watching it.

1553
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,150
(Eventually, they're all watching the show together.)

1554
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:35,320
It's so delicious.

1555
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:42,860
(They're focused on the show since they've been waiting all day.)

1556
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:50,159
(Jung Min preparing ingredients)

1557
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,198
When did he do all that?

1558
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:54,269
Right, I didn't know that.

1559
01:01:54,769 --> 01:01:56,440
He never sits still.

1560
01:01:56,909 --> 01:01:58,309
He's like Jung Ah in that way.

1561
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,478
Where did you and I go?

1562
01:02:00,479 --> 01:02:01,509
Right. What were we doing?

1563
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:02,709
- We went out to the sea. - No, you were at the sea.

1564
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:04,010
The two of you were at the sea.

1565
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:06,050
The water looked so pretty.

1566
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,018
I know. The weather was perfect.

1567
01:02:08,019 --> 01:02:09,019
(Eun Jin and Dex were admiring the sea on their bikes.)

1568
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:10,820
(Focused)

1569
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,920
You were riding pretty fast without me on the back.

1570
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:15,760
Gosh, Jun Myun.

1571
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:18,090
I'll ride even faster with you on the back next time.

1572
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,529
("My son is the most handsome in the world.")

1573
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:22,860
- We were playing a game. - Okay.

1574
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,829
Your father was too funny.

1575
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,170
Dad!

1576
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,400
("Hey, Dex!")

1577
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,970
(His father calls him Dex instead of his real name, Jin Young.)

1578
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,380
When did your father start calling you Dex?

1579
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,478
When I started using the name Dex.

1580
01:02:37,479 --> 01:02:38,909
That's how my dad usually is.

1581
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,448
("My son is the best")

1582
01:02:41,449 --> 01:02:42,849
You're so close with your father.

1583
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:45,949
Goodness.

1584
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,820
Watching Dex and Eun Jin, I think to myself,

1585
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:52,929
"How did their parents nurture them into such good people?"

1586
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,859
- The kids? - The kids. What did they do...

1587
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,969
to nurture them like that?

1588
01:02:56,970 --> 01:03:00,169
They're so nice and...

1589
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:01,400
(Tae Hyun thinks highly of the youngest siblings.)

1590
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:02,670
(Mom)

1591
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,740
(Dad)

1592
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:06,609
- In such a short period of time, - You did a lot of things.

1593
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,309
You got a lot on camera.

1594
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:09,780
They got a lot on camera.

1595
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,880
That was fun.

1596
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,978
- That was nice. - Mattresses...

1597
01:03:13,979 --> 01:03:15,780
- That's how they made one episode. - It's probably over.

1598
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,348
- It's over? - It's over.

1599
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:18,420
Gosh.

1600
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,819
It's over.

1601
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,260
Gosh, it's over.

1602
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,689
The re-run starts at midnight.

1603
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,760
You want to watch the re-run?

1604
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:26,889
- Midnight? - I want to see the part we missed.

1605
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,598
- Aren't you going to watch? - Of course, I'm going to watch.

1606
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:30,970
(That goes without saying.)

1607
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:32,970
- At midnight? - We'll be tired.

1608
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,900
When the sun comes up, the sun will be on us directly like we said.

1609
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,678
(This morning, they found out that they'll be catching pike eels.)

1610
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:42,909
(What are we going to do?)

1611
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,049
(In the afternoon, )

1612
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:48,449
(they'll be going in teams of two.)

1613
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,618
(Not in the morning...)

1614
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:54,320
(and separated into two teams?)

1615
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,019
Let's decide the teams.

1616
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,490
What game should we play?

1617
01:03:58,590 --> 01:03:59,629
How do you want to do this?

1618
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:00,859
(They play a game to divide into teams as they wait for the re-run.)

1619
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,259
Hand-flipping?

1620
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:04,570
- Something fun. - Something we can play once.

1621
01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:07,570
Something that divides us by what we're thinking.

1622
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:08,768
Then maybe we should...

1623
01:04:08,769 --> 01:04:09,939
(Thinking)

1624
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,269
Bong Joon Ho or Park Chan Wook?

1625
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:12,939
(How can we choose between them?)

1626
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,439
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1627
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,609
- Bong Joon Ho. - Bong Joon Ho.

1628
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:17,880
Goodness.

1629
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,709
All four of us chose Bong Joon Ho?

1630
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:20,719
(Oh, no)

1631
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,720
Gosh.

1632
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:23,219
I even worked with Director Park Chan Wook before.

1633
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,220
I'm sorry.

1634
01:04:24,221 --> 01:04:25,590
(I respect you, Director Park Chan Wook.)

1635
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:28,388
Gosh. We can't divide ourselves into teams of two.

1636
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:29,919
This is so hard.

1637
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,030
(How can all four of them make the same choice?)

1638
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:33,130
Or what about this?

1639
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:36,499
Song Kang Ho or Choi Min Sik?

1640
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,939
- One, two, three. - Oh, no.

1641
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,670
- Song Kang Ho. - Choi Min Sik.

1642
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,138
- Yes. - We did it.

1643
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:48,578
(They finally succeeded.)

1644
01:04:48,579 --> 01:04:49,610
- We did it. - Jun Myun.

1645
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:51,348
Are we done?

1646
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:52,650
Yes, we did it.

1647
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,019
(Tomorrow's teams for catching pike eels)

1648
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,819
(Jung Ah and Eun Jin)

1649
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:58,549
(Jun Myun and Dex)

1650
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,619
Gosh, that was fun.

1651
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:02,220
My heart was beating so fast.

1652
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,489
Tae Hyun, you should go shower first.

1653
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:05,490
- Me? - Yes.

1654
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:13,069
(Late into the night, )

1655
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:16,039
(only the sound of grass bugs can be heard in Garyong Village.)

1656
01:05:21,139 --> 01:05:22,380
- Eun Jin. Honestly, it's not you. - Gosh.

1657
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:25,049
(The Fresh off the Sea cast wait up for the re-run.)

1658
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,449
What happened?

1659
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,248
Tae Hyun, before you leave,

1660
01:05:28,249 --> 01:05:30,449
we have to see you perform "I Love You."

1661
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:34,019
(Flustered)

1662
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:36,018
"I love you." This one?

1663
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:37,130
- Yes. - Position's song?

1664
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:41,659
(No. It's this one.)

1665
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:43,629
(Humming)

1666
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:45,098
This one. It's Tae Hyun's song.

1667
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:48,039
- I know that song. - You do, right?

1668
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,439
- I sang that one. - Really?

1669
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,169
Our variety shows always...

1670
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,879
Dex. Why did you bring that book again?

1671
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,908
- What are you doing? - What's wrong with you?

1672
01:05:56,909 --> 01:05:59,009
No. It isn't for a show.

1673
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:00,010
(A familiar book on the floor in Dex's room)

1674
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,050
(He always carried around a book since the first shoot.)

1675
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:06,820
(What's with that setup of you carrying around a book?)

1676
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:10,119
(He read until page 10. Did he read more?)

1677
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,658
(What are you saying?)

1678
01:06:11,659 --> 01:06:13,190
(Page 10)

1679
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:16,829
(Two months ago, he stopped reading the book on page 10.)

1680
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:19,169
- It's the same book. - What page are you at now?

1681
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:20,740
- I'm getting scared now. - Page ten.

1682
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:23,098
- You're amazing. - He's scaring me.

1683
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:24,439
Carry around a thinner book instead.

1684
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,738
- That book isn't heavy. - Gosh.

1685
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:29,179
- You're unbelievable. - Just the fact that...

1686
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,648
I'm carrying around that book with me,

1687
01:06:31,649 --> 01:06:33,449
shows that I'm...

1688
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:35,980
someone who has the possibility to improve.

1689
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,489
I think that to myself.

1690
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,890
Gosh. What's wrong with him?

1691
01:06:40,149 --> 01:06:42,889
- It's 12:10am. What should we do? - Gosh.

1692
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:44,760
That means it already started.

1693
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,288
I think it just started.

1694
01:06:46,289 --> 01:06:47,630
Right.

1695
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:49,898
- Should I turn it up a bit more? - Yes.

1696
01:06:49,899 --> 01:06:52,899
(Focused)

1697
01:06:55,539 --> 01:06:56,898
It shows the previous episode too.

1698
01:06:56,899 --> 01:06:58,869
Right. It's connected with the previous episode.

1699
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,438
(The fried anchovies they had on the first day appears.)

1700
01:07:01,439 --> 01:07:02,710
This was really good.

1701
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,710
- It was seasoned well. - Right.

1702
01:07:04,711 --> 01:07:06,849
- The batter was really good. - Right.

1703
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,119
I made this at home too.

1704
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:09,979
My husband loved it.

1705
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,249
- Really? - He said it was good.

1706
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:14,289
(Aren't you more comfortable with sisters than brothers?)

1707
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,719
Weren't you forcing him with one answer?

1708
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,489
(Weren't you forcing him with one answer?)

1709
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:21,158
(Tell us what our charms are.)

1710
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:23,459
- Gosh, we were harsh on him. - We were giving him a hard time.

1711
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,629
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1712
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:26,230
I'm sorry. I will never be like that again.

1713
01:07:26,399 --> 01:07:28,840
I'm sorry. I won't be like that.

1714
01:07:29,399 --> 01:07:30,839
I really decided to be nice to you...

1715
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,439
after watching the first episode.

1716
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,209
He has to deal with three extreme sisters.

1717
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,249
Right. He has to deal with us.

1718
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,919
(If you're all ready, )

1719
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,749
(let's exercise.)

1720
01:07:43,989 --> 01:07:45,619
Hey, we have to do the National Exercise in the morning.

1721
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:47,520
- We should. - Right.

1722
01:07:50,659 --> 01:07:52,028
(Confused)

1723
01:07:52,029 --> 01:07:54,230
- We have to do that? - Yes.

1724
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,399
- We have to do it. - We must do it 100 percent.

1725
01:07:56,829 --> 01:07:57,829
- You do this every day? - Yes.

1726
01:07:57,830 --> 01:08:00,399
- Jung Ah made this rule. - Jung Min did it too.

1727
01:08:03,499 --> 01:08:06,670
(The National Exercise all of a sudden?)

1728
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:09,310
Jung Ah looks hilarious when she does this.

1729
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,849
Don't be looking at me.

1730
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,248
I love watching you do it the most.

1731
01:08:13,249 --> 01:08:14,979
I do everything else well, but it's just that one move.

1732
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,979
Do you know why I'm in this show?

1733
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,020
I'm here to watch you do that.

1734
01:08:19,949 --> 01:08:20,988
It's Jung Ah!

1735
01:08:20,989 --> 01:08:23,020
(The No-Rhythm Park part)

1736
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,529
(No-Rhythm Park messes around with the rhythm.)

1737
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,868
I'm going to be perfect with it someday and scare you all.

1738
01:08:31,869 --> 01:08:32,999
Gosh.

1739
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:35,399
I think that will really shock me.

1740
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:39,038
We'll do it at 8:10am.

1741
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,039
Okay.

1742
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,778
What's this?

1743
01:08:41,779 --> 01:08:46,449
(The siblings focused on the show for a while.)

1744
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:51,148
Are you all not going to sleep? It's 1:30am.

1745
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:53,219
- Let's sleep. - You should all go to sleep.

1746
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,460
- Let's do the exercise together. - Okay.

1747
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,129
- Good night, Tae Hyun. - Good night.

1748
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,959
- See you tomorrow! - Bye!

1749
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,930
- Good night. - Good night.

1750
01:09:02,829 --> 01:09:04,998
- Let's clean up now. - Let's clean up.

1751
01:09:04,999 --> 01:09:06,730
We have another day ahead of us.

1752
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:09,840
- Turn the lights off, Eun Jin. - Okay.

1753
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:18,649
(Another day's worth of memories have been made.)

1754
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:26,949
(In the picturesque view made by nature, )

1755
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:32,989
(a diligent morning begins with the sea.)

1756
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:42,999
(The peaceful second day with the blue sea in Goseong)

1757
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,180
(Wriggling)

1758
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:53,210
(She gets up at once.)

1759
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:58,189
(Jung Ah is the most diligent one again today as expected.)

1760
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,249
Gosh.

1761
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,020
You can sleep more.

1762
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,759
- Are you already up? - I got up early.

1763
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,989
- Why? - I usually get up early.

1764
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:10,630
I always get up early at home. Sleep some more.

1765
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:13,300
(Patting)

1766
01:10:13,529 --> 01:10:15,599
- What time is it? - You can sleep more.

1767
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,640
(The younger ones should sleep more.)

1768
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:18,869
I'll wash up.

1769
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:24,310
(Ant Jung Ah never gets lazy.)

1770
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:28,349
We still have some time left.

1771
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,649
Gosh, why are you so cute?

1772
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:31,289
(Laughing)

1773
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,989
You're so cute.

1774
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:35,289
You're even cuter.

1775
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,430
(They're calling each other cute while lying down.)

1776
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,199
I really don't want to wash up.

1777
01:10:43,899 --> 01:10:44,970
Don't wash up then.

1778
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:49,039
- I'll be sweating again anyway. - Right.

1779
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:52,109
It feels better after getting some sleep.

1780
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:53,409
- Does it? - Yes.

1781
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:54,979
(Blank)

1782
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,480
- I'll be sweating anyway. - Right.

1783
01:10:57,749 --> 01:10:59,948
- We'll wash up after work. - You can wash up after work.

1784
01:10:59,949 --> 01:11:01,149
That could be better.

1785
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,688
(However, I'm going to wash up.)

1786
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:07,289
(Is Dex still asleep?)

1787
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,059
(He's still in dreamland.)

1788
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,129
(Clicking)

1789
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,130
(Clicking)

1790
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:15,230
(I can't resist cute moments like these.)

1791
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,300
(The guest room at the same time)

1792
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:20,629
(The sunlight sinks in.)

1793
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:22,140
(Blinking)

1794
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:27,438
(Tae Hyun wakes up too.)

1795
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:29,480
(Or is he not up yet?)

1796
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:36,720
(Is he stretching?)

1797
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,449
(Or is he praying?)

1798
01:11:39,949 --> 01:11:42,220
(Is he repenting?)

1799
01:11:42,289 --> 01:11:48,158
(Speed 6 times faster)

1800
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:51,230
(He still manages to get up.)

1801
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:53,999
- Gosh. You're up. - Wasn't the room hot?

1802
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:55,300
No.

1803
01:11:55,499 --> 01:11:57,199
Where is everyone?

1804
01:11:57,399 --> 01:11:58,608
They went to get changed.

1805
01:11:58,609 --> 01:12:00,608
Why did everyone get up so early? They got up at 8am.

1806
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:02,539
I got up early.

1807
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:04,578
They got up early because of me.

1808
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:06,149
Why did I happen to get up early?

1809
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:09,550
(She blames her diligent self.)

1810
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:13,020
(But I must do the morning cleaning.)

1811
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:15,060
(Entrance)

1812
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,020
(Kitchen)

1813
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:18,930
(Low wooden bench)

1814
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:23,199
(Diligent Jung Ah's morning routine)

1815
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,170
(Tae Hyun starts his morning too.)

1816
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:29,039
I think it'll dry up soon.

1817
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:33,039
(He confidently hangs up his underwear.)

1818
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:37,140
(Tae Hyun doesn't even care about the cameras.)

1819
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,649
Dex, let's start our exercise.

1820
01:12:40,749 --> 01:12:42,949
- Everyone, gather up! - Okay.

1821
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:44,749
Get ready, please.

1822
01:12:45,789 --> 01:12:48,358
(The siblings' routine that can't be missed)

1823
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:50,259
- All right. - Let's see.

1824
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,389
(The day begins with the National Exercise.)

1825
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:53,230
- I should connect it. - It's not here, is it?

1826
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,699
(He did come out as he was asked to.)

1827
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,599
(Looking around)

1828
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,770
You'll remember it.

1829
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,499
(Me?)

1830
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:05,909
(Your body will remember how to do the National Exercise.)

1831
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:08,679
(He follows along right from the start.)

1832
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,180
- Great. - You don't even have to look.

1833
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:13,578
(The next one is the neck exercise.)

1834
01:13:13,579 --> 01:13:14,648
Gosh, my neck...

1835
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:16,980
- Gosh! - My neck can't seem to turn.

1836
01:13:17,949 --> 01:13:19,719
- Gosh! - My goodness.

1837
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,089
(The neck exercise makes everyone groan.)

1838
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:22,289
Gosh, this is bad.

1839
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,189
How long has it been for you to do this again?

1840
01:13:26,329 --> 01:13:27,488
(He can't remember.)

1841
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:29,130
It's been a long time.

1842
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:32,270
But I think this is a bit...

1843
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,038
matched to the speed of the younger ones.

1844
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:36,469
- Don't you think so? - No.

1845
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:39,210
- It feels like it's... - It's just the same.

1846
01:13:39,369 --> 01:13:40,809
- It's Jung Ah's time! - sped up by 50 percent.

1847
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:42,380
(It's Jung Ah's time!)

1848
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,179
(Even in Yeongdeok...)

1849
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:46,078
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

1850
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:48,078
(Creaking)

1851
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:49,679
(She can't follow the rhythm.)

1852
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,819
(She never can.)

1853
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,550
(She tries again.)

1854
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:56,119
(However, there still is an error in the rhythm.)

1855
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,029
It's just the same.

1856
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:59,528
It's Jung Ah's time!

1857
01:13:59,529 --> 01:14:00,529
I won't do it...

1858
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:01,659
- if you make fun of me. - Okay.

1859
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:02,929
(Her body reacts to it right away.)

1860
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:04,029
I won't say anything.

1861
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:07,670
(She takes the steps however she wants to.)

1862
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:11,908
(Jumping)

1863
01:14:11,909 --> 01:14:13,670
- Okay. I won't. - What are you doing?

1864
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,309
She keeps making fun of me.

1865
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,538
(It's his first time seeing this move in the exercise.)

1866
01:14:17,539 --> 01:14:18,850
I should stop making fun of her.

1867
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,510
Seven.

1868
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:21,618
(They finish the National Exercise with a smile thanks to her.)

1869
01:14:21,619 --> 01:14:23,550
- Well done. - Let's hurry up and cook.

1870
01:14:24,949 --> 01:14:27,550
(What will Chef Yum prepare for breakfast today?)

1871
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,818
(Last night)

1872
01:14:29,819 --> 01:14:31,489
For breakfast tomorrow,

1873
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:33,089
I'll make gangdoenjang.

1874
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,528
- You're going to make a soup? - Yes.

1875
01:14:34,529 --> 01:14:36,130
I'm going to make the dried pollack soup.

1876
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:37,599
What will we use for wraps?

1877
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,970
I'll braise the pumpkin leaves.

1878
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,499
That sounds good. It'll be refreshing in the morning.

1879
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:43,640
Do you want to make the rolled omelet?

1880
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,769
I'll make the rolled omelet.

1881
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:47,470
It won't look pretty though.

1882
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,680
Just beat the eggs up. I'll cook them.

1883
01:14:49,939 --> 01:14:51,010
Really?

1884
01:14:51,649 --> 01:14:55,220
(A deep taste of the refreshing radish and dried pollack!)

1885
01:14:55,749 --> 01:14:59,149
(The clean dried pollack soup warms you up inside.)

1886
01:15:00,449 --> 01:15:03,789
(A generous amount of vegetables in the egg wash.)

1887
01:15:04,829 --> 01:15:07,760
(The rolled omelet of an extraordinary scale)

1888
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:11,869
(Tender and fragrant pumpkin leaves)

1889
01:15:12,329 --> 01:15:15,569
(The perfect match with savory gangdoenjang)

1890
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:20,609
(The biggest breakfast meal ever is coming soon!)

1891
01:15:21,909 --> 01:15:23,779
Did we not eat these cucumbers yesterday?

1892
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:26,209
- We had a lot of them. - Right. We had a lot.

1893
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:28,049
- We should use them today, right? - Right.

1894
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:30,020
At night. Right.

1895
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,988
We should make sure to use them.

1896
01:15:31,989 --> 01:15:33,819
(The first ingredient in season)

1897
01:15:34,289 --> 01:15:36,789
(Pumpkin leaves that are in season from July to October)

1898
01:15:37,289 --> 01:15:41,859
(It's fresh just on its own, )

1899
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:49,170
(but it's perfect with rice when there's gangdoenjang.)

1900
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:53,170
(For her younger siblings who won't have an appetite in this heat, )

1901
01:15:53,869 --> 01:15:56,578
(she makes pumpkin leaf wraps and gangdoenjang.)

1902
01:15:56,579 --> 01:15:58,649
Do I have to try it?

1903
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:00,050
You should...

1904
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,648
- help me with this. - The stems? I know how to do it.

1905
01:16:02,649 --> 01:16:03,849
- Pull the stems off. - Right.

1906
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:04,890
(Pulling the stems)

1907
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:07,019
(Pulling off the stems of the pumpkin leaves?)

1908
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,090
- Gosh. - I'll do it.

1909
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,659
(After washing the pumpkin leaves carefully, )

1910
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:16,100
(the stems are pulled off.)

1911
01:16:16,329 --> 01:16:18,230
Why are the stems pulled off?

1912
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,630
Because they could feel tough when eaten as wraps.

1913
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:23,899
It's to make them tender. You can eat them without doing this.

1914
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:26,170
(That's amazing.)

1915
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:27,879
(You can enjoy a tender texture when the stems are pulled off.)

1916
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:28,938
Like this.

1917
01:16:28,939 --> 01:16:30,238
(You can enjoy a tender texture when the stems are pulled off.)

1918
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:31,409
They become tender this way.

1919
01:16:32,779 --> 01:16:33,810
Right.

1920
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:36,549
- Gosh. - It's a lot of work.

1921
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,619
(The pumpkin leaf wrap requires effort and care.)

1922
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:39,749
I'm done with them. I can boil them, right?

1923
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:41,390
- I can steam them, right? - You have to steam them.

1924
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,020
Right.

1925
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:47,529
(The stemless pumpkin leaves are steamed in the steamer.)

1926
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,460
We should make the peach jam tomorrow without forgetting.

1927
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,170
- The peachade. - They have to be flipped.

1928
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:55,438
Flip them over and steam them a little bit more.

1929
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:57,139
A little bit more, right?

1930
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:59,608
(The pumpkin leaves are flipped to cook them evenly.)

1931
01:16:59,609 --> 01:17:01,109
- Right. - The pumpkin leaves look good.

1932
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:03,408
(Opening after 10 minutes)

1933
01:17:03,409 --> 01:17:06,550
Set up the plates. I think this can be plated now.

1934
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:11,850
(The pumpkin leaves have become moist and tender.)

1935
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:14,349
(As they are taken out from the steamer, )

1936
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:18,060
(their fragrant smell can be smelled.)

1937
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:20,560
Su.

1938
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,230
(Su?)

1939
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,699
(Su, supernova)

1940
01:17:26,029 --> 01:17:28,038
(The incidents come)

1941
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:30,738
Gosh, she always takes it that far.

1942
01:17:30,739 --> 01:17:32,769
- Ahn Eun Jin. - Gosh, Jun Myun.

1943
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:33,839
My goodness.

1944
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,309
- I can't do anything with you. - You're unbelievable.

1945
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:38,480
- It's great to hear her rap. - I love it.

1946
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,710
(Su, supernova)

1947
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,679
For the rolled omelet,

1948
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:43,680
why don't you put me in charge?

1949
01:17:43,681 --> 01:17:44,688
- I'll give it a try. - Sure.

1950
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:46,749
- Go for it. - I'll make it my way.

1951
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:50,158
I'll place these here. I washed them.

1952
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,329
Are they clean enough? I'll show you!

1953
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:54,389
(She's at the peak of her confidence.)

1954
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:55,399
I can do it too!

1955
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:57,760
I'll make it taste amazing.

1956
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,230
- We're counting on you. - Right.

1957
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:04,369
(Her first individual dish, the rolled omelet)

1958
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:08,579
(She starts shredding the onions and carrots first.)

1959
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,880
Great. I have a good feeling about this.

1960
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:14,510
(She just shredded the vegetables.)

1961
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:17,220
(She already has a good feeling about it?)

1962
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,119
(She uses a generous amount of ingredients like Jung Ah.)

1963
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,288
What are you doing?

1964
01:18:23,289 --> 01:18:25,188
I'm in charge of the rolled omelet.

1965
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:26,260
Oh, right.

1966
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:27,658
(I didn't recognize the chef.)

1967
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:29,999
- Let's do this! - So you're in charge of a dish?

1968
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,470
(Dex is curious too.)

1969
01:18:33,869 --> 01:18:35,439
I'll make the rolled omelet...

1970
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:36,840
Hey, are you not listening to me?

1971
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,569
I'll... I should start over.

1972
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:40,809
I'll make the rolled omelet taste good...

1973
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:42,409
so that you can get your protein.

1974
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:44,239
- You can get your protein. - Okay.

1975
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,909
- Are you not answering me? - Fine.

1976
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:48,079
You have to thank me.

1977
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,319
(The head chef comes over at that moment.)

1978
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,089
(She checks the ingredients.)

1979
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:54,350
(Humming in approval)

1980
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:56,158
You're using a lot of healthy ingredients.

1981
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,289
Yes.

1982
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,489
I'll make even the pickiest eater be able to eat all of it.

1983
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,930
I'll wash them.

1984
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,898
It will still take some time.

1985
01:19:02,899 --> 01:19:03,930
(Jung Ah prepares the vegetables for the gangdoenjang.)

1986
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:07,569
(She slices the shiitake mushroom.)

1987
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:13,939
(She dices up the zucchini for the gangdoenjang.)

1988
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,739
(Jung Ah's care will be added into the savory gangdoenjang.)

1989
01:19:18,779 --> 01:19:21,420
(This will accompany the pumpkin leaf wrap.)

1990
01:19:21,949 --> 01:19:24,789
(It's the dried pollack for the dried pollack soup.)

1991
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,720
(The dried pollack put in water to get soaked)

1992
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,260
(Slicing)

1993
01:19:33,989 --> 01:19:37,029
(They are prepared into bite-sized pieces.)

1994
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,499
Slice me just this much for the gangdoenjang.

1995
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:44,398
Slice some of it to be flat for the dried pollack soup too.

1996
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:46,270
- Okay. In two versions? - Yes.

1997
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,909
(The radishes in Goseong are big.)

1998
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:53,550
(Slicing in cubes for the dried pollack soup)

1999
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:57,649
(An essential ingredient for the refreshing soup)

2000
01:19:58,050 --> 01:19:59,818
- This will be enough, right? - No.

2001
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:01,089
We have that much dried pollack, so we need more.

2002
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:02,220
We need more?

2003
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,630
(Generous Jung Ah's generous dried pollack soup)

2004
01:20:06,289 --> 01:20:08,729
(It's time to stir-fry it in sesame oil.)

2005
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,328
So it's soaked and stir-fried?

2006
01:20:11,329 --> 01:20:12,329
Right.

2007
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:14,869
(All of it goes into the pot.)

2008
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:17,368
You have to get rid of all of its moisture.

2009
01:20:17,369 --> 01:20:18,640
It already smells savory.

2010
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:20,510
It already smells savory.

2011
01:20:20,511 --> 01:20:21,938
(Savory taste)

2012
01:20:21,939 --> 01:20:22,939
I can already smell it.

2013
01:20:23,909 --> 01:20:27,710
(It smells even more savory with the sesame oil!)

2014
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,989
(The attractive smell gets stronger as it gets cooked.)

2015
01:20:33,989 --> 01:20:36,189
This is enough for the radish, right?

2016
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,520
- Yes. - Okay.

2017
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,730
(The radish gets put in.)

2018
01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:43,499
(The soy sauce also goes in.)

2019
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,729
(The taste and scent is more abundant...)

2020
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:49,170
(as the dried pollack and radish meet together.)

2021
01:20:49,869 --> 01:20:53,340
(Water and salted shrimp water gets added.)

2022
01:20:53,909 --> 01:20:57,180
(It will taste great once it boils up.)

2023
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,550
We're done with those then.

2024
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:02,578
Eun Jin won't be able to help us that much today.

2025
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:05,019
She's in charge of a dish on her own now.

2026
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:07,549
I'm so excited for Eun Jin's rolled omelet.

2027
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,789
Be excited for it.

2028
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,158
- But... - She must've tried it before.

2029
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:12,459
- can I... - I haven't.

2030
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:14,560
- Can I give you a tip? - Sure.

2031
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,799
You won't be badmouthing me for giving you a tip, will you?

2032
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,130
Of course not. "What's wrong with her?"

2033
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,140
Add a spoon of sweet rice wine.

2034
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:26,739
But what does the sweet rice wine taste like?

2035
01:21:27,069 --> 01:21:28,210
- What is it? - It's a type of cooking wine.

2036
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:30,879
It will get rid of...

2037
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,249
- the unwanted smell of eggs. - So that's what it's used for.

2038
01:21:33,409 --> 01:21:34,449
- So it's a type of wine. - How many eggs are you using?

2039
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:35,949
I'm not sure. I'm just going with...

2040
01:21:36,579 --> 01:21:37,979
- whatever I feel like. - You have to use at least ten.

2041
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,020
Right.

2042
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:40,220
- Use ten eggs... - Okay.

2043
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:41,460
- and put in two spoons of that. - Got it.

2044
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:43,260
Is it seasoned with salt?

2045
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:44,989
You have to season it with salt.

2046
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:47,029
- If it's ten eggs... - How much do I need?

2047
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:48,929
(It's hard to tell.)

2048
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:49,998
Go with what you feel is right.

2049
01:21:49,999 --> 01:21:52,300
All right, Jun Myun. I'll try to do it my way.

2050
01:21:53,369 --> 01:21:55,939
(She opens 10 eggs.)

2051
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,970
(She puts in the generous amount of vegetables she prepared.)

2052
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,510
I can do it too!

2053
01:22:02,609 --> 01:22:06,680
(She adds two spoons of cooking wine as Jun Myun told her.)

2054
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:10,779
(She seasons it with salt and pepper with her own measurements.)

2055
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:14,649
(It's full of ingredients.)

2056
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:19,159
(She goes for the 1st attempt on the pan with oil.)

2057
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,789
It's hard to make rolled omelets well.

2058
01:22:20,989 --> 01:22:22,460
- I'll try to do my best. - Okay.

2059
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:26,970
(It's time to roll it from the end.)

2060
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:29,739
(Fully focused)

2061
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:32,369
(Cooked well)

2062
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:33,840
It looks nice.

2063
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:34,880
- Really? - Yes.

2064
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:37,409
- Just do it calmly. - Okay. Calmly.

2065
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,350
(She calmly flips it one more time.)

2066
01:22:40,579 --> 01:22:43,079
(But what's wrong with its color?)

2067
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:46,319
(It's slightly burnt.)

2068
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:49,289
(Disappointed)

2069
01:22:49,689 --> 01:22:50,759
Shall we turn down the heat?

2070
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,028
- Oh, right. - It'll burn really quickly.

2071
01:22:52,029 --> 01:22:54,259
- Right. - I'll turn down the heat.

2072
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,729
(Support from the eldest sister after the second sister)

2073
01:22:55,730 --> 01:22:58,799
- Take it nice and slow. - I'll just take it slow.

2074
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,999
- You don't have to rush it. - Right.

2075
01:23:01,069 --> 01:23:02,738
If it's this thick,

2076
01:23:02,739 --> 01:23:04,339
- it'll be hard to cook the insides. - Right.

2077
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:05,868
I think it'll be better to make them thinner.

2078
01:23:05,869 --> 01:23:06,869
Okay.

2079
01:23:07,409 --> 01:23:10,509
If you pull it this way, it'll become thinner.

2080
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:11,909
(The rolled omelet made with the eldest sister's warm advice)

2081
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:16,220
(She spreads it to be thin as she advised her to.)

2082
01:23:16,749 --> 01:23:17,948
(She rolls it one more time!)

2083
01:23:17,949 --> 01:23:20,020
Go! Gosh!

2084
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:22,720
- It's working! - It looks nice.

2085
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,619
(Excited)

2086
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:27,059
(Large)

2087
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,560
I'm doing something!

2088
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,970
(She feels relieved as she rolled it well.)

2089
01:23:33,069 --> 01:23:34,130
It's so hot.

2090
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,869
(Eun Jin's rolled omelet landed safely from the pan.)

2091
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:42,680
It looks amazing, Eun Jin.

2092
01:23:42,739 --> 01:23:43,739
(Amazed)

2093
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:44,840
(Surprised)

2094
01:23:45,409 --> 01:23:48,319
(Thick)

2095
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,379
She added in a lot of vegetables too.

2096
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:53,089
- Gosh, it's as big as a pizza. - Nice one.

2097
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:55,219
- That's great. - It looks nice inside, Eun Jin.

2098
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:56,288
- Really? - You did a great job.

2099
01:23:56,289 --> 01:23:57,318
- You did well. - Plate it up nicely.

2100
01:23:57,319 --> 01:23:58,359
You made this?

2101
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,230
- Put it on a nice plate. - I can do it too!

2102
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:06,899
(Sweet and sour ketchup gets added for the finishing touch!)

2103
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,068
Hey, Jin Young! Can you bring this to the table?

2104
01:24:09,069 --> 01:24:10,238
Sure. You did well.

2105
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,270
(You did well.)

2106
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,310
Say three more things.

2107
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,770
You did well! It looks delicious!

2108
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:16,840
(This feels great.)

2109
01:24:17,109 --> 01:24:19,710
- Eun Jin did a great job today. - Right.

2110
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,278
I'll put it right in the middle.

2111
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:22,619
(It has been given the spot in the middle for the main dish.)

2112
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:26,649
(Another dish is about to be done.)

2113
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:30,060
(Dried pollack soup)

2114
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:34,359
(It gets completed with green onions, chilis, and pepper.)

2115
01:24:34,689 --> 01:24:37,029
It looks really refreshing as it has radish in it too.

2116
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:39,198
Gosh, this is amazing.

2117
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,600
(Refreshing and savory dried pollack soup)

2118
01:24:41,899 --> 01:24:43,469
(The rich flavor of the dried pollack...)

2119
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:45,069
(can be felt from the white soup.)

2120
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,439
It feels like I'm preparing a table of ritual food.

2121
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,840
- The adult always shares the food. - All right.

2122
01:24:51,609 --> 01:24:54,278
- Gosh, it looks delicious! - It feels like a ceremonial table.

2123
01:24:54,279 --> 01:24:55,448
Gosh, you're right.

2124
01:24:55,449 --> 01:24:58,148
- Here. - Have you all got into college?

2125
01:24:58,149 --> 01:24:59,149
- Yes. - Yes.

2126
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,919
Have you been doing well? I'm sorry for not visiting.

2127
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,859
- You guys never came over. - So...

2128
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,028
- Right. - will you give us pocket money...

2129
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:06,029
if we bow to you?

2130
01:25:06,529 --> 01:25:07,529
- Well... - You have to give me a lot...

2131
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:08,559
since I'm an adult.

2132
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,699
I don't have any money.

2133
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,829
Gosh.

2134
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:16,239
(The gangdoenjang is the only dish left.)

2135
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:17,399
It's so hectic.

2136
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:20,140
(Oil gets added to the pan.)

2137

(Two spoons of doenjang)

2139
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:27,408
(The lumps of doenjang and gochujang are stirred.)

2140

(Lowering the heat to medium)

2141
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:34,649
(Savory smell rises over the frying pan.)

2142
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:36,459
Eun Jin, can you add some garlic here?

2143
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,619
Sure, garlic.

2144
01:25:37,789 --> 01:25:40,260
- How many spoons? - A big spoonful.

2145
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,159
Please add all of it.

2146

(You garlic)

2147
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:47,299
(I love you)

2148
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:48,369
(Exclaiming)

2149
01:25:48,739 --> 01:25:50,568
- I'm disappointed by "you garlic." - Jun Myun.

2150
01:25:50,569 --> 01:25:52,738
I'm so disappointed by "you garlic."

2151
01:25:52,739 --> 01:25:54,640
(I find it funny.)

2152
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:56,379
- Are we done? - We did a good job.

2153
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:57,778
Can we serve the food once this is done?

2154
01:25:57,779 --> 01:25:58,779
- Yes. - Yes.

2155
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:59,948
So that's why it smelled like doenjang.

2156
01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:01,608
Amazing.

2157
01:26:01,609 --> 01:26:03,550
(Everything is ready once gangdoenjang is served.)

2158
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:06,749
(She gets impatient for no reason.)

2159

(Stirring right away)

2162
01:26:13,789 --> 01:26:15,060
Is there more?

2163
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:16,430
- What's this? - Gangdoenjang.

2164
01:26:16,529 --> 01:26:19,069
So that's why it smelled like doenjang.

2165
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:21,229
(Drenched in sweat from cooking)

2166
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:23,439
Should I serve the rice? Or not yet?

2167
01:26:23,739 --> 01:26:25,270
No, the vegetables have to be cooked.

2168
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,810
(I'm so busy.)

2169

(Simmering over low heat to cook the vegetables completely)

2175

Jung Ah, it looks delicious.

2176
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,799

- It's great, Jung Ah. - There's some chili,

2192
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:46,489
but it's not spicy at all.

(A combination that drives you crazy if you know it)

2217
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,270
Take more vegetables than doenjang. Otherwise, it's too salty.

2218

01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,430
I'll try what Eun Jin made.

2237
01:29:34,029 --> 01:29:35,029
It's good.

2238
01:29:35,029 --> 01:29:36,029
(Eun Jin's first dish that she made herself)

2239
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:39,068
(Rolled omelet)

2240
01:29:39,069 --> 01:29:40,699
Jung Ah, take a lot of ketchup with it.

2241
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:43,840
(Taking a huge bite)

2242
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:47,069
(What?)

2243
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:48,979
(Nervous)

2244
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:50,078
- It's already seasoned. - Really?

2245
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:51,640
- There's no need for ketchup. - My goodness.

2246
01:29:51,739 --> 01:29:52,948
On top of that, it's delicious.

2247
01:29:52,949 --> 01:29:54,050
- Really? - Okay.

2248
01:29:55,149 --> 01:29:57,720
(Let me try some thick rolled omelet.)

2249
01:29:58,789 --> 01:29:59,789
Isn't it good?

2250
01:29:59,789 --> 01:30:00,789
(In approval)

2251
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:03,358
(The second eldest who gave her some tip takes a bite too.)

2252
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:05,119
Good job, Eun Jin.

2253
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:09,129
(Her first rolled omelet is a huge success.)

2254
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:10,199
It's a familiar taste.

2255
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:13,998
When you order rolled omelet as a drink accompaniment,

2256
01:30:13,999 --> 01:30:16,639
- it's usually very thick. - Right.

2257
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,670
This is exactly like that.

2258
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:19,340
It's all right.

2259
01:30:19,341 --> 01:30:20,608
- Right? - It's delicious.

2260
01:30:20,609 --> 01:30:21,869
- Good job. - You made it well.

2261
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,038
(What a huge relief.)

2262
01:30:24,039 --> 01:30:26,210
- I'm so glad. - It's good.

2263
01:30:26,949 --> 01:30:29,219
Your cooking improves the more you do it.

2264
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,288
I made one rolled omelet while Jung Ah made several dishes.

2265
01:30:32,289 --> 01:30:34,488
That's not important. You should keep cooking at home.

2266
01:30:34,489 --> 01:30:36,019
- I should. - Make things like this.

2267
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:37,220
Especially rolled omelet.

2268
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:39,959
(They fill the table with food that they made together.)

2269
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,230
- The spicy one. - Yes.

2270
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:44,358
(The joy of sharing food)

2271
01:30:44,359 --> 01:30:45,698
Really?

2272
01:30:45,699 --> 01:30:47,999
(The joy of sharing food)

2273
01:30:48,529 --> 01:30:50,368
I always eat so well here.

2274
01:30:50,369 --> 01:30:52,068
(They create another memory together.)

2275
01:30:52,069 --> 01:30:53,139
- That's good. - This much.

2276
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,909
(Refill of dried pollack soup)

2277
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:57,038
Dex, can you give me some more broth?

2278
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,710
- Right? - The broth is incredible, Jung Ah.

2279
01:31:01,609 --> 01:31:02,880
Again today, the sun is...

2280
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:06,249
(The sunlight is incredible too.)

2281
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:08,118
Your face is covered with sweat already.

2282
01:31:08,119 --> 01:31:09,359
I know. It's no joke.

2283
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,020
Of course.

2284
01:31:11,021 --> 01:31:12,529
(Start of the meal, the present)

2285
01:31:13,189 --> 01:31:14,529
Look at the sun.

2286
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:16,599
Gosh, it's going to be intense.

2287
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,560
(It's so bright that it's hard to keep the eyes open.)

2288
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:20,100
Shall we take the table inside?

2289
01:31:20,499 --> 01:31:21,499
Because of the sunlight?

2290
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,170
(Thinking)

2291
01:31:23,539 --> 01:31:25,469
- Let's take the table inside. - Okay.

2292
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:27,569
(In perfect order)

2293
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:32,810
(But we haven't finished yet.)

2294
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:35,380
Excuse me, Tae Hyun.

2295
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,520
(I'm passing by.)

2296
01:31:37,619 --> 01:31:39,648
Tae Hyun. One, two, three.

2297
01:31:39,649 --> 01:31:41,988
He was eating, and we stole it from him.

2298
01:31:41,989 --> 01:31:43,919
(His food disappeared in front of him.)

2299
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,230
- I'm sorry, Tae Hyun. - I was definitely eating.

2300
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:49,159
I definitely took a spoonful.

2301
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:51,800
I was about to take another spoonful.

2302
01:31:53,069 --> 01:31:54,069
The food was gone.

2303
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:55,329
Gosh.

2304
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:56,868
The dining table disappeared.

2305
01:31:56,869 --> 01:31:57,998
(What's going on?)

2306
01:31:57,999 --> 01:31:59,368
(The dining table moved quickly.)

2307
01:31:59,369 --> 01:32:02,609
We act immediately when an order is given.

2308
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:05,310
Otherwise, Jung Ah will scold us.

2309
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:08,608
- Gosh, this is unbelievable. - Come over and finish eating.

2310
01:32:08,609 --> 01:32:10,278
- Finish your food. - Eat where it's cool.

2311
01:32:10,279 --> 01:32:12,590
- Look at this. Quickly... - My goodness.

2312
01:32:12,949 --> 01:32:14,288
(Move over.)

2313
01:32:14,289 --> 01:32:15,858
The sun disappeared quickly.

2314
01:32:15,859 --> 01:32:16,859
(Meanwhile, the sun gets behind the clouds.)

2315
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:19,060
- We're impatient. - Their driving force is incredible.

2316
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:21,289
That's unbelievable.

2317
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:23,600
- Was it too forced? - I feel like I dreamt it.

2318
01:32:25,529 --> 01:32:27,699
- That's hilarious. - I can't believe it.

2319
01:32:27,770 --> 01:32:29,438
It feels so much better inside.

2320
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:30,439
Right.

2321
01:32:31,539 --> 01:32:34,408
Tae Hyun showed it to me on YouTube yesterday.

2322
01:32:34,409 --> 01:32:38,109
There was a tent over a fishing boat for pike eel.

2323
01:32:39,079 --> 01:32:40,480
What were the fishermen wearing?

2324
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:42,648
- They were wearing... - It must be...

2325
01:32:42,649 --> 01:32:45,688
What we wear for fishing is too hot for me.

2326
01:32:45,689 --> 01:32:47,619
You mean the boots and the bodysuit?

2327
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:49,789
Tell me one thing.

2328
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,060
It doesn't take long, does it?

2329
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:53,528
(Is he serious?)

2330
01:32:53,529 --> 01:32:55,328
(Does he want to join us?)

2331
01:32:55,329 --> 01:32:57,529
Jung Ah doesn't look well.

2332
01:32:58,199 --> 01:33:01,129
She's much less energetic than yesterday.

2333
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,140
Right.

2334
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:04,469
It was extremely...

2335
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:06,408
I was very tired from waiting.

2336
01:33:06,409 --> 01:33:09,239
(Jung Ah left the table before everyone else.)

2337
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:13,880
(After exhausting herself during the corn harvest)

2338
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:18,549
(Jung Ah was tired from cooking dinner as well.)

2339
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,448
- Jung Ah must be a bit tired. - It was very hard.

2340
01:33:20,449 --> 01:33:22,019
- Didn't she seem low on energy? - Right.

2341
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,488
- She was very energetic earlier. - Yes.

2342
01:33:23,489 --> 01:33:25,629
- She was... - She must be tired.

2343
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:26,929
Energetic earlier.

2344
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:28,688
It can't be helped because it's so hot.

2345
01:33:28,689 --> 01:33:30,629
- Yes, that's why. - She doesn't seem well.

2346
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:32,369
- She got tired from the heat. - I did.

2347
01:33:33,369 --> 01:33:35,669
My own schedule is less important.

2348
01:33:35,670 --> 01:33:38,270
Jung Ah shouldn't go to work.

2349
01:33:38,499 --> 01:33:40,209
He's really...

2350
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:42,238
- You're amazing. - That's not it.

2351
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:43,879
- You're amazing. - I mean...

2352
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,449
Even if I don't do anything,

2353
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:47,609
I'd like to watch it.

2354
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:49,319
You should come with us.

2355
01:33:49,819 --> 01:33:51,019
Tae Hyun,

2356
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:52,488
- pick which team you want to join. - Right.

2357
01:33:52,489 --> 01:33:54,920
Either me and Jung Ah or these two.

2358
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,559
Shouldn't I join their team?

2359
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:59,028
- Right, a man on each team. - Like this.

2360
01:33:59,029 --> 01:34:00,189
What do you think?

2361
01:34:00,689 --> 01:34:02,089
- Join our team. - Yes,

2362
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:03,459
- join us. - Yes, I should join you.

2363
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:04,460
You're right.

2364
01:34:04,461 --> 01:34:06,569
- Gosh. - I'm so happy that he joined us.

2365
01:34:06,999 --> 01:34:08,300
You're the best, Tae Hyun.

2366
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:10,300
It will be a team of professionals.

2367
01:34:11,539 --> 01:34:14,038
This heat is impossible to feel on screen.

2368
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:15,908
- So that's why in the summer... - Right.

2369
01:34:15,909 --> 01:34:16,909
- It's cold in the winter. - It snows.

2370
01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:18,710
You can feel it in the winter.

2371
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:21,449
For the show, could you pass out, Eun Jin?

2372
01:34:21,649 --> 01:34:22,649
Really?

2373
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:23,948
(An example)

2374
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:25,618
Who passes out...

2375
01:34:25,619 --> 01:34:27,720
- with her hand on the temple? - Hey.

2376
01:34:27,819 --> 01:34:29,389
Why would you bounce your head while passing out?

2377
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:32,090
- Exactly. Who passes out like that? - Why would you bounce?

2378
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:33,960
- Jun Myun, show us. - What?

2379
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:36,460
- Passing out from the heat. - Due to the heat...

2380
01:34:36,829 --> 01:34:38,828
- You feel dizzy. - I'm terrible at this.

2381
01:34:38,829 --> 01:34:39,829
(Scene-stealer Park Jun Myun's acting)

2382
01:34:43,569 --> 01:34:45,640
- Please show us. - Is this an acting lesson?

2383
01:34:46,409 --> 01:34:48,408
I showed them how to pass out...

2384
01:34:48,409 --> 01:34:49,739
from the heat.

2385
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:51,809
(Tidying his hair)

2386
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:53,479
Am I getting hot from the heat?

2387
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:54,480
(Step 1: The body gets heated up.)

2388
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:57,849
(Step 2: Wiping off the falling sweat)

2389
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:59,189
(Sighing)

2390
01:34:59,689 --> 01:35:02,220
(When is he going to faint?)

2391
01:35:02,689 --> 01:35:05,390
(She feels flushed from watching him.)

2392
01:35:05,989 --> 01:35:08,658
(Step 3: Fainting before putting his cap back on)

2393
01:35:08,659 --> 01:35:10,230
Wasn't his preparation too long?

2394
01:35:10,699 --> 01:35:12,430
- He prepared... - The director would say,

2395
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:15,599
- "Please make it shorter." - Right.

01:42:08,811 --> 01:42:11,748
Isn't this much easier than catching anchovies?

2558
01:42:11,749 --> 01:42:14,350
- This is a piece of cake. - Piece of cake?

2559
01:42:14,989 --> 01:42:17,818
You were covered with fish scales, and it looked like a mess.

2560
01:42:17,819 --> 01:42:19,629
That was...

2561
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:21,658
- very surprising for me. - We're setting out now.

2562
01:42:21,659 --> 01:42:23,299
- Okay. - Please be careful.

2563
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:25,300
- Can I sit here? - Sit down.

2564
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:27,599
Yes, sit down.

2565
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,399
- Here we go. - Here we go.

2566
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:32,239
Hey.

2567
01:42:32,539 --> 01:42:35,109
- Goodbye. - See you later.

2568
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:36,739
This is war.

2569
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:39,849
- We're on the same team. - Okay, you're right.

2570
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:40,909
(I forgot about that.)

2571
01:42:41,079 --> 01:42:42,919
He feels sad about it.

2572
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:43,979
(Laughing)

2573
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,118
(Feeling sad)

2574
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:46,219
Originally, it was a competition.

2575
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:48,220
(Jun Myun's boat leaves first.)

2576
01:42:49,819 --> 01:42:52,730
(Jung Ah's boat departs after them.)

2577
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:58,060
(Will their pike eel hunt be successful?)

2578
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:01,399
Let's give it a try.

2579
01:43:03,699 --> 01:43:04,898
Let's hook them on.

2580
01:43:04,899 --> 01:43:06,739
(Under Captain Yum's lead, they start hooking on the bait.)

2581
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:08,339
Do we have to hook them in order?

2582
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,408
- Yes, in order. - We have to do it in order.

2583
01:43:10,409 --> 01:43:13,179
Otherwise, the fishing line will get entangled.

2584
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:14,448
(If the bait isn't hooked on in order, )

2585
01:43:14,449 --> 01:43:15,679
(the fishing line gets entangled.)

2586
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,778
Should we use bait in another basket?

2587
01:43:17,779 --> 01:43:19,619
- Are we using all these baskets? - Yes.

2588
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:21,090
We should do that one.

2589
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,319
I'll use fish in this basket.

2590
01:43:24,189 --> 01:43:25,520
I'll do this one.

2591
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:29,960
(They're gathered and in charge of each basket.)

2592
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:37,498
(Each fish with care)

2593
01:43:37,499 --> 01:43:40,670
(They hook on the bait.)

2594
01:43:41,539 --> 01:43:43,039
How many meters is a pike eel?

2595
01:43:43,539 --> 01:43:45,109
How long is it?

2596
01:43:45,779 --> 01:43:47,779
It's about 60 to 70cm.

2597
01:43:48,149 --> 01:43:49,618
Some are one meter long.

2598
01:43:49,619 --> 01:43:51,480
- Really? - Yes.

2599
01:43:51,619 --> 01:43:54,119
- Pike eel have a big mouth. - Okay.

2600
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,688
They eat the bait whole.

2601
01:43:56,689 --> 01:43:57,719
I see.

2602
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:58,889
(They eat the bait whole.)

2603
01:43:58,890 --> 01:43:59,890
That's amazing.

2604
01:43:59,891 --> 01:44:02,189
I only knew how to eat it.

2605
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,130
I've never seen how it got caught.

2606
01:44:04,859 --> 01:44:05,998
It's fascinating.

2607
01:44:05,999 --> 01:44:07,170
(It gets frightening the more you know about it.)

2608
01:44:07,399 --> 01:44:10,499
Tae Hyun, you're like one of the original members.

2609
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,499
I can totally see that.

2610
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:15,538
- From the start. - Like a member from the start.

2611
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:16,640
(Laboring so naturally)

2612
01:44:17,539 --> 01:44:20,510
Originally, only Jung Ah and I were planning to come.

2613
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:22,879
Tae Hyun came with us...

2614
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,680
because he really wanted to help.

2615
01:44:26,189 --> 01:44:27,219
I feel grateful.

2616
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:29,090
Right? I feel grateful too.

2617
01:44:29,989 --> 01:44:31,960
It's so heartwarming.

2618
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:35,260
That's an amazing technique.

2619
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:40,769
The technique of controlling people.

2620
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:41,770
(Tae Hyun got caught before the pike eel.)

2621
01:44:41,771 --> 01:44:42,840
Goodness.

2622
01:44:43,239 --> 01:44:45,068
I don't feel good about it either.

2623
01:44:45,069 --> 01:44:46,239
(Joking)

2624
01:44:47,539 --> 01:44:49,139
This is how Fresh off the Sea manipulates you.

2625
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:50,380
Gosh. I see.

2626
01:44:50,779 --> 01:44:53,850
I came to the sea, but I never got to see it.

2627
01:44:55,210 --> 01:44:56,778
Look at him work.

2628
01:44:56,779 --> 01:44:58,619
(He's working while looking at the floor.)

2629
01:44:58,819 --> 01:45:01,448
I thought that they used a machine.

2630
01:45:01,449 --> 01:45:02,748
I expected them to lay out the net...

2631
01:45:02,749 --> 01:45:06,260
and scoop up the pike eel very easily.

2632
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:07,788
- They work every detail. - Right.

2633
01:45:07,789 --> 01:45:09,229
- Everything requires work. - Right.

2634
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:10,858
Hook the bait quickly.

2635
01:45:10,859 --> 01:45:12,760
- I'm sorry. We'll do it fast. - Yes, sir.

2636
01:45:14,069 --> 01:45:15,069
We should hook it quickly.

2637
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:17,670
- I don't have time to chat. - Right? To lower the line quickly.

2638
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:20,368
We must be at the fishing spot.

2639
01:45:20,369 --> 01:45:22,310
The boat isn't advancing farther.

2640
01:45:22,409 --> 01:45:24,509
- He's waiting for the boulter. - Really?

2641
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:25,538
(The captain is waiting for the bait to be hooked.)

2642
01:45:25,539 --> 01:45:27,278
- I'll do it. - Goodness.

2643
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,310
I'll do it.

2644
01:45:29,579 --> 01:45:30,680
We need to do one more.

2645
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:33,819
We should hook it fast, or the captain will scold us.

2646
01:45:34,649 --> 01:45:36,260
We're slow, aren't we?

2647
01:45:37,189 --> 01:45:38,989
I'll try to speed up.

2648
01:45:41,489 --> 01:45:44,859
(The bait factory starts to operate.)

2649
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:51,140
(Everyone is concentrating in silence.)

2650
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:55,309
I'm like a machine.

2651
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:56,379
(What?)

2652
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:57,409
Right?

2653
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:59,210
I'm a machine that hooks on bait.

2654
01:46:00,749 --> 01:46:02,609
Look at this.

2655
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:03,819
My gosh.

2656
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:06,720
Isn't the process much faster now that we joined you?

2657
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,119
- It's faster. - Right?

2658
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,220
- Is everything going well? - Yes.

2659
01:46:15,829 --> 01:46:16,859
I'm done.

2660
01:46:17,399 --> 01:46:18,460
Are you done?

2661
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:19,770
My gosh.

2662
01:46:20,329 --> 01:46:21,329
He's fast.

2663
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:22,369
(Work at the bait factory is done.)

2664
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,810
(Meanwhile, Jun Myun's boat is sailing.)

2665
01:46:27,539 --> 01:46:28,539
(Scowling)

2666
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:29,840
What's wrong with the waves?

2667
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:33,349
(Battling with the waves)

2668
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,409
(I surrender.)

2669
01:46:37,449 --> 01:46:41,350
(Flustered by the waves stronger than expected)

2670
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,658
(They move to avoid the waves.)

2671
01:46:46,659 --> 01:46:48,090
(Splashing)

2672
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:50,629
(A shield)

2673
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:51,630
Jun Myun, look.

2674
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:58,499
(Dex's temptation that comes close to "Temptation of Wolves")

2675
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,640
Are you blocking the waves?

2676
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:01,409
(Laughing)

2677
01:47:02,539 --> 01:47:05,640
(They get lost in thoughts after getting used to the waves.)

2678
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:15,220
(It reminds us of a particular scene.)

2679
01:47:17,659 --> 01:47:20,430
(Taking place again at Jaran Bay)

2680
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:24,430
(Sad love of a couple)

2681
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:29,029
(The scene that left a mark in the history of cinema)

2682
01:47:31,739 --> 01:47:33,568
(Do you remember?)

2683
01:47:33,569 --> 01:47:35,310
Ma'am, do you know this scene?

2684
01:47:35,409 --> 01:47:36,480
- I don't know. - Okay.

2685
01:47:37,609 --> 01:47:39,879
(It's from a movie called "Titanic.")

2686
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,010
- I don't know. - Please excuse us.

2687
01:47:44,319 --> 01:47:45,349
Is this the place?

2688
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:46,520
(Buoy)

2689
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:49,520
(Jun Myun's boat also gets ready for work.)

2690
01:47:49,859 --> 01:47:51,419
He's going to lower it now.

2691
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:53,689
(It's time for Jung Ah's boat to lower the bait.)

2692
01:47:54,829 --> 01:47:55,858
Let's go and take a look.

2693
01:47:55,859 --> 01:47:56,859
(Curious)

2694
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,770
(Throwing out the buoy to mark where the bait is lowered)

2695
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:08,609
(Attaching an anchor at the end of the boulter before throwing)

2696
01:48:09,779 --> 01:48:12,840
- The bait goes down one by one. - Yes, automatically.

2697
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:14,809
Automatically?

2698
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:17,649
(The bait gets lowered automatically.)

2699
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:20,889
- Isn't it fascinating? - That's why the bait had to be...

2700
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:22,520
- hooked in order. - Right.

2701
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:25,688
Otherwise, the boulter will get tangled.

2702
01:48:25,689 --> 01:48:27,359
It has to be lowered in order too.

2703
01:48:28,689 --> 01:48:31,630
- Everything is done by hand. - I know.

2704
01:48:31,829 --> 01:48:34,600
Jung Ah, I thought that it was easy.

2705
01:48:34,869 --> 01:48:38,538
I expected them to scoop up the eel, but that wasn't it.

2706
01:48:38,539 --> 01:48:40,608
- Neither harvesting corn... - Right.

2707
01:48:40,609 --> 01:48:41,669
Nor picking peaches was easy.

2708
01:48:41,670 --> 01:48:44,340
- It was the same for kabocha. - Doing this one by one...

2709
01:48:45,539 --> 01:48:47,448
I feel like I'm learning about life.

2710
01:48:47,449 --> 01:48:49,920
(Despite the experience, it's always surprising at the site of labor.)

2711
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,778
- Isn't it over 100 fish? - There's 130.

2712
01:48:52,779 --> 01:48:53,818
There's 130?

2713
01:48:53,819 --> 01:48:54,949
(130 fish as bait per boulter)

2714
01:48:55,819 --> 01:48:59,118
Do you catch the eel with most of the bait?

2715
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:00,289
- No. - About half?

2716
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:03,198
We catch a maximum...

2717
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:05,498
- of 20 to 30 eel in a basket. - From 20 to 30?

2718
01:49:05,499 --> 01:49:07,799
Sometimes, we don't catch any.

2719
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,130
- Really? - We don't catch any sometimes.

2720
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:12,199
That would be a waste. We hooked 130 fish on it.

2721
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:15,609
- You catch less than 20 percent. - Right.

2722
01:49:16,539 --> 01:49:18,539
I hope that we'll catch many eel.

2723
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,550
Bite the bait.

2724
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:23,350
Jung Ah, take a seat.

2725
01:49:23,949 --> 01:49:25,278
- Okay. - Have a seat, Jung Ah.

2726
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:26,349
(They take a break while the bait is thrown.)

2727
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:28,748
- Again... - I wish that we could have...

2728
01:49:28,749 --> 01:49:30,460
done this yesterday.

2729
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,260
If you harvested corn today,

2730
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,359
I'd have left without regret this morning.

2731
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:38,398
He wanted to leave a mark on the show, but he couldn't.

2732
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:39,460
Right.

2733
01:49:39,730 --> 01:49:41,398
That's exactly right.

2734
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:43,739
He realized that it wasn't enough after working.

2735
01:49:44,170 --> 01:49:45,970
Yesterday, I watched the episode when Jung Min was here.

2736
01:49:46,270 --> 01:49:48,239
He worked so hard.

2737
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:51,709
He worked hard even when he was acting.

2738
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:54,449
(He acted well when it came to acting.)

2739
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:56,919
Along this path

2740
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,479
He labored the longest.

2741
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,119
He really did.

2742
01:50:01,689 --> 01:50:04,390
(Jung Min left a strong mark on the show.)

2743
01:50:05,619 --> 01:50:07,029
Tae Hyun felt a lot of pressure.

2744
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:09,390
- He worked really hard. - I shouldn't have watched it.

2745
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,828
- He was really professional. - I felt uncomfortable.

2746
01:50:12,829 --> 01:50:15,600
You're definitely professional. Professional Cha.

2747
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:18,038
(Meanwhile)

2748
01:50:18,039 --> 01:50:19,039
Wait.

2749
01:50:19,939 --> 01:50:21,670
He finished throwing the fishing line.

2750
01:50:22,069 --> 01:50:23,069
What?

2751
01:50:23,070 --> 01:50:25,510
Shall we catch some eel?

2752
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:28,350
I'm curious...

2753
01:50:28,649 --> 01:50:31,050
- about what's coming? - What will come up?

2754
01:50:31,149 --> 01:50:32,880
Let it be 100 pike eel.

2755
01:50:35,989 --> 01:50:37,420
Let's do this.

2756
01:50:39,619 --> 01:50:41,288
(Ms. Park Sook Yeon gets ready for work.)

2757
01:50:41,289 --> 01:50:42,560
That one has a wheel underneath.

2758
01:50:44,359 --> 01:50:45,829
It must involve some kind of technique.

2759
01:50:49,329 --> 01:50:51,670
The pike eel must come this way.

2760
01:50:52,170 --> 01:50:53,669
(A machine that pulls up the boulter)

2761
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:54,869
It pulls up the fish.

2762
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,909
What should we do then?

2763
01:50:58,510 --> 01:51:01,408
This is where we create the scene.

2764
01:51:01,409 --> 01:51:04,050
- We're wrapped with pike eel. - Our lips get bitten?

2765
01:51:04,279 --> 01:51:06,279
- And scream. - Our necks get wrapped around.

2766
01:51:06,749 --> 01:51:08,188
The pike eel rises up here.

2767
01:51:08,189 --> 01:51:09,649
(A significant scene in variety shows)

2768
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:12,920
(This should be good enough to leave a mark.)

2769
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:15,130
Catching how many eel is your goal today?

2770
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:18,229
About 200.

2771
01:51:18,230 --> 01:51:20,328
- Did you say ten? - About 250.

2772
01:51:20,329 --> 01:51:21,698
- About 250? - About 250?

2773
01:51:21,699 --> 01:51:24,038
- Catching 100 is nothing. - Not at all.

2774
01:51:24,039 --> 01:51:25,568
Catching 250 eel? Okay.

2775
01:51:25,569 --> 01:51:28,438
- Everyone, scream "250." - Two hundred and fifty!

2776
01:51:28,439 --> 01:51:30,840
(Scream, everyone.)

2777
01:51:31,079 --> 01:51:33,079
- My goodness. - What's going on?

2778
01:51:33,779 --> 01:51:36,350
(The roaring sound makes them tense up.)

2779
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:37,550
It must be coming up.

2780
01:51:38,779 --> 01:51:40,749
- Sit down. - Should we sit down?

2781
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:42,050
You can sit down.

2782
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:45,390
Why do I feel nervous?

2783
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:49,328
- Pike eel means... - Pike eel.

2784
01:51:49,329 --> 01:51:50,759
"bite" in Japanese.

2785
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,359
- Bite? - Bite?

2786
01:51:53,329 --> 01:51:55,028
Is it really painful when the pike eel bites?

2787
01:51:55,029 --> 01:51:57,439
- It twists and tears off your skin. - Gosh.

2788
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,670
It's like a snake.

2789
01:51:58,939 --> 01:52:00,109
It's hot-tempered.

2790
01:52:00,210 --> 01:52:03,439
It must be vicious and violent.

2791
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,148
One of the floats came up.

2792
01:52:07,149 --> 01:52:08,209
(The fishing line is getting pulled up.)

2793
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:09,550
It came up without the bait.

2794
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,220
(Their eyes are fixed on it.)

2795
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:14,220
- Gosh. - It's here.

2796
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,520
It's here.

2797
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:22,029
It's here.

2798
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:25,858
It's here.

2799
01:52:25,859 --> 01:52:26,930
(Pike eel appears.)

2800
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:28,799
This is incredible.

2801
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:29,998
(Caught pike eel goes straight to the fish hold.)

2802
01:52:29,999 --> 01:52:31,039
It went inside.

2803
01:52:31,499 --> 01:52:33,509
One of you, please sit close to here.

2804
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:35,069
Bring your chair here.

2805
01:52:36,069 --> 01:52:37,839
- Are you going to try? - That's right.

2806
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:38,840
(Captain Yum goes up bravely.)

2807
01:52:39,539 --> 01:52:40,949
Do I throw it in here?

2808
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:43,819
How can you catch that?

2809
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,520
It looks strong.

2810
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:48,850
- Grab it here. - Cut it off.

2811
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:51,219
Look at the teeth.

2812
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:54,260
(The pike eel squirms threateningly.)

2813
01:52:54,829 --> 01:52:56,859
- With the knife. - Cut it with the knife.

2814
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:59,730
- Cut it off? I got it now. - Cut it off.

2815
01:53:00,199 --> 01:53:02,869
That's why there was a knife.

2816
01:53:03,739 --> 01:53:05,670
(Captain Yum realized how it's done.)

2817
01:53:06,069 --> 01:53:09,109
- Here it comes. - It's coming.

2818
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,509
Okay.

2819
01:53:10,510 --> 01:53:12,380
(One shot, one kill)

2820
01:53:12,909 --> 01:53:14,049
- We caught it. - It's here.

2821
01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:16,249
- It's coming. - It's here.

2822
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:19,180
- Good. - It's big.

2823
01:53:19,779 --> 01:53:21,519
We're catching a lot.

2824
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,859
(She takes care of it every time it comes up.)

2825
01:53:24,619 --> 01:53:26,960
All I can do is cheer her on.

2826
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:28,959
- Are you okay? - Yes.

2827
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,800
(She gets closer to the pike eel.)

2828
01:53:33,499 --> 01:53:34,529
Hey.

2829
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:35,929
- Gosh. - Instead of assisting...

2830
01:53:35,930 --> 01:53:37,269
(In front of a pike eel that's squirming for its life...)

2831
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:38,840
Hey, Eun Jin.

2832
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:41,609
What are you doing as an assistant?

2833
01:53:42,569 --> 01:53:45,038
How can you get scared over there?

2834
01:53:45,039 --> 01:53:46,640
(In reality, Tae Hyun isn't doing anything either.)

2835
01:53:47,310 --> 01:53:49,579
I don't feel brave enough.

2836
01:53:51,579 --> 01:53:53,390
I can't touch fish.

2837
01:53:55,189 --> 01:53:58,060
I'd like to do my best, but...

2838
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:01,028
When it comes to fish...

2839
01:54:01,029 --> 01:54:02,288
This one is huge.

2840
01:54:02,289 --> 01:54:04,529
Anchovies were small and dead.

2841
01:54:04,999 --> 01:54:07,129
(Anchovies were definitely small and cute.)

2842
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:08,199
But this...

2843
01:54:08,569 --> 01:54:10,999
- It's flapping? - It's flapping,

2844
01:54:11,239 --> 01:54:13,239
so it's scary.

2845
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:16,909
- This one is big. - It's huge.

2846
01:54:17,539 --> 01:54:18,578
Okay.

2847
01:54:18,579 --> 01:54:19,579
(On the other hand, Jung Ah likes the work.)

2848
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:21,210
(Exclaiming)

2849
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,318
- Look at this, Eun Jin. - Gosh.

2850
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:25,420
That's crazy.

2851
01:54:26,119 --> 01:54:28,189
- You should film this. - Come and look.

2852
01:54:28,949 --> 01:54:31,159
- I'm so scared. - It won't let go of the knife.

2853
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:33,089
It's like a horror movie.

2854
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:35,789
(Is this a special horror movie?)

2855
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:37,459
What should I do with it?

2856
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:39,130
(Shocked)

2857
01:54:39,630 --> 01:54:40,698
- Gosh. - You...

2858
01:54:40,699 --> 01:54:41,730
(The frightening strength of the pike eel's jaw)

2859
01:54:41,829 --> 01:54:42,930
It's gone now.

2860
01:54:43,170 --> 01:54:44,839
(If it bites you...)

2861
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,670
- That was incredible. - It was so frightening.

2862
01:54:48,369 --> 01:54:50,710
- We must focus when grabbing it. - Right.

2863
01:54:54,109 --> 01:54:55,279
Be careful.

2864
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:59,520
(Jung Ah came close to getting bitten.)

2865
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:02,989
- When I got close... It didn't. - Did it bite you?

2866
01:55:03,859 --> 01:55:05,559
- Are you okay, Jung Ah? - Yes.

2867
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:06,788
(Fearless and skillful Jung Ah)

2868
01:55:06,789 --> 01:55:09,059
You're the expert. I can't do it.

2869
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:10,060
(She looks like a pike eel master of 30 years.)

2870
01:55:10,061 --> 01:55:11,130
It looks dangerous.

2871
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:14,130
Gosh, it's big.

2872
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:16,469
- It's big. - It's really big.

2873
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:17,498
What's this?

2874
01:55:17,499 --> 01:55:18,499
(It's time for the pike eel master's show.)

2875
01:55:20,069 --> 01:55:21,139
We got it.

2876
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:22,640
(She handles large pike eel without a problem.)

2877
01:55:25,779 --> 01:55:27,479
(The next pike eel...)

2878
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:29,210
(gets scored in.)

2879
01:55:29,810 --> 01:55:31,779
Well, she was born to do this.

2880
01:55:34,189 --> 01:55:36,090
She's got amazing skills.

2881
01:55:36,789 --> 01:55:38,819
- She's a professional now. - She's great at this.

2882
01:55:38,989 --> 01:55:40,590
It's big!

2883
01:55:45,829 --> 01:55:46,999
You don't have to be an actress.

2884
01:55:47,329 --> 01:55:48,669
I don't have to be an actress.

2885
01:55:48,670 --> 01:55:51,039
- Come here and fish with us. - Right.

2886
01:55:51,739 --> 01:55:55,170
- She's amazing. - She's so good at it.

2887
01:55:55,909 --> 01:55:56,909
There's nothing I need to do.

2888
01:55:57,279 --> 01:55:59,539
(How do I do this?)

2889
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:03,850
(Just go for it.)

2890
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:06,079
I've prepared for this day.

2891
01:56:06,890 --> 01:56:09,920
(Jung Ah crashes into the tasks she has never done before.)

2892
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:13,390
(With her indomitable will for a challenge, )

2893
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:17,659
(she shows off her amazing talent in all tasks.)

2894
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:25,698
(Even with the pike eel fishing, )

2895
01:56:25,699 --> 01:56:26,699
(she crashed into it right away.)

2896
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,938
They keep on coming.

2897
01:56:27,939 --> 01:56:31,439
- Great! - Great!

2898
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:35,980
Jung Ah is working like someone who has been here for years.

2899
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:37,618
(Pike eel expert, Eel Yum?)

2900
01:56:37,619 --> 01:56:38,819
You're so good at this.

2901
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:41,849
- How many of them came up? - Sorry?

2902
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:43,720
How many of them came up? Around 20?

2903
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:47,960
- It's more than 20. - Is that so?

2904
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:51,229
(Thanks to Eel Yum's amazing work, )

2905
01:56:51,230 --> 01:56:52,759
We must be done with one basket.

2906
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:54,329
(they were able to clear one basket of the bait in a flash.)

2907
01:56:54,970 --> 01:56:58,470
Out of all the tasks we did,

2908
01:56:59,369 --> 01:57:00,409
this one was the most exciting one.

2909
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,538
She thinks it's exciting. What a relief.

2910
01:57:03,539 --> 01:57:04,738
(Jung Ah has fallen into pike eel fishing.)

2911
01:57:04,739 --> 01:57:06,180
- What a relief. - It's so much fun.

2912
01:57:07,392 --> 01:57:08,991
(With the appearance of Eel Yum...)

2913
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,862
(who knows how to control the pike eels, )

2914
01:57:11,163 --> 01:57:13,933
(it feels like a festival on the boat.)

2915
01:57:14,402 --> 01:57:15,763
(Let's get all of the pike eels.)

2916
01:57:15,902 --> 01:57:17,602
(It's raining a lot over there.)

2917
01:57:17,973 --> 01:57:19,902
(Instead of the eels that were told to come, )

2918
01:57:20,942 --> 01:57:22,641
(rain...)

2919
01:57:22,642 --> 01:57:26,013
(is coming.)

2920
01:57:26,213 --> 01:57:29,343
(A lot of rain)

2921
01:57:30,352 --> 01:57:31,951
(To top it off, )

2922
01:57:31,952 --> 01:57:33,352
(there's screaming?)

2923
01:57:33,583 --> 01:57:35,883
(Gosh, this is a mess.)

2924
01:57:36,822 --> 01:57:39,923
(What has happened on the pike eel boat in the rain?)

2925
01:57:40,392 --> 01:57:41,821
(What else can we do?)

2926
01:57:41,822 --> 01:57:43,123
(Let's see the end of the pike eels.)

2927
01:57:43,562 --> 01:57:45,593
(Handling the eels they caught with care)

2928
01:57:46,133 --> 01:57:48,532
(The younger ones are in full battle mode too.)

2929
01:57:49,062 --> 01:57:52,332
(The broth is ready too, right?)

2930
01:57:52,333 --> 01:57:53,942
(It's too bland.)

2931
01:57:54,673 --> 01:57:56,873
(She pressures Jung Ah.)

2932
01:57:56,973 --> 01:57:59,641
(This person is serious...)

2933
01:57:59,642 --> 01:58:01,312
(about today's dinner.)

2934
01:58:02,183 --> 01:58:03,752
(Jung Ah catches the details more...)

2935
01:58:03,753 --> 01:58:05,382
(than strict Sauce Park?)

2936
01:58:05,383 --> 01:58:07,351
(Oh, you're right.)

2937
01:58:07,352 --> 01:58:08,352
(Sugar!)

2938
01:58:08,583 --> 01:58:10,182
(She tries it again.)

2939
01:58:10,183 --> 01:58:11,553
(It takes longer to try it.)

2940
01:58:11,793 --> 01:58:13,423
(The sauce is a bit bland, isn't it?)

2941
01:58:13,692 --> 01:58:15,763
(Where is the sauce?)

2942
01:58:16,123 --> 01:58:17,191
(She is already working on it.)

2943
01:58:17,192 --> 01:58:18,192
(Sauce Park is way ahead of her.)

2944
01:58:18,593 --> 01:58:21,503
(What is for today's dinner that they are working hard on?)

2945
01:58:22,032 --> 01:58:23,601
(A meal made with...)

2946
01:58:23,602 --> 01:58:25,503
(the pike eels the siblings caught)

2947
01:58:26,173 --> 01:58:27,173
(Shabu-shabu and grilled pike eel)

2948
01:58:27,174 --> 01:58:28,303
(A pike eel meal fresh off the sea)

2949
01:58:28,742 --> 01:58:29,902
(However, )

2950
01:58:30,473 --> 01:58:32,973
(the war of nerves over the eel isn't over yet.)

2951
01:58:33,473 --> 01:58:35,683
(She leaves in the end.)

2952
01:58:36,942 --> 01:58:38,252
(Are the siblings breaking up?)

2953
01:58:38,253 --> 01:58:39,253
(Gosh, I feel nervous.)

2954
01:58:39,253 --> 01:58:40,253
(Do it now.)

2955
01:58:40,282 --> 01:58:41,923
(A while later)

2956
01:58:42,923 --> 01:58:44,753
Hey, Jung Ah. Today...

2957
01:58:44,892 --> 01:58:46,723
(Pausing)

2958
01:58:47,123 --> 01:58:49,123
(What is all this?)

2959
01:58:49,322 --> 01:58:54,003
(A mysterious show begins during the night in Goseong!)
