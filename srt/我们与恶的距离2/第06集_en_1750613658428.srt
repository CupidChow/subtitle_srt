00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,340
During lightning pool Director Lin Guoyu's interview for the parliament, he said,

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,060
Because of the hassle of a primeiro, grond 어� were started Twenty Suzanne

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,400
Our public merci nunca a lubiver

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,200
Today, the public group held a press conference at Qingyun Station

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
and said that it was too unbearable.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,200
We call on the public opinion representatives

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,400
to stop the down-and-out behavior immediately.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,400
We also ask the artist Lin Guoyong to come out immediately

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
and apologize to the public.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,400
I will call on the people of the city to stop the corruption.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Now the government has released a list of famous people

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
to create chaos.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,400
It's the public's fault that people can't see it

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
and make people go to the police.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,000
Now the Qingyun County government

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,200
can't find anyone to come out and take over the self-regulation.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,000
This is the most important thing.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,600
The grass case of the street friends' self-regulation

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,600
has been sent to the office of each member.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,200
So I hope we can

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
focus on the problem this time.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Let's solve it together.

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,000
Don't fall into the so-called party confrontation.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,400
So we are very sorry

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
for the damage caused by the street friends.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,600
The subsequent county government will also ask the public

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,400
to continue to follow and care

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
about the damage caused by the street friends.

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Come on, have a taste.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Thank you.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,400
By the way, how are Li Yun and the children?

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Are they okay?

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
That's it.

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Li Yun is now in a stable position.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,200
I want to thank you for your advice at that time.

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,800
It's our own business.

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
I have to thank you.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Why do you talk about this to your old friend?

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
You just give me a good school.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,000
How are you doing recently?

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Very good.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm doing well.

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
When he was the county governor,

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,600
he took good care of our community.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,400
My father Liu Xinchun is the governor.

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Of course I know.

48
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,800
I hope your future is good.

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
It's good to know.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You have to go to the press to run my house.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,200
You are joking.

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
I believe you.

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Today, it's okay to lie to me.

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,200
Because when we open the door,

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,400
I know who is in charge.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
If there are any problems, tell me.

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I'll deal with it.

58
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
Next time, you will be in my good hands.

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,300
The current situation in the district

60
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,000
is now under the new district committee.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,200
This is what I wanted to do after being elected to the Legislative Committee.

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,400
It includes the regulation of the district's social and economic management.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
If you have any questions,

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
just tell me.

65
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
You are so careful.

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm a service to the people.

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Come on, let's drink.

68
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
You have to go to work.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,800
Don't waste your time here.

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
There's nothing to say anyway.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
When are you going to the press?

72
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
Do you want to go abroad with me

73
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
so that you can find your little son?

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm just thinking.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
You go abroad to find Guan Peng.

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Who will take care of Guan Jun when he comes home?

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,400
This family is because I didn't take good care of it.

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
That's why your mother fell.

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
Guan Jun stole from someone.

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
It's also my fault that I didn't teach him well.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,400
He set fire to my job as a mother.

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Aren't you afraid that I would teach a murderer?

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,800
The good things about Guan Peng are all your family's genes.

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,000
But Guan Jun ruined the good blood of your family.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,800
Do you want to take him to check his DNA?

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
Maybe he's the one who stole from someone outside.

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,000
What's the use of being so self-willed?

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why can't you talk nicely?

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,600
Whatever I say and do,

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
you and your mother are so annoying.

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,800
How can I talk nicely?

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,400
That was a long time ago.

93
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Why do you keep those bad words in your head?

94
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Aren't you tired?

95
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Hu Jia Wei.

96
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
Then say something nice.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,600
Let me forget those bad words.

98
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
Hurry up!

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Hurry up!

100
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,240
Guan Jun can be discharged.

101
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Before that, I want to talk it on your behalf

102
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
whether you can take Guan Jun home or not.

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,400
Because directing a child to the control unit during an appeal

104
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,040
won't be a blessing for the baby.

105
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
He needs to learn a lesson.

106
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
He is only 18 years old.

107
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,040
The end of the case is to hand over the case.

108
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Not to be punished.

109
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Hand over?

110
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Then you hand it over.

111
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
My job is

112
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
to play the role of

113
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:22,740
a good

114
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
Go to the prison.

115
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,740
The staff of the youth service center and the school are not enough.

116
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,740
The classroom and the living environment are very bad.

117
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
There are not enough teachers

118
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
to help children like Guanjun.

119
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
The country can't accept it.

120
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
Have you ever raised a child who is not obedient?

121
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
I don't have my own child.

122
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,740
But I was a child

123
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,740
who didn't listen to the school.

124
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,740
I went through the school.

125
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,740
My father is a pastor.

126
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
In his eyes,

127
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,740
I seem to be a

128
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,740
God should pay for the charity.

129
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,740
I still can't achieve

130
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,740
the goal he set.

131
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,740
But my mother is by my side.

132
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,740
Always with me.

133
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,740
Wait for me to grow up.

134
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Wait for you to grow up.

135
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
How big is he to change?

136
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,740
I know in the past,

137
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,740
you must have given a lot of effort

138
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,740
to Guanjun.

139
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,740
But I hope you can think about

140
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,740
there is no place

141
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,740
that can lock Guanjun forever.

142
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
You see, your wife

143
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
will face this child one day.

144
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Yes.

145
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Piao.

146
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,740
Piao.

147
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,740
Piao, I'm a mother.

148
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Do you hear me?

149
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
I'm a mother.

150
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,740
Do you see?

151
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,740
Do you see me?

152
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Mom.

153
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,740
I'm like this.

154
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,740
You still call me by my name every day.

155
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,740
Do you know?

156
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,740
You're right.

157
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
You're right.

158
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,740
You're not right.

159
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
You're not right.

160
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
How dare you look at me like that?

161
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
I...

162
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
I want to go back.

163
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
I want to go back.

164
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
Look at me.

165
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,740
You're growing up here.

166
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,740
You're going to hear the voice of the doctor.

167
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Come on.

168
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
Let's go back.

169
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Come on.

170
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
I'm crying.

171
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
I'm crying.

172
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,740
Dad.

173
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,740
Dad is crying.

174
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,740
Come back and see your dad.

175
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,740
Come back.

176
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Your dad.

177
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Your dad is crying.

178
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Come back.

179
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Come back.

180
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,740
Xiaogui.

181
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,740
Xiaogui.

182
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Come back.

183
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
Xiaogui.

184
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,740
I'm here to ask the previous owner of the house

185
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
to let me go back to work.

186
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,740
We can also buy vegetables.

187
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,740
You're not feeling well.

188
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,740
My grandma can take care of her kids for a few years.

189
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
I must be able to help her.

190
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
My grandma doesn't have a grandson.

191
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
You're the one who brought me to the house.

192
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,740
You're not the one who's in charge here.

193
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
Don't worry.

194
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,740
We can do it.

195
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,740
We can do it.

196
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Dad.

197
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,740
This is the ADHD test.

198
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
Please refer to it.

199
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Let's sit here and explain it to you.

200
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Please sit.

201
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,740
So, ADHD is a multi-pronged brain tumor.

202
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,740
It's the same as the normal blood pressure.

203
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,740
Compared to the normal blood pressure, it's a bit lower.

204
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,740
So, its brain can't effectively process all the information.

205
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,740
So, it will have some problems in the main organ.

206
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,740
It will have a lot of impulses and over-emphasis.

207
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
The point is,

208
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
according to Guan Jingjing's ability as a child,

209
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
she can't overcome it.

210
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
You mean,

211
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
no matter how hard she tries, her blood will not progress?

212
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
Medicine is helpful to her.

213
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Society is changing.

214
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
Your so-called progress in your studies

215
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,740
may not be the only option now.

216
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,740
A doctor told me that studies are not important.

217
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,740
Don't you know how realistic society is?

218
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
If you can't improve your studies, you'll be the same.

219
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,740
You'll be a low-class person everywhere you go.

220
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Even if society is realistic, it has a warm side, right?

221
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,740
It's a wrong relationship.

222
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,740
Why don't you try to change it? It's weird.

223
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,740
Let me ask you.

224
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,740
I'm just trying to find out if you can cure your disease.

225
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
What's your cure?

226
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,740
The hospital is not a miracle.

227
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Our doctors are not gods, right?

228
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Have you ever thought about the situation your child will be in?

229
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,740
Is it because of the setbacks he has faced since he was a child

230
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,740
that has affected his self-esteem?

231
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,740
So, he'd rather choose to use attack or escape to survive.

232
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
In other words,

233
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
to be seen by you.

234
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
He's not being wronged.

235
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
He's not working hard enough.

236
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Have you ever worked hard for him?

237
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,740
I work hard to make money.

238
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,740
Isn't it for the sake of my child?

239
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,740
You're here to blame others for not getting married or having children.

240
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,740
Yes, even if I get married, I have a family and children.

241
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,740
To be honest, I don't think a capable parent

242
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,740
should throw his child in the hospital or prison.

243
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
He's the same as everyone else.

244
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
He needs a family and a school

245
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
that can be connected to the whole society.

246
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
Find a way that suits him.

247
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
You're right.

248
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Director.

249
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Hello, I'm Chen You Min.

250
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,740
Miss Gui Tai.

251
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
What are you doing here?

252
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,740
I saw the director here.

253
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,740
I wanted to ask you for help.

254
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,740
So, I waited here.

255
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,740
May I ask if you're available now?

256
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Sorry, I'm busy.

257
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,740
Director, my husband has a mental breakdown.

258
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,740
I asked for his help many times before.

259
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
I asked for his leave many times.

260
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,740
I went back to the restaurant later.

261
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
They told me not to go back.

262
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
I really need this job.

263
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,740
I asked the director to help me.

264
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
I won't ask for leave anymore.

265
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,740
I have two very young children.

266
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,740
I really don't know where to find a job.

267
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,740
Director, can you help me?

268
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
I really need this income.

269
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,740
Director, I'm sorry.

270
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
Please don't do this.

271
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
I'm sorry to bother you.

272
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Is your salary enough to raise two children?

273
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
Yes.

274
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
It's enough to save money.

275
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
My mother-in-law is a good person.

276
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,740
She will help me.

277
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Who will take care of your husband?

278
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,740
My mother-in-law will help me.

279
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
I'll lend you some money.

280
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,740
Let your husband live in the nursing home.

281
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
So you can take care of your two children.

282
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,740
I'll go and find out about the restaurant.

283
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,740
Thank you, Director.

284
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,740
But I don't want my husband to be alone in the nursing home.

285
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,740
The doctor said that if you want him to recover normally,

286
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,740
the best way is for the family to be with him.

287
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
Let him have a goal to fight for.

288
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,740
I don't want him to be alone.

289
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,740
Why did you come back?

290
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,740
I came to visit the doctor and let you know that you're not well.

291
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
I'm here to see you.

292
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Why did you come back?

293
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,740
I came to see you.

294
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
I'm here to see you.

295
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
After you get better,

296
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
I'll send you off.

297
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,740
I'm here to see you.

298
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Do you know that I'm here?

299
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
I'm here to see you.

300
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
I'm here to see you.

301
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
I'm here to see you.

302
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,780
Don't annoy me!

303
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,720
Someone is screaming.

304
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,880
You don't annoy me!

305
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,460
Don't interfere with my work!

306
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,320
That's my work.

307
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,400
Don't...

308
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,060
No.

309
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
You hear me?

310
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,420
Don't interfere with my work.

311
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,340
Because you put me in here.

312
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,100
I dare you!

313
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,060
Don't interfere with me!

314
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,060
Don't interfere with my work.

315
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,800
Don't bother me!

316
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,080
Don't mess with me!

317
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Don't touch me!

318
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Don't touch me!

319
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
What am I doing?

320
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Yixing said I've improved a lot.

321
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
I'm going to sleep on the top of this.

322
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,080
But your love...

323
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Love is over.

324
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
These are all your favorite foods.

325
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Don't eat instant noodles at night.

326
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Go to sleep earlier.

327
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Look.

328
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
This is Xiao Yuwei.

329
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
This is Xiao Hui's handprint.

330
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
This is our knife.

331
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
This is mine?

332
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Yes.

333
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Why is it only four gold?

334
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
I'm sorry.

335
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
When you're ready,

336
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
let's go out and play.

337
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Go.

338
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
You've been doing well here.

340
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
How did the psychologist

341
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,080
tell you how to control your emotions?

342
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
How?

343
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Especially when you're hungry,

344
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
you cut your feet and kick it out.

345
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
How much?

346
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Deep breath,

347
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
thank the flowers, thank the grass, thank the weather.

348
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Don't you think it's low energy?

349
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
I think it's a little slow for you to be a child.

350
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Then you can think of something more high energy.

351
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
What comics do you watch?

352
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
The Marriage of the Married.

353
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Then I'm like this.

354
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
When my emotions come,

355
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
I can't control myself anymore.

356
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
When it comes to the neck,

357
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
I have to

358
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
slap it.

359
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,080
Hurry up and seal the nine-tailed fox in my body.

360
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Let it not come out and hurt people.

361
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Idiot, you got it wrong.

362
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
How do you get it?

363
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Like this.

364
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Next time you use this way.

365
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,080
You have to learn how to control your emotions.

366
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Your dad has promised to take you home.

367
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Are you happy?

368
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Are you happy?

369
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Come on.

370
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
The current situation is that the parents are willing to let the child go home.

371
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
It is also reconciled with the school and comic book store.

372
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
The biggest problem is that the current state-owned department

373
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
is not willing to let the child go to school.

374
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
It's all bad.

375
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm thinking if there's a chance to fight for the road.

376
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
This child,

377
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
is studying in the fifth grade in primary school.

378
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
He's studying in the second grade in middle school.

379
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
He's 16 years old and still studying in middle school.

380
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
There must be a lot of situations.

381
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Any school will be worried.

382
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
And the teacher is not enough.

383
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Can the school's charity center

384
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
send more teachers to support?

385
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
No problem.

386
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Is there any other difficulty in the education department?

387
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
I don't want to miss any student.

388
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,080
If you have a problem, say it.

389
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
All the units are here.

390
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
We can solve it together.

391
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
No.

392
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Okay.

393
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
The next discussion is...

394
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Guan Jun.

395
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Do you have any ideas for the future?

396
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
I want to get a good college degree.

397
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,080
I want to study animation in the future.

398
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Okay.

399
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
The judge, the security officer, and your father

400
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
really want to help you.

401
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
We really believe you want to change.

402
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
So we'll give you another chance.

403
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Remember to cooperate with the doctor

404
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
to regularly see the test.

405
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
The judge only requires you to protect the control.

406
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
Report to the security officer every month.

407
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
If you violate the rules, you will be advised to withdraw.

408
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
If you don't change your advice,

409
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
you may be expelled and sent to the education department.

410
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Do you understand now?

411
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
I understand.

412
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
I understand.

413
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
When can I go to London?

414
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
You should get a good college degree.

415
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
You're all a few years old.

416
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
You can go wherever you want during summer vacation.

417
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
You said it.

418
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
You can't be late.

419
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
I mean to say that

420
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
you should not be angry,

421
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
not be rude,

422
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
not be rude,

423
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
and not be rude.

424
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,080
You should eat well.

425
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
You know I'm being rude.

426
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
It's reasonable.

427
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Come on.

428
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
My mom called me this morning

429
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
and said you like sweet and sour fish.

430
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
I cooked it for you.

431
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Here, it's hot.

432
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Thank you, Auntie Zhang.

433
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
No problem. Eat.

434
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Eat.

435
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
What?

436
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
It's my room.

437
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
You're still playing games?

438
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
I'll sleep with you from today.

439
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
What?

440
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
What do you want?

441
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
I'll send you to class tomorrow.

442
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
When you're done, Mr. Kai Le will pick you up

443
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
and take you home for dinner.

444
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
You'll have to do the homework until 10 p.m.

445
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Ask him anything.

446
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
It's like a surveillance camera.

447
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
What surveillance camera?

448
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Don't turn it off.

449
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
This is to make up for your missed class.

450
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
Hong Kong is a good school. You don't have to work hard.

451
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
You can finish the homework first.

452
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
We'll find an art teacher,

453
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
a language teacher,

454
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
and see which language you want to improve.

455
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
I'm sick.

456
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
This is too much.

457
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
You're already taking your medicine.

458
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Let's work together.

459
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:45,760
Don't let this

460
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
go to waste.

461
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Let's work together.

462
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Hu Guan Jun.

463
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,720
You're late for class.

464
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
Wu Guan Jun.

465
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,480
Did you not sleep last night and watch a comic there?

466
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,680
What are you talking about?

467
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,800
Wu Guan Jun.

468
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,480
Wu Guan Jun, hurry up. I have an important meeting this morning.

469
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,040
I'm going to class.

470
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,920
Do you have a panic attack?

471
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,520
Why can't you sleep at night?

472
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,320
I can't sleep well either.

473
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,560
You're so loud. You're making me so noisy.

474
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,560
You have time to talk. Hurry up.

475
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,680
Stop!

476
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,640
Have you been yesterday?

477
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,440
No, nothing.

478
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,880
Really?

479
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,600
A jalapeno is in the building.

480
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,000
Jack is going to gain weight in almost a month.

481
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,680
I can't wait to fight podiatrist.

482
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,640
If you don't班 departure,

483
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,080
I will be keep fighting before you meet me.

484
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,040
Teacher, be careful?

485
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,700
Thank you, sir.

486
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,980
it is refers to your family, health, and sen supporting YiuMing

487
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,460
Ten Alley connection

488
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:45,360
Hein

489
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,040
named in the Scarangle

490
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
The first lady is here.

491
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Come on.

492
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Just sit.

493
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Come on.

494
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
You're not coming.

495
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
You're not coming.

496
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Come on.

497
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Come on.

498
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Come on.

499
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Come on.

500
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Come on.

501
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Sit down.

502
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Sit down.

503
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Come on.

504
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Are you okay?

505
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Come on.

506
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Come on.

507
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Sit here.

508
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
My leg.

509
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
The public!

510
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
The public!

511
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
I'm fine.

512
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Come on.

513
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Come on.

514
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Please sit down.

515
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
I strongly suspect that

516
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
the family of the police is involved in the kidnapping.

517
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Why did he tell them?

518
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
And I'm telling you, I'm also suspecting that

519
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
the teacher...

520
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I'm also suspecting that the teacher and the police are not connected.

521
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
There's no connection between the police and the police.

522
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
I don't think it's necessary.

523
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
After he was promoted, he was anxious about

524
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
the related matters every month.

525
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
He was checking the students who didn't go to school.

526
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
I've never seen any scene

527
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
that was like this.

528
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Okay, then even if the police are not connected,

529
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
please tell me what kind of bad etiquette is there?

530
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
What is called...

531
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
There are always some problems with the environment.

532
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Like the wind is blowing and the water is not getting into the farm.

533
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
What is called...

534
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
If you want to eat chicken, you have to have a farm.

535
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
You are so annoying.

536
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
You are the one who's annoying.

537
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Gao Zheng Guang.

538
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
You really want to be that strict?

539
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Go and sue him.

540
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
I wanted to eat well,

541
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
but I didn't have time to change my mind.

542
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Why did no one change their mind?

543
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Why did I get into a fight with him?

544
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
It's true.

545
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Let me tell you what will happen.

546
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
If I were a dinosaur,

547
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
you would be a dinosaur too.

548
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Don't force me to be a dinosaur here.

549
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Yes. I'm sorry, Your Honor.

550
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
I'll admit that I like you later.

551
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
What are you going to eat tonight?

552
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
What are you looking at?

553
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I'm going to the office.

554
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
I'm going to send the reporter.

555
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Why did the doctor inform you?

556
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
You know, when you touch someone,

557
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
you have to pat them for a long time.

558
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
You are so mean.

559
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
When the reporter came,

560
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
she was so happy to talk to me.

561
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
Please help her to find out the truth.

562
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
You said she's a person.

563
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Why did you force me to come here?

564
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Who's responsible for this?

565
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Me? You are her son.

566
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Okay.

567
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I can't say anything.

568
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Why are you here?

569
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Something happened to her mother.

570
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Is Yuan Xin your mother?

571
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
She's my classmate.

572
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Don't worry.

573
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
She will see her mother with a hundred times more

574
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,040
than you.

575
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,040
What about you?

576
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Why are you here?

577
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
I'm going to the car.

578
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
I'm going to buy her dinner.

579
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Yichiang, I'm hungry.

580
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
What are you doing?

581
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I'm going to buy her dinner.

582
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
You can do it yourself.

583
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Every piece is a piece of cake.

584
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
You don't eat lunch?

585
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
You can eat this.

586
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
I have 15 minutes.

587
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
I'll send you to the airport later.

588
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
You are not that busy.

589
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
How many girls do you have?

590
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
There are 90 girls in the security.

591
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
There are 15 girls in the investigation.

592
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
That's ridiculous.

593
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Do you have your own life?

594
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Do you have one?

595
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I was so angry with you.

596
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
I was so angry.

597
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
What happened?

598
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
She ran away from home.

599
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Her ex-boyfriend was pregnant.

600
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
She ran away.

601
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
I was so angry that

602
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
I couldn't save anyone.

603
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
I was getting more and more angry.

604
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
I didn't even have time to wash my clothes.

605
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
You are not a good person.

606
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
I'm not a good person.

607
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Your two black-tongued lunches are ready.

608
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
You go to the police station first.

609
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Then you can give me the lunch box.

610
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I'll go.

611
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Or the president will kick you out.

612
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
I'll go to the police station.

613
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
This is the most important one.

614
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
I can't go home.

615
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
I'll go to the police station.

616
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
Thank you.

617
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Your wife is not a good person.

618
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
She is so beautiful.

619
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
She is a street girl.

620
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
She is a street girl.

621
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
I think you are too kind.

622
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
I'm kind?

623
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
I'm not kind.

624
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
You can't call me a beautiful girl.

625
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
She is not kind.

626
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
She wants to get married to a good person.

627
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
If I didn't bring her here,

628
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
she would have been dead.

629
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Your wife is a poor person.

630
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
She is a poor person.

631
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
You know it.

632
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Why are you so good?

633
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
You're so good.

634
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Thank you.

635
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
I don't know why I'm so bad.

636
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
I'm so bad.

637
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
I'm so bad.

638
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
You are so good.

639
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
I'm so bad.

640
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Why am I so bad?

641
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
I'm so bad.

642
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Why am I so bad?

643
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
I'm going to the bathroom.

644
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Yeah, I'm still a little bit conscious.

645
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Did Chun-la really find out?

646
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Yeah, do you know?

647
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
She took her husband to the temple.

648
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
She said she couldn't take care of him.

649
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
She didn't tell me.

650
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
I was so worried.

651
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
I heard that the patient who was being treated with the disease

652
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
had to go to the temple.

653
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
I heard that if you were sent to the temple,

654
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
you would have to wait to die.

655
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
The police are still on the run.

656
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
They are still on the run.

657
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
She will get better and better.

658
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Yeah, she will get better and better.

659
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
I also saw some patients

660
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
who were doing well.

661
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,040
We shouldn't set the standard so high.

662
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Although she is not like before,

663
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,040
she still has basic living skills.

664
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Right?

665
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Yeah.

666
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
I work as I should.

667
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,040
I can still find some part-time job at home.

668
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Mom, if I don't want to work,

669
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
you can tell me where to find a job.

670
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
Okay.

671
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
If you want to take care of the children,

672
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
I can help.

673
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
If you want to work,

674
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
I can spend a lot of time with the man who is not in the business.

675
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
I'm sorry.

676
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
No, it's okay.

677
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Xiao Yang.

678
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Yixing.

679
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Are you going to get married?

680
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Marry?

681
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Why do you introduce me to a man who is going to get married?

682
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
You are not a man.

683
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,040
You are not like me.

684
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
You are just a man.

685
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
You are not a man.

686
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
So?

687
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
You are not a man?

688
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,040
The people here are all the same.

689
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
I was going to ask for money.

690
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
It's a deal.

691
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
It's a deal.

692
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Yixing.

693
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Wait.

694
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Are you still with your dad?

695
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
I'm sorry.

696
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Are you still with your dad?

697
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
I'm sorry.

698
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
I'm sorry.

699
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
I'm sorry.

700
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
I'm sorry.

701
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
I'm sorry.

702
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
I've found it.

703
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,040
If you are suspected of reading comics all day long

704
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
and then you sneak up on me

705
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
and then you can't sleep for more than 100 times

706
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
and you don't believe me

707
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
and you don't believe me when you sleep next to me

708
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Why do I say that no one believes me?

709
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Guanjun didn't do it on purpose

710
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,040
ADHD patients easily have sleep disorders

711
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,040
Some children do get used to the medicine longer

712
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,040
You must think that I am a father

713
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
who can't figure out anything

714
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
even if I am on my own

715
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,040
Right?

716
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
The pre-reported period

717
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
is indeed not easy for anyone

718
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
It's the same for you and Guanjun

719
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
It's the same for our medical system

720
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,040
How can you be energetic during the day

721
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
when you don't sleep at night?

722
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Your dad wants you to sleep

723
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
That's for your own good

724
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
I'd rather sleep in the car than in the park

725
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
I'd rather sleep in the car than in the park

726
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,040
Don't sleep at home

727
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Don't tell me you love me

728
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
You are so picky, why would you love me?

729
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Write it again

730
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
It's so simple, you can't even write it

731
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
You

732
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040
Write it one by one

733
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
Write it carefully

734
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
Can you treat me like this?

735
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
What's your attitude?

736
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
You, you stand up

737
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
You, you get out

738
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
I'm going to kill you

739
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
I'm going to kill you

740
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
I'm going to kill you

741
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
I'm going to kill you

742
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
You are outside

743
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Don't come in

744
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
I really hate you

745
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
You are so stupid

746
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
for not asking me such a simple question

747
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
I have to tell you several times every day

748
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
What's your problem?

749
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
I ask you

750
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
Why did you take the knife to school?

751
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Why?

752
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
Why did you go to the park and kill the dog?

753
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Don't call me mom

754
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
You don't have a mom

755
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
You don't have a dad

756
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
You can't even love a dog

757
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
I have no choice

758
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
I have no choice

759
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
You hate me

760
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
I hate you too

761
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
I don't want to send you a message directly

762
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,040
But your dad said he would give you another chance

763
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
What do you think?

764
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
I'll send it

765
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
Are you sure?

766
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
If you send me another one

767
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
I will apply for a five-day leave of absence

768
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
You have to be responsible for your choice

769
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Does he have a big mouth?

770
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,040
There must be a friction between the family

771
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
But you have to believe that it's all because of love

772
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
You believe it?

773
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Is love like this?

774
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Your dad is treating you well in the way he thinks

775
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Maybe you don't think so

776
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,040
But you saw your dad change

777
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
It's impossible without love

778
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Hey!

779
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
Promise me

780
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
If you ever look unuddly

781
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Call me okay?

782
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Whatever

783
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
It's a scene with a beautiful woman

784
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
What should we do now?

785
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,040
How about it?

786
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
What about 對这家的新人?

787
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
Let me see

788
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
It's a good time to listen to the news.

789
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
The strong point is that it's a good time to listen to the news.

790
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
The office of the director of Penglai

791
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
and the residence of the employee, Jian Jiaxin,

792
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
and the service department have a total of 58 people.

793
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
The survey also found that the executive council

794
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
and the safety of Penglai Railway

795
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
have been improved by 18 billion yuan.

796
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
However, there are some officials who have colluded with the former guests

797
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
and the representative of the public opinion,

798
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
who formed the White Handle Group.

799
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
This is the nature of the train

800
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
and the road.

801
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
This kind of thing is really serious.

802
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Ah, the questions are all over the place.

803
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
It's useless to keep talking about it.

804
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
If we don't investigate it thoroughly,

805
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
it will be like a disaster.

806
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Hey, I'm asking you.

807
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
You shouldn't do the same

808
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
and do something like a natural disaster.

809
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Hey, you're not a woman who calls for help.

810
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,040
I can't do this kind of thing.

811
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,040
I'm really serving the people.

812
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Hey, you.

813
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm going to have a good life.

814
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
You just bought me breakfast.

815
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
I'm not going to do anything.

816
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
If you're like this, how can you be so good?

817
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
People say that you're a woman of the heart.

818
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
Am I that good?

819
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
I'm very good to everyone.

820
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,040
You're not going to talk to many people as a wife.

821
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040
Just you.

822
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
Why are you so hard on me?

823
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
Every day you're so annoying.

824
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
You're always going to bring me.

825
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
I'm going to bring you some soup.

826
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
You're so annoying.

827
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,040
The housekeeper has already paid 3 million.

828
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
What do I have to say?

829
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
Is it really worth it?

830
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
We only have this child.

831
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
You two are too much.

832
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
He's going abroad to find some friends.

833
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
Do you think you can ask him?

834
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
We're all friends.

835
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
I've been asking him to buy me a house for a whole day.

836
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
This kind of thing is not good.

837
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Every day, the heroine is the first to get married.

838
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
I'm not.

839
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,040
You're not.

840
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
My wife is very strict.

841
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
It's always like this.

842
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
Every time, I'm always asking Linda.

843
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,040
I always tell her that Linda is a white glove.

844
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
She just wants to get a man.

845
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Even if she's put in our house,

846
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
I won't be able to talk to her for a long time.

847
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
I know.

848
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
It's only 40 years old.

849
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
It's better to have a son.

850
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,040
I don't know what to say.

851
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,040
Get this child.

852
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
That's weird.

853
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,040
I feel like I can't get a man who can do things.

854
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,040
I...

855
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
The medicine you took last time,

856
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
if you use it,

857
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,040
it's okay, right?

858
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,040
When did you decide to be a gynecologist?

859
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,040
When I was in the fifth grade of college,

860
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,040
I was doing my internship.

861
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
What's wrong?

862
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,040
Do you want to be one yourself,

863
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
or your family forced you?

864
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Myself.

865
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
What's wrong?

866
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,040
Did you meet something?

867
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
My grandma wanted me to study medicine,

868
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,040
politics,

869
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
and law.

870
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
But I'm not interested.

871
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
But I'm the only hope of our family.

872
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
If I don't do it,

873
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040
it seems to be very unfilial.

874
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
Actually, you're thinking about it like that,

875
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,040
it's already very clever.

876
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
It just doesn't work.

877
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,040
You've at least done half of what you said.

878
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,040
You can ask your heart.

879
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
What are you interested in?

880
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,040
What kind of adult do you want to be?

881
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,040
If the medicine is okay,

882
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,040
I'll continue to see it.

883
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
Okay?

884
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
I'm telling Hu Guanjun today that he's a pervert.

885
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,040
This is too long.

886
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
Mom, don't be angry.

887
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,040
I just heard that

888
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
the situation is not that serious.

889
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
Should we clear things up first,

890
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
and then...

891
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,040
Clear what up?

892
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,040
My daughter is still crying.

893
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,040
Put the birth certificate on the desk of your classmate.

894
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,040
Isn't it serious?

895
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,040
You're thinking about it.

896
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,040
I heard that you're a pervert.

897
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,040
You're going to be punished.

898
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
I can't accept my child

899
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,040
to be in the same class as this child.

900
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Mom, we're here to find two parents.

901
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
We just want to solve this misunderstanding.

902
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,040
Misunderstanding?

903
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,040
So you're going to solve the problem

904
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,040
by searching for them, right?

905
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
No, Mom.

906
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,040
As long as it's proposed,

907
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
the school will definitely conduct a gender survey.

908
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
It must be handled in a fair way.

909
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
I told you that we did it on purpose.

910
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
I just helped my classmate to pick up the file.

911
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,040
You touched her desk.

912
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,040
She said that I was a pervert.

913
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,040
I told her that I'm sorry.

914
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,040
Why didn't you go to the bathroom to change clothes?

915
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,040
Why did I go to the bathroom

916
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,040
to change clothes in the classroom?

917
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,040
So you think that's a good problem?

918
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,040
You're a pervert, aren't you?

919
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,040
Is it so hard to study well?

920
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,040
Why do you cause so much trouble?

921
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,040
Can you let me work well one day?

922
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
I'll see you off.

923
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,040
Come here.

924
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
The public security office will be here soon.

925
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,040
You can get married now.

926
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
She doesn't want to come back

927
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,040
to our country.

928
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,040
I don't want to be too close to my mom.

929
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,040
Why are you so stubborn?

930
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,040
I'll see when you get there.

931
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,480
You're so stubborn.

932
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,760
I'll burn you to death.

933
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,600
Hi,

934
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
here.

935
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,480
You're late.

936
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,220
He's the best

937
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,280
I know.

938
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,400
We met before.

939
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,480
We met before.

940
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,880
You followed me?

941
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,720
Yes.

942
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,800
Since we met before,

943
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,640
we're meant to be.

944
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,400
Here.

945
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,040
Thanks.

946
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,520
Let's have a toast.

947
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Cheers.

948
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,040
Thanks.

949
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,600
You're under a lot of pressure.

950
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,440
Why?

951
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,560
Eat.

952
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,080
Help me get some meat.

953
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,440
Anything else?

954
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
You.

955
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,760
Do you have a girlfriend?

956
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,040
Do you have a boyfriend?

957
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,040
No.

958
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,320
Then why don't you

959
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
try to get back together?

960
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,600
Don't answer the phone.

961
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Hello?

962
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,760
Okay.

963
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
Guan Jun.

964
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,760
Why did you call me

965
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,760
when you were at the police station?

966
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,760
Why?

967
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,760
Why?

968
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
What are you doing?

969
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,760
I'm sorry.

970
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,760
What are you doing?

971
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,760
You're like a pervert.

972
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,760
You're a pervert.

973
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,760
I'll be a pervert for you.

974
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
Put your clothes on.

975
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
You're trying to get away, aren't you?

976
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,760
I've done everything I could.

977
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,760
But he took away all the people

978
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,760
I've found.

979
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,760
I wanted to say,

980
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,760
forget it.

981
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,760
I told him to move out.

982
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,760
But he ran out to rob me of my clothes.

983
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,760
I feel embarrassed.

984
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,760
I'm happy

985
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,760
to see him taken away.

986
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,760
Why is it so hard to find a child?

987
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,760
I don't know how much I should let go

988
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,760
before he can grow up.

989
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,880
The memory of you falling into the abyss

990
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,760
is still deep in the abyss, looking at the sky

991
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:44,360
counting down to the despair that awaits the dawn

992
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:49,160
Flying over the ice, the sea and the sun

993
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:56,620
Even in the

994
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:57,400
pain in the heart

995
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,680
I will never forget the beautiful scenery

996
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,560
I will never forget the beautiful scenery

997
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:32,360
I will never forget the beautiful scenery

998
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,080
I will never forget the beautiful scenery

999
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,960
I will never forget the beautiful scenery

1000
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,760
I will never forget the beautiful scenery

1001
00:51:46,760 --> 00:52:15,480
The same

1002
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,760
