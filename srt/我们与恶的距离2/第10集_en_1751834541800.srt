The most likely to be found to be a murder case is the fire in Qing Yun Supermarket.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The incident took place in late September last year, causing 12 deaths.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This morning, the court of the Republic of China selected the court of the Republic of China as its first witness.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The court of the Republic of China has been reviewing the matter for 1 year and 4 days.

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The court of the Republic of China has been reviewing the matter for 1 year and 4 days.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The court of the Republic of China has informed its court

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,000
Good morning

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,280
Good morning

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,000
Morning

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,800

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:10,640
Pen mercado

17
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,460
Really

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,380
How's that

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,920
Open the gate

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,380
Detective

21
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,380
I'm so nervous.

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,180
I told the boss.

23
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,180
Don't worry.

24
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,380
It's okay.

25
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:30,980
Come on.

26
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,980
You can do it.

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,380
Boss.

28
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,580
Boss.

29
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,780
Hello, sir.

30
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,580
What are you doing?

31
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,580
What are you doing?

32
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,780
I'm a old man.

33
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,580
Boss.

34
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,580
I'm here now.

35
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,380
Boss.

36
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,780
I'm sorry

37
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,180
for not being able to

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,380
see you before.

39
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,380
I'm really sorry.

40
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,980
It's okay.

41
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,180
If you keep being like this,

42
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,780
it'll be fine.

43
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,980
Yeah, it's okay.

44
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,380
Let's talk it over.

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,980
Okay.

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,580
Let's talk it over.

47
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:09,980
Okay.

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,180
Let's talk it over.

49
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,780
Okay.

50
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,980
I won't take it.

51
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,380
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,180
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,180
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,980
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,780
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,580
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,580
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,180
It's okay.

59
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,980
Mr. Luo, sit down.

60
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,380
Okay.

61
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:22,980
Sit down.

62
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,780
I'll take it.

63
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,580
You sit here.

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,380
I'll take it.

65
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,980
Miss Xiao.

66
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,580
Mr. Liu.

67
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,580
Young Master Liu.

68
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,380
We're going to see you.

69
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,180
You look good.

70
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,180
Isn't it time to talk?

71
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,780
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,780
Young Master Liu.

73
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
This is...

74
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,380
He's the one who did the interview.

75
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,980
The following few days,

76
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,980
the police will give a report

77
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,980
and the fire investigation team

78
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,980
a detailed explanation.

79
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,180
To let everyone know,

80
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,780
the flow of smoke and gas

81
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,380
will cause a fire.

82
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,780
And the spirit of the defendant

83
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,580
will be given a report

84
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,180
and the autopsy will be done.

85
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,780
The defendant's ability to identify

86
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
and control the situation

87
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,780
is not different from the average person.

88
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,780
And the above evidence will prove

89
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,180
that the defendant is the only one who killed

90
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,780
and is not determined to do it.

91
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,980
The defendant's action

92
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,380
is to kill.

93
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,180
He is responsible for the lives of the five innocent people.

94
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
The official confirmation report

95
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
and the expert's testimony can prove

96
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,180
that the fire point

97
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,980
is the car from the shop manager.

98
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,380
And the distance and direction

99
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,980
of the fire accident

100
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,980
was not predicted by the defendant, Hu Guanjun.

101
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
He didn't know that

102
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,980
after he set the fire and burned the car,

103
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,980
the accident would be caused by

104
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,180
the garbage and fire outside the supermarket.

105
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,780
He also didn't know

106
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,380
that the security door behind the supermarket

107
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,980
was locked by the warehouse.

108
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,380
He didn't even know

109
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,580
who was in the supermarket.

110
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,780
And from the autopsy report,

111
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,380
it can be further proved that

112
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,380
Hu Guanjun was in a state of control

113
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,380
when he acted.

114
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,380
But he was not determined to kill.

115
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
The police in our area

116
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,780
are the most dangerous.

117
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,780
Although I have seen

118
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,780
many friends

119
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,980
come to this democratic dialogue.

120
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,180
I am here to thank you.

121
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,380
I have a question.

122
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,580
I have a question.

123
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,980
What is it?

124
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,580
Thank you, sir.

125
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,780
Please.

126
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,380
I think you should know that

127
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,180
the farmers can't make much money.

128
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,780
What?

129
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,980
The key to growing the fields

130
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
is very risky.

131
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,980
You are here to make trouble.

132
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,580
I have nothing to do.

133
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,980
The electricity is making money.

134
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,780
It's okay.

135
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,780
Can't you do it?

136
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,780
My brother is happy.

137
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,380
Can someone ask him?

138
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,380
Thank you, sir.

139
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,180
I will answer your question.

140
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,780
Otherwise, it would be boring

141
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,580
for him to be alone on the stage.

142
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,580
First of all,

143
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,980
I am not against the farming power.

144
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,380
I am against

145
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,380
the county government

146
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,980
to change the land and the land.

147
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,980
They can turn the farming land

148
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,380
into a sub-country.

149
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,580
Or they can divide it into two parts

150
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,780
to avoid the inspection.

151
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,580
It's not wrong to make money.

152
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,180
It's very good.

153
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,380
But the money

154
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,380
will only go into the energy companies

155
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,780
and the owners' pockets.

156
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,580
Agriculture.

157
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,780
Agriculture is the foundation of Qingyun County.

158
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,580
But once the power is on,

159
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,380
all these will disappear.

160
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,380
The chance of working will disappear.

161
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
The talent will disappear.

162
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,580
Only the work of cleaning

163
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,380
and maintaining the power plants will be left.

164
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,780
And the power plants with full power.

165
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,780
Is this future

166
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,180
the future that our family wants?

167
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,180
I really don't understand.

168
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,980
Why do you always

169
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,380
try to change the country?

170
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,580
You just said that the farm is the foundation.

171
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,180
That's what you are talking about.

172
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,980
You are really stupid.

173
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
You are not a person

174
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,780
who can make this kind of decision.

175
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,180
You are right.

176
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,380
Why do you always

177
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,580
try to change the country?

178
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
You are just trying to...

179
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,380
I am going to work.

180
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,580
You said that I am not a big girl.

181
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,780
You are not a big girl.

182
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
You are not a girl.

183
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,180
What do you know about the old age?

184
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,980
The old age is the first generation.

185
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,380
If you see him

186
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,980
doing good things,

187
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,580
I will be so happy.

188
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,780
I don't have anything to fear.

189
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,380
Then why did you decide?

190
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,380
If you can't save him,

191
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,580
your children will be the same.

192
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,780
They won't listen to you.

193
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
Okay.

194
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,580
Don't worry.

195
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,180
You just got married.

196
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,580
I am going to tell him

197
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,780
that he is not a bad person.

198
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,380
You are the bad person.

199
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,380
Liu Wen Cheng.

200
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,980
You have to eat the lunch box.

201
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,580
You have to donate money here.

202
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,780
How much do you want to donate?

203
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,580
One thousand dollars.

204
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,980
One thousand dollars.

205
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,580
It is okay.

206
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,380
What do you mean it is okay?

207
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,180
You are the one who...

208
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
The remaining four days

209
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,380
you have to save 100 bucks a day.

210
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,980
The reporter from Taste of Love

211
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,780
wants to interview you.

212
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,380
Okay.

213
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,380
Then I will go first.

214
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,180
Go ahead.

215
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,380
Hello, Mr. Gao.

216
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,380
Hello.

217
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,580
I am the reporter from Taste of Love,

218
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,380
Wu Xin.

219
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:01,780
Hello.

220
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,980
We received a news report today.

221
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,780
The press office wants me

222
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,380
to interview you.

223
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,180
Okay.

224
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,380
I am going first.

225
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,460
I received a report today.

226
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,340
Mr. Liao asked me to confirm with you.

227
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,500
I heard that because you abandoned your sister's family,

228
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,620
you caused her husband, Mr. Luo Zhiqiang, to die after the accident.

229
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,580
For this report,

230
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,780
we want to confirm if there is anything you want to reply to.

231
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,900
Miss.

232
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,340
Are you Chen Youming?

233
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,020
Is Luo Zhiqiang your husband?

234
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,300
Yes.

235
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,620
Chen Yan, Gao Zhen, and Guan Wei Yuan abandoned their family.

236
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,820
You must follow me.

237
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,980
Your husband, Luo Zhiqiang,

238
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,300
was killed by the police.

239
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,260
Guan Wei Yuan was worried that Luo Zhiqiang's case

240
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,620
would affect his political career.

241
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,020
He cut his hair.

242
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,860
You said that your sister...

243
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,380
The person who left this kind of information is really low-level.

244
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,860
It must be the news that Liu Kousheng left there.

245
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,940
This is political.

246
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,540
No one cares.

247
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,940
Turn it off.

248
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,020
It's okay.

249
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,740
I'll handle it.

250
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,860
You guys sit down and rest.

251
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,260
I'll rest.

252
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,300
I'm telling you not to bring Gao Zhen to the zipper.

253
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,620
Being witty is witty.

254
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,620
Is she not as special as being witty?

255
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,220
What is so witty?

256
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,580
cio is lacking.

257
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,520
Didn't a gotten married parents

258
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,060
put on a tremendous amount of weight

259
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,100
after virtue family death?

260
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,300
But it is wrong

261
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,180
to know that she will live a life to death.

262
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,220
Mom.

263
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,460
What happened?

264
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,620
Your store is full of reporters.

265
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,420
Fortunately, I received Mingyi's call

266
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,500
before she got out of the car.

267
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Or we'll really get off the car

268
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
You three are all here

269
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
You'll be home late

270
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
You'll be home late too

271
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
If you don't have a good life

272
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
You'll have to be late for the wedding

273
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Are you listening?

274
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I'm sorry

275
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
What's wrong?

276
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Can't sleep

277
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Mom, do you really want to live here?

278
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Yes

279
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Is uncle drinking rice?

280
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,500
If the fire only spread to the front door

281
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Why couldn't people in the supermarket escape from the back door?

282
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
At that time, everyone ran to the back door

283
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,500
But because the supermarket was made of iron, wood, and building

284
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
And there was no partition

285
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
So the fire quickly burned through the door to the supermarket

286
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Plus the back door was locked

287
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
So even though everyone tried to break the back door

288
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Most of the dead were unconscious by the door

289
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
After being sent to the hospital, they were in a state of emergency

290
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
They didn't eat anything

291
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
When we found him that day, we were very emotional

292
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
We kept shouting to kill them all

293
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Then why is it written on the map

294
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,500
He just wants to teach the shopkeeper and his former colleagues

295
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
He asked the lawyer to come that day

296
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,500
The lawyer said that the atmosphere was unstable at night and he couldn't make a map

297
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
The map you took in your hands was made the next morning

298
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
He changed his mind

299
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Judging by the direction of the fire

300
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
The starting point is the shopkeeper's car

301
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
The burning of the next car and the firework at the door

302
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
The firework you just mentioned

303
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Do you know who piled it up?

304
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
According to the investigation

305
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
It was the shopkeeper's mother-in-law who was supposed to give it to the nearby recycling

306
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
So it wasn't the defendant, Hu Guanjun

307
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
No

308
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,500
This is the defendant's conversation record with his girlfriend the next day

309
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Please take a closer look

310
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
The defendant is a murderer who cares about other people's lives

311
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
No memories

312
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Even a proud murderer

313
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
We tried to think about the situation that night

314
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Knives and weapons can resist and dodge

315
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
But the fire comes from all sides

316
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
These victims are in a state of consciousness

317
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Feel the aftermath of death

318
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
After the simple discussion

319
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Although we agreed with the police to use these photos

320
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,500
But we didn't agree with the police to use these photos to cheer up

321
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Now describing the current situation of the victim

322
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Is to stir up your emotions

323
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
The police hope to stimulate the national judge to make a decision

324
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
The first is Chen Li

325
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
According to the conclusion of the negotiation

326
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
These photos can only be used to show the result of the death of both parties

327
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
I'm the one who's angry

328
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Because I didn't take care of the children who died outside

329
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
So this is the first time I've ever compared

330
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,500
I feel so sorry for the victim

331
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
I really

332
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I'm going to leave a message

333
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I feel like there's no discussion

334
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
The more public opinion, the better

335
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
So my story won't affect the abduction

336
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
The photo will be seen

337
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
We were supposed to be successfully aborted

338
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
See you later

339
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Actually, I knew that

340
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
My sister was in the hospital after the incident

341
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
You said my dad was waiting for me

342
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
There's nothing good in it

343
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Don't eat anymore

344
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Tell us if you have any questions

345
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Mom, you're going to be the judge

346
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Thank you

347
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Don't be so hasty

348
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Don't be so hasty

349
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Your time is very bad

350
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
If you're done with the doctor

351
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
I'll send him to you

352
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Now, let's analyze the ongoing social news

353
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Gao Zhengguang, a member of the committee, was caught in a misunderstanding

354
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
He was accused of abandoning his family

355
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

356
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
It's okay

357
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
I'm sorry

358
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Give him the help he needs

359
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Grandpa, don't let him get hurt in the hospital

360
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
The first-aid is almost done

361
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Okay, I'll go get the medicine

362
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Luo Zijun

363
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm sorry

364
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Luo Zijun was my heart

365
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
I didn't know that

366
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,500
His dad was suffering for the past 10 years

367
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
His mom was suffering too

368
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm sorry that he was so hard-working

369
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm not a old man

370
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Huh?

371
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
So, this is a big comparison

372
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I'm really sorry for him

373
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I'm so sorry

374
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Grandpa, what's wrong?

375
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I'm sorry that I didn't come to the hospital for the past 20 years

376
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Why is he so emotional?

377
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Hey, kid

378
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Kid, have some food

379
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Have some food

380
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
You should be careful

381
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
You're so naughty

382
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Mom and Dad

383
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
I'm going to buy some vegetables

384
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Have some food

385
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
I'm sorry

386
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
I'm sorry

387
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I didn't know you had some

388
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm really sorry

389
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Mom

390
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
You go eat first

391
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I'll be back in a minute

392
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
You're going to cook?

393
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Yes

394
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
I'm a good cook

395
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Here you are

396
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Auntie

397
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Why are you back?

398
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
You don't have to go to the hospital

399
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Didn't you knock on the door and tell him that you had a fever?

400
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
I just called him

401
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Okay

402
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Go back to the front

403
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Okay

404
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
The back side

405
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
You see, I called a friend

406
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
I didn't want to bother you

407
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Come and eat

408
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Come

409
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Here

410
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Okay, wash your face

411
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Okay

412
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Add some soup

413
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Okay

414
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
This is for you

415
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Okay

416
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Hurry up and eat

417
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Hurry up and go to bed

418
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
You

419
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
These two are for me

420
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Okay

421
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Li

422
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
These two

423
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
If you want to go to the countryside

424
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
You have to go to the countryside

425
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
It's a little more comfortable

426
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
You can't stay at home for three days

427
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
And make her a big girl

428
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I can go?

429
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
You're so bad

430
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
You can't even take care of your wife

431
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Or people will remember you so much

432
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Then why are we here?

433
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
To eat

434
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Ruoyu

435
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
You're a big girl

436
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
You have a lot of time

437
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Hurry up and put it there

438
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Okay

439
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Here

440
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Drink some soup

441
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
I'll give it to you

442
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
It's safe

443
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Hey

444
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
It's my fault

445
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Oh

446
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
So cute

447
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Here

448
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Doctor, drink some

449
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Okay

450
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
The psychological evidence shows that

451
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Hu Guanjun has low tolerance for wrongdoings

452
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
The lack of satisfaction of the needs

453
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Is likely to cause strong emotional ups and downs

454
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Will take impulsive and unambiguous attack behavior

455
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
And ignore the rights of others

456
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
In line with the standard of diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder

457
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
From the past medical records of Hu Guanjun

458
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
He has lived in his grandmother's house since he was a child

459
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
He was taken back when he was six years old

460
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
But at that time

461
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
He found that he had very serious separation anxiety

462
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
His mother took him to see a doctor

463
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
And diagnosed that he had ADHD

464
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
There are problems with over-movement and insufficient attention

465
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
But the treatment effect when he was a child was not good

466
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Long-term depression and anxiety symptoms

467
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
When he was a teenager

468
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Once he went to rob a bank

469
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
He stayed at the scene and waited for the police to catch him

470
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
He had a self-destructive image

471
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
He beat his family and the police

472
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
It was a state of self-destruction

473
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Plus his mother was seriously ill

474
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
No problem

475
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
And his girlfriend was pregnant

476
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
He was in a very serious state of depression

477
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
I would like to ask the witness

478
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Is it possible for the defendant to rely on his own efforts

479
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Don't have ADHD

480
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Don't be depressed

481
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Don't be depressed

482
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Don't be anxious

483
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Don't destroy yourself

484
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Don't have a social personality

485
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Of course, this is not something that can be changed by hard work

486
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
It needs family and the understanding and tolerance of the community

487
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
The defendant also needs to have self-awareness

488
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Through long-term medical improvement

489
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
May I ask

490
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Is the personality of anti-socialism a mental illness defined by the mental health law?

491
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
No, although it is a mental illness, a straight personality

492
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Or a mental illness, his personality

493
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Even if the defendant is in a serious state of depression during the crime

494
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Will this affect his intelligence or let him have delusions or hallucinations?

495
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Because this principle will not affect his intelligence

496
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
He is easily emotional

497
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,500
But there is no hallucination and delusions to affect his behavior

498
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
May I ask

499
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Is the mental state of the defendant in the crime

500
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Is it in line with Article 10 of the Criminal Code?

501
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
The first one

502
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Due to mental disorders or other mental disabilities

503
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Unable to recognize the ability to act

504
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
First, the witness is a psychiatrist

505
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
A specialist doctor does not have professional legal qualifications

506
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
He is not suitable to answer legal questions

507
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Listen, the witness can refer to the court for the evidence

508
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
The evidence is not sent to the court

509
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
The witness should not replace the judge

510
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Decide whether it is in line with Article 19 of the Criminal Code

511
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
So the meaning of the defense is established

512
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
The witness does not answer this question

513
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Prosecutor, please modify your question

514
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
May I ask

515
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Do you think the defendant is clear when he is acting?

516
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
The first one

517
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
The question is not clear

518
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
I think the prosecutor is still asking the same question

519
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Yi Bo Hui

520
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
The witness can answer

521
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
The witness thinks

522
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
The defendant is clear when he is acting

523
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
After the act, he sends a message to his girlfriend

524
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,500
The question, expression, logic and consciousness of the prosecutor

525
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Are all clear

526
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Thank you

527
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
I have no other questions

528
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
The president told me

529
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
There is a court that always judges him

530
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
He said that the court was closed at night

531
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
And he was still acting

532
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Yes

533
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
But he has three long-term benefits

534
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
He should not be so quick to change

535
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Why is the whole thing divided into four?

536
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Yes

537
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Come in

538
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Xiao Ya

539
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Mr. Wang

540
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Yes

541
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
What are you doing?

542
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Nothing

543
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
I am just doing what he is doing

544
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
No one wants to pay

545
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I am repairing it

546
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
I can sell it to the president

547
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
So great

548
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I heard that

549
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Your father saw a photo

550
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Come

551
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
I will listen to his voice

552
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Kneel down

553
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Kneel down

554
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Kneel down

555
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Ok

556
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Open for상이

557
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Mamale

558
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
I'm sorry.

559
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Is he angry with me?

560
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
He'll come again.

561
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Are you angry with me too?

562
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
No.

563
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
You have to take your medicine.

564
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
We'll wait for you.

565
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
I'm sorry.

566
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,500
I'll take my medicine.

567
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
I'm sorry.

568
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
I'm sorry.

569
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
I'm sorry.

570
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I can never forgive a murderer.

571
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Because of this bastard, my dad died.

572
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
He's a big shot.

573
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
I'll help him.

574
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
I'll teach him a lesson.

575
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,500
He'll be a good son to my son.

576
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Why did Liu Guang disappear?

577
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Why?

578
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,500
My wife, Niu You He,

579
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,500
was a young bodyguard at the police station.

580
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
That day,

581
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,500
we fought over a young man who was under protection.

582
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,500
The last letter that Zhang Jie left to the police station

583
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
was that he was going to make money.

584
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Every time he told me that he was going to make money,

585
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,500
I told him to finish his book.

586
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Why can't I think more for him?

587
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,500
What I think for him is not what he wants.

588
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Don't always think about changing everything by yourself.

589
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Who doesn't want to be good?

590
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Who doesn't want to be a child that everyone praises?

591
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,500
I told Zhao Jie that he was going to learn how to repair a car.

592
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,500
I also said that he would help me take care of my car.

593
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Tang Guang,

594
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,500
did he do it?

595
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
He didn't.

596
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Could it be just a wild imagination?

597
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Just like Hu Guan Jun.

598
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,500
He came to borrow 30,000 from me a few days ago.

599
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,500
He said that he was going to rent a house to support his pregnant girlfriend.

600
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
He said that he was going to work at the supermarket.

601
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
He said that he would pay me back in the future.

602
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
I rejected him directly.

603
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Why can't you trust them?

604
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500
They really want to be good.

605
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
We are strangers.

606
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,500
We have a little bit of reason to do so.

607
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
We shouldn't give up.

608
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,500
We should give them another chance.

609
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Okay.

610
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,500
I gave them a chance. How much do you want?

611
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
How much do you want?

612
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I don't want to work at the supermarket.

613
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Why are you still up?

614
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Come, let's talk with mom.

615
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
I want to go out.

616
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
What do you want to do?

617
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Mom, I want to go to the bathroom.

618
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Go find her.

619
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,500
You can't save everyone.

620
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Let's go.

621
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
His child took the child.

622
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,500
He went to the supermarket to find Hu Guanjue.

623
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,500
He wanted to borrow money from her.

624
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
He wanted to try to understand what she needed.

625
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,500
I saw my wife and child's photos today.

626
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
It's been a long time.

627
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
A long time.

628
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,500
I really can't find any reason to do so.

629
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,500
I can never forgive this person.

630
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I don't want to forgive him.

631
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,500
But I don't want to kill anyone.

632
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,500
I don't want to kill my wife and child.

633
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,500
As for whether there's a reason to do so,

634
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,500
it's up to you.

635
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
Sister,

636
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
the person is not right.

637
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Is he going to make it?

638
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Okay, okay.

639
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
I'll go get it.

640
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Sister, help me.

641
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
That chair is not enough.

642
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
I'll take the next row.

643
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Okay, thank you.

644
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Thank you.

645
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Dear everyone,

646
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,500
I'm very grateful to everyone for coming out today

647
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
and giving me such a touching speech.

648
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
I have something to tell you.

649
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
I don't have enough money.

650
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
However,

651
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
I'll tell you in person.

652
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
I'm willing to lend you money.

653
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
He's really good at talking.

654
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I'm willing to lend you money.

655
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
However, I'm willing to lend you money.

656
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,500
I grew up in a big city.

657
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,500
This is my hometown.

658
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,500
I can never forget it.

659
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,500
I have a good friend here.

660
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
I'll give him a hand every day.

661
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Do you want to eat fried rice noodles?

662
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Let's welcome the first-in-law of the village,

663
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Mr. Li.

664
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
I'm so happy to have you here.

665
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Good night, everyone.

666
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Hello, I'm Ms. Li.

667
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Mr. Li,

668
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,500
I'm very grateful to you for coming out today.

669
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
But I have something to tell you.

670
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
What is it?

671
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
You have to bring Qi Hui.

672
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Qi Hui hasn't been back in town.

673
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,500
He said there's a girl on earth who wants to marry him.

674
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Okay,

675
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,500
what should I do with him now?

676
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
I'll take him to you.

677
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
You...

678
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Thank you.

679
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
What's going on?

680
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Here, have some rice noodles.

681
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Qi Hui.

682
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Why are you here?

683
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
You're the teacher?

684
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Yes.

685
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
It's been too long.

686
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Wait a minute.

687
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
I have something to tell you.

688
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Let's talk in person.

689
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
See what he thinks.

690
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Get on a boat.

691
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
I hope

692
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
your considerate troubles

693
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
and fees

694
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,500
I'm the one who's afraid of the children.

695
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Please forgive me.

696
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
A-Bei.

697
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Thank you for your kindness.

698
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
I'm sorry.

699
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
The meeting is to make a decision.

700
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,500
I have the same right to make a decision.

701
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Let's discuss the defendant, Hu Guanjun.

702
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,500
He was fired at the supermarket.

703
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Is it because he was not sure about the murder,

704
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,500
or he was on fire and died by accident?

705
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,500
The defendant said that because he was unable to control his anger,

706
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
he poured oil on the shopkeeper's car, lit the fire, and then he was exiled.

707
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
It can only be considered as a mistake.

708
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Please think about it with your life experience and experience.

709
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
If there was no oil,

710
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
if there was no fire,

711
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
would there be this disaster?

712
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
I'm sorry.

713
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Please remember these four words.

714
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Keep them in mind.

715
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,500
When a group of evidence can explain several different criminal acts,

716
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,500
the judge has the obligation to use the lightest of charges

717
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,500
to make a judgment on the defendant.

718
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,500
The defendant is of course guilty of such a major tragedy.

719
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
He himself admitted that he committed a crime.

720
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,500
His motive for the crime is completely against the shopkeeper's car,

721
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
not the shopkeeper himself,

722
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
and not those he doesn't know in the supermarket.

723
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,500
The witness said that the defendant was logically clear and conscious at the time of the crime.

724
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,500
That is to say, an adult, a normal adult,

725
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,500
would not know the consequences of the car that stopped at the supermarket and lit the fire?

726
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,500
The prosecution's interrogation record and the defendant's record of the crime

727
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,500
are different from the biggest crime the prosecution said.

728
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,500
The detective also said that the defendant had no illusions or delusions.

729
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,500
So he couldn't have imagined that he could control the fire

730
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
and not spread to the motorcycle next to him.

731
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
He was normally conscious.

732
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Can't he see the white-and-white recovery and toilet paper

733
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,500
at the scene of the fire?

734
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
I beg you, judges,

735
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,500
not to let go of the emotions and magnify the evil intentions of those who are not the defendant.

736
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Please use the evidence to make a judgment on the fire,

737
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
burning the other person's goods,

738
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
and the death of the deceased.

739
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
This is a random killing.

740
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
This is a kill without any difference.

741
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
The defendant has been forgiven too many times.

742
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,500
He will never reflect on himself or examine himself.

743
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
We just want him to know that this is his fault.

744
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
We want him to take responsibility.

745
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,500
I ask all the judges

746
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,500
to give an explanation to these dead people.

747
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Judge him to kill on purpose.

748
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
The court is adjourned.

749
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
The national judge agrees.

750
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
The national judge disagrees.

751
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,500
The professional judge agrees.

752
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
Okay.

753
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
6 to 3.

754
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,500
The national judge and professional judge agree on the 6 votes.

755
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Everyone agrees on this.

756
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,500
The defendant is sentenced to 271 of the criminal law

757
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
and is deliberately killed.

758
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Are you a liar?

759
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
I don't agree with you.

760
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
This is my decision.

761
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,500
It's none of my business if the defendant is to be sentenced to life.

762
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Tell me.

763
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Are you going to let us, the Foshan people, decide to kill the president?

764
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
I don't agree.

765
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
We are cooperating with the police to defend the national government.

766
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,500
We are going to support the president and his wife.

767
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
You are talking nonsense.

768
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,500
You can go to the police station later.

769
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Let's go.

770
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Mr. Sheng, don't be like this.

771
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Yes.

772
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,500
You are just a big boss.

773
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
You don't have to be so serious about this.

774
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
It's not long.

775
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
It's over.

776
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Uncle.

777
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Uncle.

778
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Uncle.

779
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
What?

780
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Dad, you are like this.

781
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
I...

782
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
I told you I have never been to the hospital.

783
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
I will buy you a meal.

784
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
I will see you in Thailand for the first time.

785
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Come on, Uncle.

786
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Come on.

787
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Come on.

788
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Come on.

789
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Since Mr. Sheng took office,

790
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,500
this has been a test for more than two years.

791
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,500
It shows that Mr. Sheng still has a lot to learn.

792
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,500
But our democracy has evolved to this day.

793
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Every choice can change the future.

794
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Mr. Sheng, please give Mr. Sheng another chance.

795
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Come on.

796
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Let's cheer for Gao Zhen Guang.

797
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
There are eight news stations and eight media stations

798
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
that are calling Gao Zhen Guang.

799
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Gao Zhen Guang.

800
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
It's not easy to offend so many people.

801
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Come on.

802
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Maybe he did something wrong.

803
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Come on.

804
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Protect Gao Zhen Guang.

805
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Qing Yun has flowers.

806
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Come on.

807
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Protect Gao Zhen Guang.

808
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Qing Yun has flowers.

809
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Protect Gao Zhen Guang.

810
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Go hug him and encourage him.

811
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Protect Gao Zhen Guang.

812
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Qing Yun has flowers.

813
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Protect Gao Zhen Guang.

814
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Qing Yun has flowers.

815
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Thank you.

816
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
That's all for today's

817
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Huguang Provincial News.

818
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Thank you.

819
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Come on.

820
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Thank you.

821
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Come on.

822
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Thank you.

823
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Protect Gao Zhen Guang.

824
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Come on.

825
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Next, we'll discuss

826
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,500
if there's a reason to cut the sentence.

827
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
The sentence means

828
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,500
that psychiatry has no possibility to teach.

829
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
They can't answer

830
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
whether the defendant

831
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
can be corrected.

832
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
But so far,

833
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
the defendant has no memory.

834
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Let's look at the conditions of the cut.

835
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
ADHD,

836
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
and anti-racial personality.

837
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
These are not the

838
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
second-level cuts in Article 19 of the Criminal Code.

839
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
What about depression?

840
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
The establishment says

841
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
that he doesn't think that

842
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
depression will make the defendant

843
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
lose his judgment.

844
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,500
But what about the defendant?

845
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
The香港 opponetary

846
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
cut defense council

847
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
enters the Lapest shallot three times.

848
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
The defendant will not reflect himself.

849
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,500
and then take a step backwards,

850
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,500
Do I need to give him a chance?

851
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
All the national judge,

852
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,500
please focus onwheel?

853
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
All of you are the only

854
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
justice of these victim.

855
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
usta wy, Mah Supervisor may suitably

856
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
give up,

857
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
but the country can't.

858
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,500
This is the most serious and serious case of the justice contract

859
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
That's right

860
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,500
The death penalty is very heavy

861
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,500
But this is the last line of justice for us

862
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
The police are asking for death penalty

863
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,500
I think life is as difficult as it is in terms of quantity and form

864
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
Please think about it, judges

865
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,500
A child who was sent to his grandmother's house from birth

866
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,500
And thought he was abandoned by his parents

867
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Even if he was diagnosed with ADHD

868
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,500
He was still considered to have not worked hard enough

869
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,500
He believes he is a person who has no life

870
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Because he is easily impulsive

871
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
He is easily hated

872
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,500
He is excluded from the social mainstream values

873
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
He wants to be a good person

874
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,500
He hopes that in the future he can have a family with his girlfriend

875
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
He starts to look for a job

876
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,500
But he is affected by emotional disorders

877
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
When he is lost

878
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,500
He puts all the frustration, pain, and anger he has experienced in his life

879
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
On the driver's car

880
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,500
It's the mental and physical personality that leads him to take a step by step

881
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
The defendant did make a mistake

882
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
But his mistake

883
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Is it really beyond the level of depriving him of life?

884
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
I have to admit

885
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,500
My contact with the defendant was not very smooth

886
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
He was unwilling to cooperate

887
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
His attitude was bad

888
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,500
But these are not the basis for his sentence

889
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Nor is it the reason for his death

890
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Do we really have to tell him

891
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
You deserve to live

892
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
You deserve to die

893
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Is that so?

894
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Please think about it

895
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,500
The victim's family, Mr. Ma, said

896
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,500
Can't we really find the reason for what we should do?

897
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Start the broadcast

898
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
What the hell are you talking about?

899
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
Don't waste time

900
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
Start the broadcast

901
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
What's your child's name?

902
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,500
Wu Qilin

903
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Wu Qilin

904
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
with 84,937 votes

905
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,140
with a vote rate of 50.4%

906
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,940
and in the end, with the same number of votes

907
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,780
with 239 votes

908
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,340
Gao Zhenguang was confirmed to be dismissed

909
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,020
and with the dismissal result

910
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,060
the Central Election Commission stipulates that

911
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,540
he must remove his position within 7 days

912
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,220
Gao Zhenguang's position

913
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,100
is a strong point

914
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,100
change the Convention

915
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,100
Ticket!

916
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,100

Ticket!

920
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
The voting has ended.

921
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,100
The voting has officially ended.

922
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,100
I'm not happy.

923
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,100
For the result,

924
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
I, Zheng Guang,

925
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,100
accept it.

926
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
Thank you, friends who are willing to participate.

927
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,100
Thank you.

928
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,100
Come on!

929
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,100
Come on!

930
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,100
Come on!

931
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,100
I want to thank

932
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
the friends who voted

933
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,100
for the wrong person.

934
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,100
Thank you for letting me know

935
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,100
that I did my job well.

936
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,100
This is the way to believe and support.

937
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,100
Thank you.

938
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,100
Come on!

939
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,100
Come on!

940
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
Come on!

941
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Come on!

942
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,100
Future!

943
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,100
I still have seven days

944
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,100
to be a legislator.

945
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,100
I will do my job

946
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,100
well every day.

947
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,100
I won't let you down.

948
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,100
Thank you.

949
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,100
Come on!

950
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,100
Come on!

951
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,100
Thank you.

952
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,100
Thank you.

953
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,100
We are here to support

954
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,100
the people who voted for you.

955
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,100
We will always support you.

956
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,100
Come on!

957
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,100
Zheng Guang has a chance to go to the mountains.

958
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,100
I'm not.

959
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
Today's boss is the brave man.

960
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
Am I right?

961
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,100
Am I right?

962
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Am I right?

963
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Thank you.

964
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,100
Thank you.

965
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,100
Okay.

966
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,100
The result of the vote

967
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,100
to determine whether the defendant

968
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,100
can be suspended because of the mental condition is

969
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,100
8 votes disagree, 1 vote agree.

970
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
Now we can move on to the next question.

971
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
I agree that the defendant should be sentenced to death.

972
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,100
The most difficult case is

973
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
the sentence.

974
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,100
We often decide in the morning to sentence the person.

975
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,100
After eating, we think that we can make it easier.

976
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,100
For this question,

977
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,100
I hope that everyone can express their opinions.

978
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,100
Come on!

979
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,100
Come on!

980
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,100
Don't give up!

981
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,100
Come on!

982
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,100
Come on!

983
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
Sorry.

984
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,100
Sorry.

985
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,100
Thank you.

986
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
Thank you.

987
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,100
Sorry.

988
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,100
Sorry.

989
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,100
Sorry.

990
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,100
Sorry.

991
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,100
Sorry.

992
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,100
Keep working.

993
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,100
Thank you.

994
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,100
Sorry.

995
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,100
Sorry.

996
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,100
Excuse me.

997
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,100
I heard from Yili that you have a delivery

998
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:23,960
to be a

999
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
manager.

1000
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,960
Of course.

1001
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,960
I'm a aunt.

1002
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,960
I tell you, you will be the first one to vote for me.

1003
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,960
Not only me, but also all the members of the family.

1004
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,960
You are the one.

1005
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,960
You are the one.

1006
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,960
You are the one.

1007
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,960
I don't know how to

1008
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,960
give you a good one.

1009
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,960
You are the one.

1010
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,960
You are the one.

1011
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,960
You will be the first one to come out and vote for me.

1012
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
You are the one.

1013
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,960
Keep working.

1014
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,960
Thank you.

1015
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,960
Come on.

1016
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,960
You are the one.

1017
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,960
You are the one.

1018
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,980
You've worked hard.

1019
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,960
Welcome!

1020
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,960
I will always support you, Gao Wei Yuan.

1021
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,960
Okay?

1022
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,960
I will always support you, Gao Wei Yuan.

1023
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,960
I will always support you, Gao Wei Yuan.

1024
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,960
He wants to destroy himself.

1025
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,960
Is it because he wants to die?

1026
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,960
Instead, he just followed his will.

1027
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,960
I just thought that he was always scolded since he was young.

1028
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
I feel very sad.

1029
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,960
This kind of kid is called Dao Dao Dao.

1030
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,960
He will stop.

1031
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
It's been four days.

1032
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,960
Then he decided to die alone.

1033
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,960
There is nothing to say about the murder scene.

1034
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,960
Do you really think that the truth is in the sky?

1035
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,960
Don't you have nightmares at night and can't sleep?

1036
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,960
I think of his face after a few years.

1037
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,960
I think that we are taking his life.

1038
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,960
If we don't have to kill all the victims,

1039
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,960
how can we explain to the victims?

1040
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:09,960
Because no one knows how I feel.

1041
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,960
Thank you.

1042
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
Keep going.

1043
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,960
Keep going.

1044
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,960
Keep going.

1045
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,960
Keep going.

1046
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,960
Keep going.

1047
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,960
Episode 1

1048
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,580
Sure.

1049
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,360
Don't drink it secretly.

1050
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,560
I only drank it twice. You're wasting your life.

1051
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,160
Who knows if you'll drink it for the third time?

1052
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,560
Enough.

1053
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,760
Come help me clean the dishes.

1054
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,160
Okay.

1055
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,860
Are you two done?

1056
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,860
We're done.

1057
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,060
You're going to be late for the school lunch.

1058
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:48,960
We're done.

1059
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,360
Yu Lei.

1060
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,460
Why are you going to my place?

1061
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,860
You're not going to my place.

1062
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,760
Okay, let's go.

1063
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,160
Why are you going to my place? You can go there.

1064
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,760
You're not going to my place.

1065
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,560
No.

1066
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,060
I'm so jealous.

1067
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,560
I'm so jealous.

1068
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,560
Happy birthday to you.

1069
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,360
Happy birthday to you.

1070
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,360
Happy birthday to you.

1071
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,360
Happy birthday to you.

1072
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,460
What are you talking about?

1073
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,460
We're done.

1074
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,860
Thank you.

1075
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,260
The medical team has joined the external monitoring system.

1076
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,160
The medical team is done.

1077
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,660
So, please send me the details.

1078
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,060
Okay.

1079
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,660
What?

1080
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,060
Ming Jian.

1081
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,260
I'm back.

1082
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,060
You're back.

1083
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:49,660
What?

1084
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,060
You're a good person.

1085
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,460
Yes.

1086
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,260
How are you?

1087
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,060
I'm a goddess.

1088
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,960
I'm a goddess.

1089
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,860
Thank you.

1090
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,660
Thank you.

1091
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,460
Bye.

1092
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,260
See you.

1093
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,460
Bye.

1094
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,960
Thank you. Bye.

1095
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,260
Bye.

1096
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,260
I will never forget your kindness.

1097
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,260
