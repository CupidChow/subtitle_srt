00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Excuse me, which one of you is Mr. Lin Jun Yang?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I am.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Do you have any documents to verify the information?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I didn't bring any documents.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then, could you please tell me if you will be working from 6pm to 9pm on June 1st to 6pm on June 4th?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He's confirmed?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is your quarantine notice.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Please don't go out on the 14th.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you don't feel well...

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You are making me feel uncomfortable.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Don't run!

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't run!

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Stop! Don't run!

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Help! I'm busy. I'll call you later.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is going to be a disaster.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The End

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll take this one.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Are you ready?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm ready.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So is he.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll take it.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll open the door.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Where is Mo De Lan?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mo De Lan is here.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's been a long time.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's not here yet.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's not here yet.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He's not here yet.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hurry up.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He's been here for a long time.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He's been here for a long time.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He's been here for a long time.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I mean,

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
we are going to the gas station.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But we haven't been counted in yet.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's our time.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Normally, people come here.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But...

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The director is here.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll go first.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll go first.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Wait a minute.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wan!

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Wan!

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Wan!

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You have to be there for three days.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Wan!

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I have to tell you something.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We've been waiting for three days now.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
After seeing the director,

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
we've been waiting for three days.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When we go to take the film,

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
we need to take a short break.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think we should think about it.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a pity that we can't get the film

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
in a PC.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We should try harder.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm going to see Jia-Hsiang Beauty.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You don't need to ask for a person's help.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wan!

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to the gas station.

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm going to be a star.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My life is very important.

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How long have you been here?

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How many times have you been here?

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How many times have you been here?

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How long have you been here?

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Alright.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you have money?

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
I know you're all busy with your work

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,600
But we're dealing with it now

75
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,760
We're dealing with something important

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,880
The government has been watching over us

77
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,880
And we're fighting against the central government

78
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,120
We're dealing with the government

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
But the government is still doing something

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,600
We're still doing something

81
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,640
We're not listening

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,000
Li Kui

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,320
Save us, please

84
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,960
Really

85
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,760
Let's go

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,360
Li Kui, I'm not going to let you go

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,600
You're just acting

88
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,680
You're making me cry

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,720
It's okay

90
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,160
That's it

91
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,240
You stay here, I'll leave

92
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,680
If there's anything I can help with

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
Just call me

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,920
It's okay, you go in

95
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,520
I'm going back

96
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,040
Bye

97
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,840
I think we should think of a way

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,960
To confirm the case

99
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
To get the name of the person in charge

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,720
To get the name of the person in charge

101
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,160
If we don't think of other options

102
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,480
We'll be very scared

103
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,600
Right

104
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,680
Call the public health department to do the medical treatment

105
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,080
No problem, I'll handle it

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
Is there anything else?

107
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,240
Right

108
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,320
Our public health department has 80 hours a day

109
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,000
They can handle anything

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,040
Li Kui

111
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,400
You're always so good

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,800
You're always so good

113
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,440
I'm scared now

114
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm scared to death

115
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,960
What are you doing all day?

116
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,160
We have to deal with everything

117
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,960
It's so strange

118
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm just not going to help you

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
I don't have a car

120
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
How can I help you?

121
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,800
Okay

122
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm sorry

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,520
I shouldn't have told you

125
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,920
I'm sorry

126
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,200
Okay

127
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,840
Thank you

128
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,400
Car maintenance

129
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,880
If your grandma is really diagnosed

130
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,920
And she spreads it out like this

131
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Who dares to take our car?

132
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
What are you doing?

133
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
I'm drinking a cup of water

134
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,960
For my mom

135
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,080
You're not drinking it, are you?

136
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,920
This is tea

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,960
I'll take it

138
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,680
Your mask is all wet, okay?

139
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,800
What am I doing with my mask?

140
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm not the one who took the tea

141
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,960
My mom is the one who took the tea

142
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,640
And she keeps calling me

143
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Dad

144
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,440
You just told mom that you didn't wear a mask

145
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,800
The medicine I bought

146
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,840
Is a 1,000 TPM tablet

147
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
It's good for the body

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,160
But it can effectively kill

149
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,680
The bacteria and viruses in the environment

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,200
Take off your mask

151
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Take it off

152
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,560
Xiao Yu

153
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,480
The copy of the human body

154
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,360
Can't be used to put on a mask

155
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,920
Do you know?

156
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm going to find her

157
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,520
Can't you call an ambulance?

158
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,000
Can't you call your tapi agent either?

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
In the face of such a serious crisis,

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the Ministry of Health, Health and Welfare

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and the Ministry of Health and Welfare

162
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
have been working together to protect the patients.

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Now, the health and safety of the patients

164
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
is the same as before.

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The anti-epidemic disinfection group

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
will be implemented in the city of Qingyu County

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to carry out a comprehensive disinfection operation.

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:45,080
The activity of the

169
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,000
Thank you, brother.

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Please notify the people you have contacted for the past three days.

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We will notify you of isolation.

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you.

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hello, sister.

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Do you believe it?

176
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm busy.

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't have time to contact you.

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I have a new boyfriend.

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You are amazing.

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can call him in.

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He is handsome.

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Your boyfriend is a general attendant.

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

184
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Very good.

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He is handsome.

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He wants to go out with me.

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay, don't go out.

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Bye.

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The new medical care project

190
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
has been assigned.

191
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Remember to check the system.

192
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is it more important

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to meet with the confirmed case

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
than to come to the suicide risk case?

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I have 70 mental illness cases.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hello, sister.

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Sister Hua.

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why did you call me again?

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have something to tell you.

200
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We have 100 hours a day.

201
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A reporter wants to call me to interview me.

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hello.

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They said they want to interview me.

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A reporter wants to interview you.

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You can interview me.

206
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But I'm really busy.

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I can't interview you.

209
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Is it Zhang An Market?

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Your auntie didn't answer the phone.

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mom didn't eat the medicine.

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
She looks very sad.

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Take her to the hospital.

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't wait for the ambulance.

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We can take care of dad.

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Even if it's confirmed,

217
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
it won't be any different for 14 days.

218
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Mom is more dangerous at her age.

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Go away.

220
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Smack her with a trigger.

221
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Mom hace de cu skirt.

222
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Do you tell her,

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
this is Li feet?

224
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Tell him it smells pungent.

225
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Sin бед不是 п значение.

226
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It smells pungent.

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Officer.

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The report from our central market

229
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
has been released today.

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It confirmed it was Delta.

231
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, all residents nearby

232
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
need to transact more shorterUK and got into contact.

233
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,840
The vaccine and vaccine volume seems to be insufficient

234
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,960
So I want to ask the officer to help

235
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,760
See if they can get out of the other line first

236
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,480
Because our situation is a bit urgent

237
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,200
Ok ok ok

238
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,440
I'll check again here

239
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,640
Repair with the committee as soon as possible

240
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,040
Ok thank you officer

241
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
The information you want is here

242
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Calm down, legalization

243
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,720
Yes

244
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,920
This means

245
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,680
I need to take two or three days off

246
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,000
Ok thank you

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,880
You go

248
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,800
Take three days off

249
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,840
Hey

250
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,720
You can go to the hospital to get the vaccine

251
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,560
You can get the required number

252
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,280
I told you to get the vaccine early

253
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,040
No need

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,640
I don't care about the vaccine

255
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,120
How is it now

256
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,200
What's the matter now

257
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,520
Are you going to use a special one

258
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,920
Oh, you're a little bit more quiet

259
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,680
I'm seriously ill

260
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,200
What special

261
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
You're so stiff

262
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,080
That's called a special one

263
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
Is the committee member of the high-ranking official there

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,240
It's a special one

265
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,040
What's wrong with the committee member

266
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,360
Why are you so quiet

267
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
That special one is better for you

268
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,840
I don't know what's called a special one

269
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,360
I tell you

270
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,680
Don't go around in the house

271
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,640
You can call the police

272
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,720
The person who needs the vaccine

273
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,640
The new one

274
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,840
The new member of the family service department has been shot

275
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,000
The police officer asked the committee member of the high-ranking official

276
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,320
To conduct an investigation on the Qingyun geological site

277
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,680
You

278
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,640
How is it possible that the government is so smart

279
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,920
If the government wants to send a vaccine

280
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,320
You just go

281
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,360
But it's not possible

282
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,920
They can't decide the future

283
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,000
Call the government to do the same thing

284
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,040
The government has already said that

285
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,840
You tell them to do it

286
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,520
How can the government say that

287
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,680
Do you hear me

288
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,200
You don't understand

289
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,960
Tell you

290
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,600
Be more serious

291
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Don't be so careless

292
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,440
Don't do it

293
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,360
Don't do it

294
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,080
Grandma and grandpa

295
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,400
Don't call the police

296
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,120
That's too dangerous

297
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,760
Call the police to take him out

298
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,240
Chiu-hui

299
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,400
What are you talking about

300
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,280
You're so rude

301
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,320
Call the police to take him out

302
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
He's been working so hard all day

303
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,800
And he's been doing this all day

304
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,040
You're all waiting for him to come back here to sleep

305
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,240
Chiu-hui

306
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,840
You just sleep with your grandma

307
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,560
Don't bother your grandma

308
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm not a child

309
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Look

310
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,920
Why are you telling me this

311
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
But I can see the news

312
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,120
Oh, that news is fake

313
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,920
Really sleep with your grandma

314
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,000
Why are you talking about the money

315
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,360
Is it possible for a man to go to another man's house

316
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,480
Do you know how to talk about money in foreign countries

317
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,960
You're so mean

318
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,240
You're so mean

319
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,200
Everyone in the whole country knows

320
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,040
Is this good for you

321
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,680
Why do I have to talk about money

322
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,560
It's just a little bit

323
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,760
Or just a little bit

324
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,680
How to get it

325
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,240
They told me to tell me

326
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
But they just said they wouldn't send people

327
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,800
They've been working so hard all day

328
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,720
Don't worry

329
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,120
They're all here for me

330
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,680
You're so smart

331
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,400
What now

332
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Go to sleep

333
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,040
Have you seen the news

334
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm sorry to ask Zheng Guang

335
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,960
Uncle Long was arrested

336
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,920
Gao Zheng Guang

337
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you believe it

338
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,640
I don't believe it either

339
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,480
To be honest

340
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,440
Will the general public believe it

341
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,920
I didn't do anything wrong anyway

342
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,240
What's there to be afraid of

343
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,560
I believe him

344
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,680
Okay, I'm still busy here

345
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,480
I won't talk about it

346
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,000
Come on

347
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,480
Then be careful

348
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:14,420
D Sunshine

349
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,600
Sh servi

350
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,800
I felt I was made to do such things

351
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,920
Ibank

352
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,760
Ah

353
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,600
I drank more

354
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,500
Then probability

355
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,240
I heard you looked exactly the same.

356
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,960
I don't remember.

357
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,080
I was seen by a driver,

358
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,880
Are you reading a poem or having an affair with a girl?

359
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,240
No.

360
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,820
I was moved in theiel and took it to their 라smmm.

361
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,060
Then I went to frontage look.

362
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,020
What are you doing?

363
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,220
Let's go inside.

364
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,620
A-Kiang has already announced

365
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,820
that you can't let those two eat in the same house.

366
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,220
It's so heavy.

367
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,220
Let's go.

368
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Let's go.

369
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
Come on.

370
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,620
Help me to pass by.

371
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Let's go.

372
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,020
Let's go.

373
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,220
Let's go.

374
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
Let's go.

375
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
Come on.

376
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,620
I love you.

377
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,020
You're a traitor.

378
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,220
You're a traitor.

379
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,420
I'll kill you.

380
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,820
I'll kill you.

381
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,020
I'll kill you.

382
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,820
Sir.

383
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,020
It's broken.

384
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,620
Doctor.

385
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,220
You're a traitor.

386
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,420
You're a traitor.

387
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
No.

388
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,820
I love you.

389
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,220
I love you.

390
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,620
I love you.

391
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,020
I love you.

392
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,220
I love you.

393
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,620
I love you.

394
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,020
I love you.

395
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,620
I love you.

396
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,220
I love you.

397
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,620
I love you.

398
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,220
I love you.

399
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,620
I love you.

400
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,220
I love you.

401
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,820
I love you.

402
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,420
I love you.

403
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,020
I love you.

404
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,620
I love you.

405
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,220
I love you.

406
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,020
I love you.

407
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,620
I love you.

408
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:14,820
Xia sold an eight- Šur

409
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,020
Mr. S mijing.

410
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
I know the problem.

411
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,220
We should return there first.

412
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,320
Really?

413
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,920
No.

414
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,320
I'll talk to them.

415
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,020
No.

416
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,920
We just want you to return and rest.

417
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,520
You're not going out. How can I go back?

418
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:26,920
Please, please.

419
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,520
Please, please.

420
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
You go back first.

421
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,320
I'll go first.

422
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,920
Okay.

423
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
You all go outside.

424
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,720
Come.

425
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
The committee is here.

426
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,720
The committee is here.

427
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
The committee can tell us first.

428
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,320
I'm telling you.

429
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,720
This is all political operation.

430
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,120
You know what?

431
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,920
Our government is definitely innocent.

432
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,720
Can we tell them first?

433
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,720
Yes.

434
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,320
Today, I'm the patient who was diagnosed with the infection.

435
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,920
As a witness, I came here

436
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,120
to ask for an explanation.

437
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,120
I don't know this gunman at all.

438
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,520
I don't know why he has such an unethical accusation

439
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,120
that I'm the one who called the police.

440
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Okay. Thank you.

441
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,720
I heard that you and the procurator

442
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
have never met.

443
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,520
Have you ever sued their farm?

444
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,520
We are a country with legal system.

445
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,120
At the same time, I'm also a legislator.

446
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
No matter how dissatisfied I am with the verdict,

447
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,120
it's impossible to do anything illegal.

448
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,120
Now the case has been investigated.

449
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,320
I can't make any more explanations.

450
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,720
Okay?

451
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,120
Thank you.

452
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,920
That's all for now.

453
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,320
Thank you.

454
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,120
I'll tell them first.

455
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,520
That's all for now.

456
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,120
Thank you.

457
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,920
I'm the one who called the police.

458
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,520
Thank you.

459
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,120
Please.

460
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,120
Mr. Liu Zhen Shuai.

461
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,720
Mr. Liu.

462
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Is anyone here?

463
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Hello.

464
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Who are you?

465
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,120
I'm the manager of the corner sanatorium.

466
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,720
You are...

467
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,920
I'm the doctor of Qing Yun Medical Center.

468
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,120
I'm also her friend.

469
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,920
I'm nearby.

470
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,120
I'm just checking her home environment.

471
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
What are you doing here?

472
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,520
I'm here to check her home environment.

473
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,320
Okay.

474
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,120
I'm here to check her home environment.

475
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,720
Okay.

476
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:20,920
Okay.

477
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,320
I'm here to check her home environment.

478
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,120
Okay.

479
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,320
I'm here to check her home environment.

480
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,720
She's in the nursing home.

481
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
Is she sick?

482
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
She's in the hospital?

483
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,520
Yes.

484
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,120
Why didn't the phone jump out?

485
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,520
Okay.

486
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,320
Mr. Liu, please take care of her.

487
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm leaving.

488
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
I have a case to run.

489
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
That's all?

490
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,920
Isn't the hospital closed?

491
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,320
This is your fault.

492
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,120
Her home is like this.

493
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,920
Have you ever come to see her?

494
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Is this how the public security does things?

495
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,120
Sir, I'm sorry.

496
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
You're her friend.

497
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,920
You're still a doctor.

498
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,120
Have you ever come to see her?

499
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
She's a private case.

500
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,720
I'll call her once a year

501
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,920
to check her home environment.

502
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,520
If it weren't for her not answering the phone,

503
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,120
do you think I have time to pass by?

504
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,120
You Chang.

505
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,120
The pressure at work is high.

506
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,320
Hello?

507
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,720
Mr. Liu, please report.

508
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,320
We've checked two cities.

509
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,720
We confirmed the case yesterday.

510
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,520
We'll check all the employees today.

511
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
Is the room in the next room enough?

512
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,720
Yes.

513
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Mr. Mao is here.

514
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,520
Hello?

515
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,920
What's up?

516
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,120
You don't answer your son's phone?

517
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,920
I have nothing to do with you now.

518
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,920
Please don't call me again.

519
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,120
Mr. Mao, thank you very much.

520
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,720
You came so soon.

521
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Don't say that.

522
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
This is my job.

523
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,920
Let me introduce.

524
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,920
This is our commander,

525
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,520
Mr. Liu.

526
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,120
Hello.

527
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,920
He'll help you with the distribution control.

528
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
How many people are there?

529
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
So many.

530
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,720
Why hasn't he returned?

531
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Are you drinking water?

532
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,520
Yes.

533
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Stop talking nonsense.

534
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,720
Why can't you hear me?

535
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,120
What nonsense are you talking about?

536
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
It's the same as the one in the hospital.

537
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,920
It's none of your business.

538
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,920
You can't hear me.

539
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,520
Stop talking nonsense.

540
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Don't talk nonsense.

541
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,920
Don't you have a company?

542
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,320
You have a company?

543
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,520
Why are you so stubborn?

544
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,920
Lu Zhi Qiang.

545
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
Lu Zhi Qiang.

546
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I'll take them to the hospital for a PCR test.

547
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,320
You can't go out.

548
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,520
The people in the hospital are all infected with the virus.

549
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,320
They're having a fever.

550
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,720
The people in the hospital are coming.

551
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,520
I've prepared everything.

552
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,720
You can't go out.

553
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
A Kiu.

554
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,920
Lu Zhi Qiang.

555
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,920
Look at me.

556
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,920
What's wrong?

557
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,520
Nothing.

558
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,520
Let's call Dr. Wei

559
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,920
and ask him to give us a call.

560
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,320
You have to check with the doctor.

561
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,520
The doctors are all infected with the virus.

562
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
You know?

563
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,920
They said they were going to quarantine.

564
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,320
They actually took my mother away.

565
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,720
Don't lie to me.

566
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,720
You can't go out now.

567
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Don't be afraid.

568
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,920
I'll tell you.

569
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,520
Mom.

570
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,120
Mom.

571
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,720
Why are you so quick to help dad take the medicine?

572
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,520
You two are quarantining in the room.

573
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,720
You'll be fine soon.

574
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,920
Let's go upstairs first.

575
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,320
Hello.

576
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,720
Welcome to the Men's and Women's Health Center.

577
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,920
What's wrong with me?

578
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,120
I'm sick.

579
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Please be careful.

580
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Please cooperate with the prevention policy.

581
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Please leave.

582
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,320
Director.

583
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,120
If we don't go to the hospital,

584
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
the patients will really get sick.

585
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,320
The doctor said that the people in the hospital

586
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,520
are all infected with the virus.

587
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,120
The epidemic is like this.

588
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,720
So the director Chen doesn't dare to sign the forced retirement agreement.

589
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,920
By the way,

590
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,320
the owner of the hair salon

591
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,920
can't stand it anymore.

592
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,120
He deliberately ran over to give the young master a beating.

593
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
That's why he sent the young master to the hospital.

594
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Didn't he say that his brother was moving back

595
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,720
and living with him?

596
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,320
What brother?

597
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,720
He's not here anymore.

598
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,720
He didn't take the subsidy.

599
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,920
He's just a man.

600
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,120
I remember that day.

601
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,120
That rich man ran to us to say that

602
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,920
he was going home.

603
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,920
Director.

604
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Just let me go.

605
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
This situation right now

606
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,120
is not that I don't want to go to the hospital.

607
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,320
The mountain police are always closed.

608
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,120
Even the officials can't go to the hospital.

609
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
The people who are usually closed

610
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,920
are our own patients, right?

611
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,720
They are so sensitive.

612
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
They are anxious and excited

613
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,320
because of the wind and water.

614
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,920
They can only sleep like the end of the world.

615
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,720
When will the mountain police end?

616
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,920
No one knows.

617
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
I'll go if I have to.

618
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,320
I won't be scared.

619
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,720
Don't worry.

620
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,720
Why are you so anxious?

621
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,720
Why are you here?

622
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
What's wrong?

623
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,520
Brother Zhi Xiang.

624
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm here to see Jing Guo.

625
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
Bring the mask back.

626
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Bring the mask back.

627
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Guo Zhi Qiang.

628
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Why are you here?

629
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,120
It's Brother Xing.

630
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,920
Brother Xing and Brother Jing Guo.

631
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,120
They took the money.

632
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,520
Don't tell them to go.

633
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,920
I'm sorry.

634
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
I'm sorry.

635
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,320
Go to the hospital.

636
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,720
It's boiling.

637
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,520
They are saying that it's bad luck.

638
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
They are saying it.

639
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,720
Okay. Go to the hospital first.

640
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,920
Go.

641
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,720
Sorry, Uncle.

642
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,920
Here's your medicine.

643
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Thank you.

644
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
Uncle.

645
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,720
Can you call Uncle Tai Hua for a ride?

646
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,120
Your father is a good man.

647
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,320
It's a lot of trouble.

648
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,920
You are in quarantine now.

649
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
You can't force him to go.

650
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,120
No, Uncle.

651
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,520
There are two kids.

652
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,320
They are in quarantine for a whole day.

653
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,520
We have to wait until

654
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,120
the sun rises and the sun sets.

655
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
I'll go first.

656
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
No, I'll give them all.

657
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
I think we should go to the hospital.

658
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,120
Mrs. Luo, I'm telling you.

659
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
What's the doctor?

660
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,720
The doctor said that

661
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,920
the 1922

662
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
is not good for the blood pressure.

663
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,120
It's not good.

664
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
Can you take me to the hospital?

665
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,920
Take A-Giang to see me?

666
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
You can take him to the hospital.

667
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,720
I'll take you to the hospital.

668
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Thank you.

669
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I'll go first.

670
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I'll wait for you.

671
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
I'll go first.

672
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Mr. Luo.

673
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
What are you doing?

674
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
It's dangerous.

675
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Don't be afraid.

676
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
I've caught him.

677
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Mr. Luo.

678
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Calm down.

679
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Go to the building.

680
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Don't be afraid.

681
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Calm down.

682
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Don't move.

683
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
I'll be back in a minute.

684
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
If you have any questions,

685
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
please post them online.

686
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Then,

687
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
send them to the village head group.

688
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
I'll be right there.

689
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
No.

690
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Listen to me first.

691
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
You're still in Zhongshan Market at 8 o'clock.

692
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
How could you arrive at the Six-Foot Town at 8.30?

693
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
You're fierce.

694
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
I'm not fierce.

695
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Think it over before you speak.

696
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
This is not a young person.

697
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Are you sure?

698
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
This is normal.

699
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
You have to be responsible for this.

700
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
I'll be responsible for this.

701
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
According to the prevention of infectious diseases,

702
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
I can ask the Health Department to issue you a penalty.

703
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
You're so clever.

704
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Calm down.

705
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Why do you want to issue a penalty?

706
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
We can't do it.

707
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
How many people do we have to investigate

708
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
in a single-person clinic?

709
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Aren't other countries

710
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
already infected with the virus?

711
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
We've done enough

712
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
for the public health.

713
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
But not all things

714
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
can be handled so easily.

715
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
What do you think we are?

716
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
The doctor said

717
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
it's a very critical time.

718
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
And we're also

719
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
very critical of the vaccine.

720
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
It's not a critical time.

721
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
We have to take care of suicide,

722
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
mental illness,

723
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
vaccine,

724
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
HIV,

725
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
old people's health,

726
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
pregnant women's education,

727
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
and we have to be a teacher.

728
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
We have to be a accountant.

729
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
I really don't know

730
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
why we have to be

731
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
an accountant and a general manager.

732
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
We have three heads and six tails, right?

733
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
If we can do everything,

734
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,120
why should I be a public servant?

735
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Right.

736
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
You always say you want to add people.

737
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,120
You've been saying that for 20 years.

738
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
You don't even have a job.

739
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Why do you want to add people?

740
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Okay, I know.

741
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Everyone has been so tired lately.

742
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
They haven't had a vacation.

743
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Otherwise, I...

744
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Hello.

745
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Hello, Qingzhu.

746
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Didn't you report

747
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
two cases of suicide?

748
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Remember to take a resignation letter

749
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
and submit it to the system.

750
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
You've been dragging it out for a long time.

751
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
Qingzhu,

752
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
did you hear that?

753
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Okay.

754
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I'm not going to sit.

755
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Ms. Shen.

756
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
This way.

757
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
I'll go.

758
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
I'll go first.

759
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
I suddenly thought

760
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
I have several cases

761
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
and I still have time to say goodbye to them.

762
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Here.

763
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
I'm sorry.

764
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
I'm sorry.

765
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
I'm sorry.

766
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
I'm sorry.

767
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Actually,

768
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
I envy you for being able to lean back.

769
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
It means you're passionate

770
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
and you want the system to change.

771
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
You've gone too far this year.

772
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
This month,

773
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
I still haven't had the time to see them.

774
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
I haven't even had time to call them.

775
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
I just called the police

776
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
and asked for a resignation letter.

777
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
My husband is still sad.

778
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
I have to call him and say,

779
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
when did you leave?

780
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
How did you leave?

781
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Can you send me a resignation letter?

782
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
I'm sorry.

783
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
I want to be a little girl.

784
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
I don't even know

785
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
when I became a chicken in the chicken coop.

786
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
I wrote so many dad jokes.

787
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
And after writing that excuse,

788
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
it seems that this man has nothing to do with me.

789
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Your job shouldn't be like that,

790
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,120
and your life shouldn't be like that either.

791
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Everyday I'm so tired

792
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
that I take him as the gas component.

793
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
I haven't even been able

794
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
to get a call from my friend.

795
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
What I do here aren't even that I know!

796
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Mrs Luo.

797
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
I'm sorry,

798
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
The situation was not good last night.

799
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
You record and encourage grandma to get angry.

800
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
I will let her know.

801
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
I will send you the message after recording.

802
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Thank you.

803
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
You can retire after you are a good girl.

804
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Hurry up.

805
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
I am sorry.

806
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I was in the hospital.

807
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
I am here.

808
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
You haven't slept for a long time.

809
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
I can sleep.

810
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
I will take care of you.

811
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
I know.

812
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
But you are not well.

813
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
How can I help you?

814
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
You went to bed early.

815
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
I will take care of you.

816
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
I know.

817
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
You are in the hospital.

818
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
The doctor is calling you.

819
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
You should go to the hospital.

820
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Do you know?

821
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
I know.

822
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,120
If someone comes, don't open the door.

823
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
I know.

824
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
I know.

825
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I know.

826
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
You are sleepy.

827
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
You are back.

828
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
I want to send a message.

829
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
I want to send a message.

830
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Can you see me?

831
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Yes.

832
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
What?

833
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
See if you are home.

834
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
I am at home.

835
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Then go downstairs and show me the door.

836
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
I know.

837
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Or you can go to your mom.

838
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
I will say hello to her.

839
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
It's okay.

840
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
I don't need to do this.

841
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
I am not that stubborn.

842
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
You are in the hospital.

843
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
You are in the hospital.

844
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
I am worried about you.

845
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
It's normal.

846
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Hurry up.

847
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Why do you have so many treasures?

848
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Mom bought it.

849
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Really?

850
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
You are here again.

851
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Let me see.

852
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Your eyes are red.

853
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
You are here again.

854
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:45,540
You can't play with the

855
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
I have been here for days.

856
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Your eyes are red.

857
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Can you ask your parents

858
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
not to buy her treasures?

859
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Go take a shower.

860
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
I have put the water.

861
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
I will tell mom.

862
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
I will come to see you later.

863
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Take care of yourself.

864
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Okay.

865
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
I will send a message.

866
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Hurry up.

867
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Please don't criticize my parents.

868
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
You can do it.

869
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
If the hospital is not enough,

870
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I don't want to come back.

871
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
You think you are the only one busy?

872
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
I am busy and annoying.

873
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Okay?

874
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
But don't show off.

875
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
Hello.

876
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
It's your mom who goes to the market.

877
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Not you.

878
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
It's not contact.

879
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
You don't need to quarantine.

880
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
You still have to come to work tomorrow.

881
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Dad, my hair is messy.

882
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
I am in the bathroom.

883
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
Just fix it next time.

884
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
I am not scolding you.

885
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
I am just putting on your red eyes.

886
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
And you are talking like a radio.

887
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
You want to go to work so early

888
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
and wear such thick clothes.

889
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
You don't need to go to work tomorrow.

890
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
Take your mom to the ophthalmologist.

891
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
I will go to the community to see the doctor tomorrow.

892
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
Tomorrow is okay.

893
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
I tried.

894
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Then why don't you help Zhao Jie

895
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
to fight for the illness?

896
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,120
I have told you so many times.

897
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
She has a lot of intellectual disabilities.

898
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
She needs the support of the school's

899
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
technical training and the community

900
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
to stimulate her potential.

901
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
But she is in the hospital

902
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
because of her.

903
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Now she can't find a place to stay.

904
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Zhao Jie is good at stealing.

905
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
She is also impulsive.

906
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
It is hard for an organization to take her.

907
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
If I find a way,

908
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
I will ask you to help her.

909
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
You are blaming the mental health

910
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
because she didn't fix it.

911
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
She has been fixing it for a long time.

912
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
She needs Gao Zheng Guang.

913
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
You have a way.

914
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
I am a doctor.

915
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
You are a doctor.

916
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
You have sworn.

917
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
I am going to the bathroom.

918
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Go.

919
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
You are louder

920
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
than your mother.

921
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Have you finished writing?

922
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Let's go.

923
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Get in the car.

924
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Go.

925
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Nomi.

926
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Nomi, where are you?

927
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Where is Nomi?

928
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Dad is alone at home.

929
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
I will send you to the hospital.

930
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
I will find another way.

931
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Nomi, where are you?

932
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Xiao Yu.

933
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
Xia Hui.

934
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Fu Zi Ren.

935
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Fu Zi Ren is here.

936
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Fu...

937
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
What happened?

938
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Why did it become like this?

939
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Is there any work?

940
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
The case has been solved.

941
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
They won't come to see us.

942
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
What should we do?

943
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
Should we go in or what?

944
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Be careful.

945
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
Be careful.

946
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
What happened?

947
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Zhi Qiang.

948
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Zhi Qiang.

949
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
Luo Zhi...

950
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Luo Zhi Qiang.

951
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
It's locked.

952
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Luo Zhi Qiang.

953
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
Zhi Qiang.

954
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
Zhi Qiang.

955
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Zhi Qiang.

956
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Zhi Qiang.

957
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,120
Zhi Qiang.

958
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
Nomi, are you okay?

959
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Why didn't you wear a mask?

960
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Can you go and help us

961
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,120
with our body temperature and scan the QR code?

962
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Don't come back.

963
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
It's so hard to wear a mask.

964
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Get up.

965
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
What's wrong?

966
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
You don't have a mask.

967
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
I'll give it to you.

968
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
What are you afraid of?

969
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
I'll give you a mask.

970
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
You can take it.

971
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
Take it.

972
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Sir, here's your mask.

973
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
You take your mask first.

974
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Take your mask.

975
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
Here you go.

976
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Here's your mask.

977
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
You take it first.

978
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Zhi Qiang must have had an emergency.

979
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Why did he suddenly get sick?

980
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,120
He's been quite stable these few years.

981
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,120
The epidemic has driven everyone crazy.

982
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,120
You can just look at him.

983
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Don't keep looking at him.

984
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
I'm not kidding.

985
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Go to the hospital to get a heart transplant.

986
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,120
His heart is the worst part of our family.

987
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,120
What's the benefit for him if I go to the hospital?

988
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,120
When you started to calculate,

989
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Yu Ming Jie and her old friends

990
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
were very close.

991
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,120
After the heart transplant,

992
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
they didn't even have a heart transplant.

993
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,120
So, is there really someone

994
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,120
who wants to help this patient?

995
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,120
Why did you bring me here?

996
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,120
If so, what's the benefit?

997
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Old man.

998
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
He's not old enough to be a doctor.

999
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
If you come here,

1000
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,120
he'll have a chance to help.

1001
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Old people are so young.

1002
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,120
They're so young that they're so young.

1003
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
They've been working for years.

1004
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,120
How long will they last?

1005
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,120
People here.

1006
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
I heard that many lands

1007
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
were being renovated

1008
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,120
and the land was being built.

1009
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Now the land is getting smaller.

1010
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
We're losing money.

1011
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
That's because

1012
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
we don't have money

1013
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
to buy land.

1014
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
We don't have money to buy land.

1015
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,120
We don't have enough money to buy people.

1016
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
If that's the case,

1017
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
What?

1018
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
We're in a tight spot.

1019
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
It's because a few years ago,

1020
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,120
we started to have a lot of power.

1021
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
We're in a tight spot because

1022
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
the deputy secretary-general,

1023
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Gao Zheng Gang, is not here.

1024
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,120
When I was in charge of the management,

1025
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,120
he was in charge of the Ministry of National Defense

1026
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
and the Party of Public Works.

1027
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
Yes.

1028
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
He's been in a tight spot.

1029
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
He's been calling for help.

1030
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
When we were in charge of the Ministry of National Defense,

1031
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
we told the government that

1032
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,120
he and the government were in charge.

1033
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
He was not the one who

1034
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,120
decided to help the world.

1035
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,120
He said that I was the one who was in charge of the public.

1036
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,120
How can a woman like her be so useless?

1037
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
She's been calling for the deputy secretary-general

1038
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,120
to give her a bunch of gossip

1039
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
and give her false information.

1040
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
She's really useless.

1041
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
I'm not gossiping.

1042
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Why would I gossip?

1043
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
Now the government is saying

1044
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
Yu Ming Jie is Gao Zheng Gang's mistress.

1045
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
So you're telling her to be a bitch?

1046
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
You're telling her to be a bitch?

1047
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
I'm telling her to be a bitch.

1048
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
She's a bitch.

1049
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,120
She's not going to be able to handle this.

1050
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,120
I've been calling for the deputy secretary-general

1051
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,120
for the whole morning.

1052
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,120
The secretary-general is calling for the deputy secretary-general.

1053
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,120
What do you need?

1054
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Get the car out of the way.

1055
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Get the car out of the way.

1056
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
I've been calling for the deputy secretary-general

1057
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
for the whole day.

1058
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
I'll give you a car, okay?

1059
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,120
Hurry up!

1060
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
I need to call the deputy secretary-general.

1061
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Brother.

1062
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Yu Ming Jie

1063
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Yu Ming

1064
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Yu Ming

1065
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Hello, Li Hao.

1066
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
Come on.

1067
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
It's not.

1068
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
Yu Ming

1069
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I'm asking you not to come in.

1070
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
I'm fine. I got the vaccine.

1071
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
Did you come back before?

1072
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,120
I haven't come back yet.

1073
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
I've talked to the director first.

1074
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
I saw that there was no food at home.

1075
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
You can eat these first.

1076
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,120
I'll go to the market later to buy some.

1077
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
What did the doctor say?

1078
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
I'm on a checkup.

1079
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,120
I'm in the attic.

1080
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
I went to get the medicine for Zhi Qiang.

1081
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
I'm fine.

1082
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
How much is this?

1083
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Don't count it with me.

1084
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
It's good that you're fine.

1085
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Children also need to eat.

1086
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
I asked the hospital students

1087
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,120
to take care of Mei Zhi Jie.

1088
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
Wait a minute.

1089
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Are you feeling unwell?

1090
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Do you have any symptoms?

1091
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Don't worry about me.

1092
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
I'm really fine.

1093
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Brother Wen Cheng

1094
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Take Xin Zhu to rest.

1095
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
Okay.

1096
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
I'm sorry.

1097
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
I made you sleep all night.

1098
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Don't say that.

1099
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,120
You need to rest.

1100
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
You need to wash your hands often and spray alcohol.

1101
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Okay.

1102
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Rest.

1103
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,120
You really didn't come in.

1104
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
I didn't get the vaccine.

1105
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,120
You really keep a distance.

1106
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Zui Bei

1107
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
What are you doing?

1108
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
I'm Qing Yun.

1109
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
I'm here to see Xiao Ying.

1110
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
I'm here to see Xiao Ying.

1111
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
Don't go in.

1112
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
Don't go in.

1113
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,120
I'm fine.

1114
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
You don't need to worry about me.

1115
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
You're not in the hospital.

1116
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
I went to the hospital.

1117
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
You don't need to tell me.

1118
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
I'm fine.

1119
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,120
What's wrong?

1120
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,120
I'm a doctor.

1121
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
You're in the hospital.

1122
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,120
Tell me.

1123
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I'll go and see.

1124
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,120
Do you have the vaccine?

1125
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
Will you get it?

1126
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
Will you get it?

1127
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
No.

1128
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
I heard that the doctor said

1129
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
that the patient's eyes are open.

1130
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
I told you to tell him.

1131
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
I told you to tell him.

1132
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
I'm going to the hospital.

1133
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,120
No.

1134
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
Chen Meng.

1135
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,120
We're more horrible than COVID.

1136
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,120
I told you not to come out.

1137
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,120
You've been arguing in the hospital for a long time.

1138
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Finally, the hospital let us out.

1139
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,120
No one cares about us.

1140
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,120
Who will come if we don't come?

1141
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,120
No one dares to go to the hospital now.

1142
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,120
I'm not sure.

1143
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,120
There are a few people who use the private message.

1144
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
Even if they do,

1145
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
their hands are shaking.

1146
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,120
How can I see the picture clearly?

1147
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Come.

1148
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
Hurry up.

1149
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
It's very hot.

1150
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
Okay.

1151
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
The next two houses

1152
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
I called them yesterday.

1153
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
They all had a good tone.

1154
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
I should be able to see them.

1155
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,120
Sorry.

1156
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,120
I'm so unlucky.

1157
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,120
You know it.

1158
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
What's wrong?

1159
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Are you telling the truth?

1160
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,120
I'm not.

1161
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
Let's go eat lunch.

1162
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Let's go.

1163
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Your mom said she wouldn't let you in.

1164
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
She said it's my dad's company.

1165
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
Why can't I come in?

1166
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
The director has told me.

1167
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
If you come again, we'll call the police.

1168
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,120
Don't make it hard for me.

1169
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,120
What the hell?

1170
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,120
Wait, I'm going to sue you.

1171
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Let me go.

1172
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,120
Shut up.

1173
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
Let me go.

1174
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
It's my dad's company.

1175
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
Call the police.

1176
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,120
You're the one who's going to get in trouble.

1177
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Brother,

1178
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
Hu Xiaowei is coming out.

1179
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Come out.

1180
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Hu Xiaowei is coming out.

1181
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,120
Hu Xiaowei.

1182
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,120
Lin Yanyu.

1183
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,120
I'm the first child of the mother.

1184
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,120
February 28, 109.

1185
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
Be brave.

1186
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Be good.

1187
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,120
Luo Meizhi, please get in the car.

1188
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,120
Uncle, Heng, I'm home.

1189
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
Sir,

1190
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,120
Come back!

1191
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Uncle, you understand?

1192
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,120
I'm going to die.

1193
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,120
Come back!

1194
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
Go!

1195
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
Fu Zhi Ren!

1196
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
I'm not lying!

1197
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,120
I'm not lying!

1198
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,120
I'm not lying!

1199
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,120
I'm not lying!

1200
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,120
I'm going to tell the police!

1201
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Don't come over.

1202
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,120
Brother Cheng Yang, what are you doing here?

1203
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,120
I'm not here to help Fu Zhi Ren.

1204
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,120
No, what are you doing here?

1205
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,120
I'm going to go.

1206
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,120
I'm going to the country.

1207
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,120
You're going to die or you're going to be a child.

1208
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,120
I'm going to send a letter to the police to take you back.

1209
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,120
Wait a minute.

1210
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,120
I'll call your mother and take you back.

1211
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,120
Don't call our family.

1212
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,120
Don't call anyone to arrest me.

1213
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,120
Don't call anyone to arrest me.

1214
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,120
Don't call our family.

1215
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,120
Don't call our family.

1216
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,120
Fu Zhi Ren!

1217
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,120
Fu Zhi Ren!

1218
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,120
You're the one who did it!

1219
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,120
You're the one who did it!

1220
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,120
You're the one who took my daughter away, right?

1221
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Fu Zhi Ren!

1222
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,120
You're the one who did it!

1223
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,120
Stop!

1224
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,120
Brother, my mother did it.

1225
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,120
Brother, you did it.

1226
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
I'm sorry.

1227
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,120
I believe the sky will soon be bright

1228
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,120
and the sky will not be long

1229
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,120
Even if the rain is over

1230
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:21,120
and the sky is just a flower

1231
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:27,120
I will not be lonely when I am hurt

1232
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,840
Don't blow away the

1233
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,840
Don't blow away the

1234
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:53,120
Don't be afraid of disappearing

1235
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,120
You don't have to live

1236
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:03,120
Just like what they said

1237
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,120
I don't want to forget

1238
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,120
So I want to forget

1239
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:21,120
I want to be the blanket in your arms

1240
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:27,120
Don't be afraid of waiting for time to hide

1241
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,120
Open up your sadness

1242
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:36,120
Hope is in vain

1243
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,120
I don't want to forget

1244
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,120
So I want to forget

1245
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:56,120
I want to be the one you fall in love with

1246
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,120
Let's go

1247
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:03,120
Wait for time to fill the sadness

1248
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Today is the day to look forward

1249
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,120
I never forget

1250
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,120
How clear that day was

1251
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,120
Don't cry

1252
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,120
Don't cry

1253
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:35,020
This guy is not a

1254
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,120
Don't cry

1255
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,120
Let go

1256
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,120
Let go

1257
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
Don't cry

1258
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
Let go

1259
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
Don't cry

1260
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,120
Don't cry

1261
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,120
Let go

1262
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,120
Let go

1263
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,120
Don't cry

1264
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,120
Let go

1265
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
Don't cry

1266
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,120
Let go

1267
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,120
Don't cry

1268
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,120
Let go

1269
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,120
Don't cry

1270
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,120
Let go

1271
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,120
Don't cry

1272
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,120
Let go

1273
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,120
Don't cry

1274
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Let go

1275
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,120
Don't cry

1276
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,120
Let go

1277
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,120
Don't cry

1278
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,120
Let go

1279
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,120
Don't cry

1280
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,120
Let go

1281
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,120
Don't cry

1282
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
Let go

1283
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,120
Don't cry

1284
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,120
Let go

1285
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
Don't cry

1286
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,120
Let go

1287
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
Don't cry

1288
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
Let go

1289
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,120
Don't cry

1290
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,120
Let go

1291
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,120
Don't cry

1292
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,120
Tears, silence, and you and me

1293
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,120
In the memories that are fading away

1294
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,120
In the valley, alone

1295
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,120
Looking at the sky

1296
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:35,120
Counting the despair and waiting for the dawn

1297
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:40,120
Flying over the clouds, there is still the sun

1298
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,120
Even if the world is broken

1299
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,120
One life, one death, one impermanence

1300
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,120
Who can be good and evil

1301
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:54,120
Together we become stronger

1302
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:59,120
Before the prayer, get used to the darkness

1303
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Slowly light up the hope

1304
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Ordinary dreams are hope

1305
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:11,120
In the corner, the stubborn faith

1306
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,120
Listen to a song to resist

1307
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:29,120
A year ago, we were all forgotten

1308
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:35,120
When the story is only a tragedy

1309
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,120
We were all forgotten here

1310
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,120
Tears, silence, and you and me

1311
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,120
In the memories that are fading away

1312
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,120
In the valley, alone

1313
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,120
Looking at the sky

1314
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,120
Counting the despair and waiting for the dawn

1315
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:04,120
Flying over the clouds, there is still the sun

1316
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,120
Even if the world is broken

1317
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,120
One life, one death, one impermanence

1318
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,120
Who can be good and evil

00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:18,120
Together we become stronger

1320
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:23,120
Before the prayer, get used to the darkness

1321
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,120
Slowly light up the hope

1322
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,120
Ordinary dreams are hope

1323
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:33,120
In the corner, the stubborn faith

1324
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,120
Listen to a song to resist
