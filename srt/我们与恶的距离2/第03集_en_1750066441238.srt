1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
1 hour before the demonstration

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Honglai Railway Bureau is currently in the Qingming Railway Station.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The accident occurred in the whole of Tianchun.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
One of the nine injured people, Gao Meiling,

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
has been injured for two days.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is the last time

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that the accident has caused a death of four people.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Gao Meiling is the public of the five-party

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and Qingming County's deputy mayor, Gao Zhang Yumin.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Today afternoon, Gao Zhang Yumin

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
will be at the service center and will hold a press conference.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He will be released from the party and will be killed.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The police have already sent a message.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The three of them said that the party's army

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
will be released from the party

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and will be released from the party.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Honglai Railway Station

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
has not even been done.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Honglai Railway Station is a big city.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Even the government

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is basically a city.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The Honglai Railway Station is a city.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it a good place?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think it's better to have a little bit of space.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We are not that small.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We are not that small.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We are not that small.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Honglai Railway Station

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
is a city.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What are you doing?

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What are you doing?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What are you doing?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You are the first one.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I am Xu Xinzhu.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Xu Xinzhu, give me a hand.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What are you doing?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I am going to the station.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I am going to the station.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am going to the station.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I am going to the station.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am going to the station.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ma'am, what are you doing?

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you doing?

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I am the one who is sitting here now.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ma'am, please.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Please, let me go and tell the police.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Ma'am, please.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I am going to the station.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You are so stupid.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You are so stupid.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You are giving me a job.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What are you doing?

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am going to the station.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You are so stupid.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You are so stupid.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You are so smart.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You are not a smart person.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are talking about things.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am going to the station.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I am not talking.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you doing?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I...

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Ma'am,

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have to go to the station.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will be there soon.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Captain Gao.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Captain Gao.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What time is it?

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You can stay at home.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I have to help you out these days.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will sleep with Zheng Guang.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No need.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will write you a letter.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I will write it.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's go.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Sir!

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Sir!

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What are you doing?

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to the police station.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Be careful.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's fun. I want to play again.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Are you kidding me?

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's okay, mom.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't want to be here. Why don't you listen to me?

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going to the police station.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't be afraid.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm going to the police station.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to the police station.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going to the police station.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't!

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't run away!

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mom is a 21-year-old.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll go first.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm just 11 years old.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I want to tell you something.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Last time Wen Lin told me.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Look.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I've already told her before.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've told her before.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm going to the police station.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm going to the police station.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm going to the police station.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm going to the police station.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hello.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Are you a teacher?

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't know.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't know.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't know.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Tell me.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What? I don't know.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't know.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm going to the police station.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm going to the police station.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't be afraid.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't be afraid.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hello.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hello.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Wen Lin.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We're going to the police station.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why haven't you gone yet?

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hello.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to call the doctor.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm going to call the doctor.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Are you a teacher?

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll send you a message.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll send you a message.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay?

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hello.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I came here by accident.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He's not around.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Why are you still there?

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He says we should attack.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's not around.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
don't come any closer.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't come any closer.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He's not around.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't stay behind.

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't move, please.

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's not over.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't get a close call.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Stop is the safe.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Are you okay? What happened to you?

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I just wanted to take a shower.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Did I scare him?

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The young master came in last night.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He ate the key, but didn't shower.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No one can persuade him.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Our patients are all cute.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But you came in and met the king of the world.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You won't be in the mental class anymore, right?

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm so lucky to meet the king.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's not certain.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I got scared the first day, but I fell into the wrong mountain.

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I was only 20 years old.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Today, you showed a wonderful performance.

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're so lucky.

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I was scared.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What happened to you?

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did you have a date?

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're a student.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Do you feel better after the date?

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is the treatment easier?

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Not necessarily.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But the patient doesn't want to come in.

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He needs to spend a lot of effort to relieve his stress.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can fix the broken things.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you know how hard it is to fix the broken things?

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's hard for us.

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We're going to finish the drink.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Guan Jun, you can talk here.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll be right back.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You can't run away.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you okay, mom?

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm fine.

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Then, this is the report.

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can play with this.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Sure.

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But you have to play with it.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay.

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This number indicates that you and Guan Jun's teacher are together.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I see that his score is more than normal for children with a little bit of control and concentration.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We suspect that he has ADHD.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Is it possible to take medicine for him?

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Guan Jun is only 6 years old.

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Before discussing medicine, we'll check his surrounding environment and pressure source.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If we can't fix it, we'll discuss medicine.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Go, go.

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Come on, let's drink.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What's wrong?

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm afraid I'll get a cold.

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm fine.

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay.

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What's wrong?

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Are you okay?

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Come on, drink.

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay, drink.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're so drunk.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We're going to make a drink.

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We're going to make a drink.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you have any idea what kind of drink you want?

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't know.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm a little drunk.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm not sure.

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're a little drunk.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't want to drink a cup of tea.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm not drunk.

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't want to drink a cup of tea.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't want to drink a cup of tea.

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't want to drink a cup of tea.

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We're going to make a drink.

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm going to represent the country and the country.

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're right.

222
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The country is a country that is good for you.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You marry and go to a place.

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And when you're married,

225
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you can live in a house like this.

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can't even afford to live in a house.

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not going to talk about the country's business.

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You have to think about the country.

229
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If you don't think about it,

230
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you can live in the country's land.

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's right.

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I think the country's land is not a real country.

233
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think it's a real country.

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's a country that is good for you.

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You have to go to the government now.

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you think?

237
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There's nothing you can do about it.

238
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're talking about the country.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You're talking about the country's people.

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You don't think that the country's people are better than you.

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's right.

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think the country's people are better than you.

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think the country's people are better than you.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Right?

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Did you take the phone?

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes.

247
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Qi Wei.

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Do you remember the phone number?

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I remember.

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
How is it?

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Is there any medicine?

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, there is.

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I just went to the clinic.

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Does it hurt?

256
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No.

257
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's okay.

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What's the matter now?

259
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Nothing.

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We've been to the capital.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They said that the government is looking at it.

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They don't know.

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's okay.

264
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The country is not a real country.

265
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
People are not a real country.

266
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The government is not a real country.

267
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Right?

268
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know.

269
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I just went to the hospital to check the doctor.

270
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay.

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The country is not a real country.

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The country is not a real country.

273
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What's wrong with you?

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What's wrong?

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm just saying that I'm angry.

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What's wrong?

277
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Qi Wei is being bullied.

278
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I can't continue this drama.

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't pull me.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's nothing.

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We don't know how to deal with it.

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We're so bullied.

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm so sorry.

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Mr. Xu.

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Mrs. Xu.

286
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mrs. Xu.

287
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Where's your dad?

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Where's your dad?

289
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Is he coming?

290
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
We've been bullied by the Chinese champion every time.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How many times?

292
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He's been here since the day he got up.

293
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Please.

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Please.

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
How can the Chinese champion be bullied?

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Mr. Xu.

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why are you bullying me?

298
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Two kids used to play with each other.

299
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Today, the champion was forced to play with each other.

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The doctor said that we should check our mental health.

301
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The boy was playing with him.

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He was not angry.

303
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What's wrong?

304
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you know what happened?

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The champion was first attacked.

306
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The champion was only attacked by the men.

307
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The men were talking.

308
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't want to talk to you.

309
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The champion is working.

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He's busy.

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Are you saying that I'm not working?

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not working.

313
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
How can you bully me?

314
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You're a kid.

315
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm leaving.

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Sorry.

317
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What are you doing?

318
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm going to the hospital.

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What's wrong?

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't hit me.

321
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Take it.

322
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's good.

323
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's good.

324
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's good.

325
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Uncle, I want to ask you something.

326
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Do you think you're afraid of the god?

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Do you think the god and the champion should respect each other?

328
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What do you mean?

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're now a young woman.

330
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're not happy, sad, tired, or in a bad mood.

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But you know, there are people who say you're a bad guy.

332
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're the one who's going to die.

333
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'll take care of this.

334
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Uncle, we don't have a brand.

335
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We must make a brand.

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We don't need to make a brand.

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But I think we should make a brand.

338
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Sister, you're a little girl.

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're a good girl.

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You're a little girl.

341
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You're a little girl.

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're a little girl.

343
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You're a good girl.

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You're a good girl.

345
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Wait.

346
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We don't give you a grade grade.

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
ız sister.

348
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:36,120
Why would you let Uncle

349
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,100
SionFunc in 7, uh?

350
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Hey, auntie, are you feeling better?

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes.

352
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're back.

353
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Give me the phone.

354
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll get you some tea.

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Call the informer.

356
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't call me.

357
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm not calling you anytime.

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I see.

359
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I heard that you have a player from Japan who is very good at playing the piano.

360
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You were the one who asked me to come back.

361
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can do it.

362
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I hope you can learn more about the technique.

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Don't be so busy.

364
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm not a good player.

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm not a good player.

366
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm just a good player.

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm just a good player.

368
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm just a good player.

369
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm not a good player.

370
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm just a good player.

371
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hello?

372
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What?

373
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The guitar is playing.

374
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll be right back.

375
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're the champion.

376
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The problem is to solve it from the bottom.

377
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't find the solution.

378
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I can work on it.

379
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
In ten hours, Women rush Strict бы.

380
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This is wonderful.

381
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Forced.

382
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And the body.

383
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Slowly.

384
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It就可以 certified the었다.

385
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You haven't paid me yet.

386
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You're not only good at reading and making money.

387
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What else do you know?

388
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll teach you something else.

389
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Money is for your children to eat and read.

390
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You can't just ask me to take the money.

391
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You can't just give me a few thousand dollars.

392
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll give you a pack of books and a half of money.

393
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll give you a few more.

394
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll give you a pack of books and clothes.

395
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll give you a pack of money.

396
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You can't spend money on your own.

397
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Have some tea.

398
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you take care of children?

399
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yes, you take care of them.

400
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Have you cooked?

401
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm not good at anything.

402
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're the best.

403
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I've been eating and drinking for a long time.

404
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm not good at anything.

405
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You're a good cook.

406
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're a good cook.

407
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm a good cook.

408
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I can't understand what you're doing.

409
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm a good cook.

410
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're a good cook.

411
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I've seen millions of people.

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You live in my parents' house.

413
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Do you give them good looks every day?

414
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What good looks?

415
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What good looks?

416
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll give you a pack of books and a half of money.

417
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Did youゥ see a左 high position?

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Not talking about top status.

419
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hey you!

420
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What are you doing?

421
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Came here today!

422
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What are you doing?

423
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What's wrong with you?

424
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I have friends, you know them.

425
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I clean cars properly.

426
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Why didn't you look for them?

427
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,840
That's very sorry...

428
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,480
I couldn't resist.

429
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
And what happened?

430
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,200
在後面

431
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,160
不要動

432
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,640
走開

433
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,360
Maw or Anna

434
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,960
My children, we should operate some more

435
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,280
in order to...

436
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
keep them safe

437
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,280
starved you open our house

438
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,920
as if we're following the rules

439
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,280
Did you buy this wine?

440
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,800
There's no wine in my dad's house

441
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,040
I asked you to take it home

442
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,000
I bought a small hot judgments

443
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,060
Drink this.

444
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,860
Hey, who are you?

445
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,200
My wife.

446
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,960
We must wait for a little while.

447
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,640
Now that Food will float in the sea,

448
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,300
Do you think it's still something like this?

449
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,300
What good will I have to come here?

450
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,500
She said she'd follow me and go easy on her عن.

451
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Auntie, we have to go to the hospital.

452
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
What if we tell you to go to the hospital?

453
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
I'll go to the hospital.

454
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
What's the matter?

455
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
What's the matter?

456
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
This is the case.

457
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
If you don't tell me the truth, I'll go to the hospital.

458
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
The hospital is closed.

459
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Mr. Li.

460
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
What's the matter?

461
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Thank you.

462
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
You're welcome.

463
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
How are you?

465
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
I don't want to see you again.

466
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
I don't know who's going to see you again.

467
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,500
I'm telling you, I'm going to be a good girl.

468
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
What do you mean?

469
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Nothing.

470
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
You don't know who's going to see you again.

471
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
You know his mouth is the one.

472
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I'll be the one to help you before you die.

473
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
I'll eat and sleep with you.

474
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I'll be the one to help you.

475
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
I know.

476
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
I know.

477
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
My parents are so generous to you.

478
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,500
They should have told me.

479
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I have something to ask you.

480
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
What's the matter?

481
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Have you ever been hurt?

482
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Tell me.

483
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Yes.

484
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
It's you.

485
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
I knew it was you.

486
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
How did you know?

487
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
I saw my friend telling me.

488
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
I'm sorry.

489
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
I'll be the one to help you.

490
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I'll be the one to help you.

491
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
I'll be the one to help you.

492
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I'm sorry.

493
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Xiaoya.

494
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
What's the matter?

495
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
I'm a doctor.

496
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
I'm not going to be a doctor.

497
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
I'm going to be a good girl.

498
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
I'm going to be a good girl.

499
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
I'm going to be a good girl.

500
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
I'll tell you what you want to do.

501
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
You can talk to the doctor.

502
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
I'll tell him too.

503
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Bye.

504
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
What's the matter?

505
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Bye.

506
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Don't put pressure on me.

507
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
I'm just giving him some advice.

508
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
I'm just giving him some advice.

509
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Advice is the most important thing.

510
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
He's not listening to you.

511
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
A patient said

512
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
when he's depressed,

513
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,500
the toilet and the toilet are going to absorb a lot of energy.

514
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
At least it won't affect his family.

515
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
He's not feeling guilty.

516
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
You know, it's very difficult for them to make a decision.

517
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Give him some more time.

518
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
It might be a medical action.

519
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
The symptoms we see

520
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,500
are the sharpness of the ice.

521
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
You have to find your own ice

522
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
and the one who's sick.

523
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Only then can you break the ice.

524
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
We're going to the airport.

525
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,500
We're going to the airport to get a ride.

526
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
It's so beautiful.

527
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
But we're going to the airport

528
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
to see the sky.

529
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
So we can't see the sky.

530
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
We can't see the sky.

531
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
We can't see the sky.

532
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
We can't see the sky.

533
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
But we can't see the sky.

534
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
I'm a driver.

535
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Driver, please take care of yourself.

536
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
I want to drive.

537
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
I want to drive.

538
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
You're driving.

539
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
You're driving.

540
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
You're driving.

541
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
You're driving.

542
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
You're driving.

543
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
I'm driving.

544
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Há, há.

545
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Hi, how are you?

546
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Nice to meet you.

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Hi.

548
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Ok.

549
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Hi.

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Ok.

552
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Back off.

553
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
How to drive it?

554
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
One hand.

555
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
How many laps does it take?

556
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Please.

557
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Please!

558
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
You two go to the car and we'll go to the house

559
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
You don't have to go to the house, you can go to the toilet

560
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Yuan, we don't have to go to the toilet

561
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
We just go to the toilet

562
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
We have to go to the toilet

563
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
I don't want to go, you go

564
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
You have to take the towel

565
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Sir!

566
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Sir, you are here

567
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Yes

568
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Jialin, what's your name?

569
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
My name is Yiren

570
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
I am a nurse

571
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
I am a nurse

572
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
What are you talking about?

573
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
What do you want?

574
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
People are not allowed to eat

575
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
I am a very old nurse

576
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
I am a nurse

577
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
I am a nurse

578
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
What did you say?

579
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
I have a new nurse

580
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
I am a nurse

581
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I have a lot of experience

582
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
He is not as strong as you

583
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
You are not a good person

584
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
You are a man

585
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
I saw a little mountain outside

586
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
There are only two

587
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
He is a nurse

588
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Hello, madam

589
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Sorry, we haven't started the business yet

590
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
I am a nurse

591
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
May I ask

592
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
May I ask

593
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Can you sign this certificate?

594
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Yes, sir

595
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Okay

596
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
You are a nurse

597
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
I have more money to do this business

598
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
It's not money

599
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
I am 30 years old

600
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
I am not young

601
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
I am not young

602
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
I am not a girl

603
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Why do you keep following me?

604
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Why do you keep following me?

605
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I will give you money

606
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
It's a loan

607
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
I will give it back

608
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
When did you give it back?

609
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
30 years old

610
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
I can buy a second-hand machine

611
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
I don't need to watch other people's work

612
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Impossible

613
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Someone just retired

614
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
He retired a lot

615
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
I will make it for him

616
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
He is our boss

617
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
You don't have to worry about me

618
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
Now you are in a bad mood

619
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
You are not fit to work

620
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
You really don't want people to look down on you

621
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
You should go to other people's work

622
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Okay, you should go to bed

623
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
We will think about what to do

624
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Okay?

625
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Drink less

626
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
The Notice

627
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Today was beforehand

628
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:40,900
The Earthquake

629
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
How long have you been in the community?

630
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
We have an impoverished area

631
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
We are the first ones to know.

632
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
I think that apart from the women's vote,

633
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
we should think of ways to attract young groups.

634
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
That's right.

635
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,500
You should go to the TV show to vote for young people.

636
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Yes, the media's image is the best.

637
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
But we are the ones who are not good enough.

638
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
We are not lucky.

639
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
That's right.

640
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Yiren, you should bring us to the police station

641
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
and let us know if we have the chance.

642
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,500
We will have to wait for you.

643
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
You go to the police station.

644
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Excuse me.

645
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Ms. He, can you put this on?

646
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
What's wrong?

647
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
You should be here.

648
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
I'm afraid that people will say that you are not related.

649
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
What are you saying?

650
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
I'm taking care of a friend of yours.

651
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,500
He has a lot of mental and mental issues.

652
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,500
You should go to the police station and let us know if you are not related.

653
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
You should be here.

654
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Ms. He, you are a teacher and a teacher.

655
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
You should be here.

656
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Please.

657
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,500
You are so stubborn.

658
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
I have a problem with you.

659
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
You want to talk to me?

660
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
You are a young girl.

661
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
I have a lot of money.

662
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
I have a lot of money.

663
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
You can pay me a thousand dollars.

664
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
I'm going to the police station.

665
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
You can't come to the police station.

666
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I'm not related to you.

667
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
You are not related to me?

668
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Hello.

669
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Are you a teacher?

670
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Yes.

671
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Ms. He.

672
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Yes.

673
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
I bought a cup of tea for you.

674
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Look, he is a good boy.

675
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Look at him.

676
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
He is a good boy.

677
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
He is a good boy.

678
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
What do you mean?

679
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
What do you mean?

680
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
What are you doing?

681
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
I'm doing a research.

682
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
You are a young girl.

683
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
You should be here.

684
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
I'll take a look.

685
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
I have a question for you.

686
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
You can ask everyone.

687
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
You can ask everyone.

688
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
You can ask everyone.

689
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
I'm not related to you.

690
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
You can ask everyone.

691
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
You can ask everyone.

692
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
You can ask everyone.

693
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Sit down.

694
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
This is a table.

695
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
It's a table for all the people.

696
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,500
It's a round table.

697
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
I've really seen it.

698
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
This is a table for all of the people.

699
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Let's ask everyone.

700
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
What do you think?

701
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,500
It's a table for all the people.

702
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
It's a table for all the people.

703
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
I think you are weird.

704
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
You are a bad boy.

705
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
You are a good boy.

706
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
You can be a good person.

707
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
You are a good boy.

708
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
You are a good boy.

709
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Ms. He,

710
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,500
you should be here.

711
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
When a good person is here,

712
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,500
why do you need to listen to him?

713
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Well,

714
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,140
I heard that some people in the country

715
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,140
love to see people.

716
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,140
And in the past,

717
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,340
we used to see some young people

718
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,340
going to the park.

719
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,140
I'm Gao Zhenning.

720
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,140
What?

721
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,140
You know who is La La Du?

722
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,740
I'll call her.

723
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,740
La La Du?

724
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,340
Dong Tian.

725
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,140
It's not necessarily your own fault.

726
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
You can give it to others.

727
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,140
It's the concept of a rich man.

728
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,140
What's up?

729
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,140
So hot.

730
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,140
Have you eaten?

731
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,140
I've eaten.

732
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Youwen,

733
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,140
where's my brother?

734
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,140
I haven't seen him since I came back.

735
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
You guys continue eating.

736
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,140
You two go to the kitchen.

737
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,140
Okay.

738
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
Do you want to try?

739
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,140
Okay.

740
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,140
Brother,

741
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
no matter if it's tea or meat,

742
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,140
it's not suitable for me.

743
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,140
Wen Cheng is the general.

744
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,140
He's a big-headed man.

745
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
He's the one who takes everyone to the kitchen.

746
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
He's already retired.

747
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,140
He's the general.

748
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,140
If you're a secretary,

749
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
you'll be out of business.

750
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,140
Yes.

751
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,140
You're not allowed.

752
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,140
You're not allowed.

753
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,140
Juxing Guo,

754
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,140
what are you doing here?

755
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,140
Is it okay for you to celebrate your birthday?

756
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,140
Qi Wei.

757
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,140
Qi Wei.

758
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Dad is here to celebrate your birthday.

759
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,140
It's dad.

760
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,140
Do you have a present?

761
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,140
Here, have some cake.

762
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,140
Okay.

763
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,140
I want to see dad.

764
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
I'll come back.

765
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,140
I know.

766
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,140
I'll go to the kitchen and have a drink.

767
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,140
I'm warning you.

768
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,140
I've already sent a package.

769
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,140
If you come near me, I'll call the police.

770
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,140
I'm here to see the kid.

771
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,140
I'm warning you.

772
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Juxing Guo, did you drink again?

773
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,140
No.

774
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,140
You really didn't save me.

775
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Qi Wei.

776
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
Go back.

777
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
What are you doing?

778
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
Qi Wei.

779
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,140
Qi Wei.

780
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Open the door, Juxing Guo.

781
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,140
Open the door.

782
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,140
I'm going to kill you.

783
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,140
I'm a woman.

784
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,140
I can't.

785
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
Qi Wei.

786
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
I'm sorry.

787
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,140
I'm sorry.

788
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
I'm sorry.

789
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,140
I'm going to the kitchen and have a drink.

790
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,140
I'm not going to see you.

791
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
I'll go to the kitchen and have a drink.

792
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,140
I'll go to the kitchen and have a drink.

793
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
You go first.

794
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,140
You go first.

795
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,140
I'll go to the hospital.

796
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,140
Auntie.

797
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
Yes.

798
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,140
I'll go to the bathroom.

799
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
You're so sweet.

800
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
You.

801
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
You're so sweet.

802
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
You're not going to the bathroom.

803
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
I'm not going to.

804
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
You're not going to.

805
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
You're not going to.

806
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
You're not going to the hospital?

807
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,140
You're so sweet.

808
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
I'll go to your room and have a drink.

809
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,140
You said you're not going to.

810
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,140
I'll ask you for a drink.

811
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,440
Rupez.

812
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,340
Robben.

813
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,140
Why didn't you pick up the seats?

814
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,140
I woke up.

815
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
I work at the shop.

816
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,140
I'm going to ask you to do so.

817
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,140
What...

818
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,140
Why are you so angry?

819
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
You're not happy with your new job.

820
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,140
What's wrong with you?

821
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,140
It's not true.

822
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,140
You were beaten by me.

823
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,140
Why was I beaten by the police?

824
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,140
You were a bastard.

825
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
I helped them.

826
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,140
You're going to marry me.

827
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,140
You're so naive.

828
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Give me a break.

829
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
I want to spend money on you.

830
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,140
I'm sorry.

831
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,140
Excuse me.

832
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
I'm sorry.

833
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,140
I'm sorry.

834
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,140
I'm sorry.

835
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,140
I'm sorry.

836
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
I'm sorry.

837
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,140
It's cold today.

838
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,140
I'm sorry.

839
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,140
I'm sorry.

840
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
Hello, everyone.

841
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
I'm Lina.

842
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,140
I'm from China.

843
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
I'm from China.

844
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
I'm sorry.

845
00:37:50,140 --> 00:38:03,380
Because the boss here is

846
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,140
our first guest in China.

847
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,140
Yes!

848
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,140
Welcome!

849
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,140
Come, this is...

850
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,140
This is...

851
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
It's not back yet.

852
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,140
It's not back yet.

853
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
This is...

854
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,140
Welcome!

855
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,140
Welcome to the youthful and beautiful children.

856
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
Seeing their passion,

857
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
is it really...

858
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,140
Come, everyone,

859
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,140
welcome to the youthful and beautiful children.

860
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
Welcome!

861
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,140
Welcome to the youthful and beautiful children.

862
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,140
Welcome to the youthful and beautiful children.

863
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Welcome our children.

864
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
Ivan,

865
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,040
Yes...

866
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
This memory box is for the old people here.

867
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,100
So?...

868
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,660
Ok, let's enjoy while finding the reason to give us theUSU flying back.

869
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,140
Sorry for being ridiculous.

870
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,140
Do you know how to roam around here?

871
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,140
Look at my hair.

872
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Here we go...

873
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,140
We have been working for a long time to get to know each other.

874
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,140
But we are not ready to fight.

875
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,140
We are going to fight!

876
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
Fight!

877
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,140

878
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140

879
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,140
Fight!

880
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,140
Fight!

881
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Fight!

882
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,140
Fight!

883
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140

885
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,140
Fight!

886
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,140
Fight!

887
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,140
Fight!

888
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Fight!

889
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,140

890
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,140
Fight!

891
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,140
�

892
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,940
Put it over there!

893
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,140
Stop!

894
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,140
The fl buffalo have already lowered itself from above

895
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,760
That houses aren't PTWs then...

896
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,120
The tragedy must shift釜

897
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,560
A surface patrol has also changed

898
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,160
They should stop the patrol

899
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,720
There hasn't been anyzczimecopy

900
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,640
They don't know we have to stand up

901
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,600
We went as far as we could

902
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,240
But we were not seen

903
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
We didn't even know what to tell

904
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,920
Your take your time

905
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,000
Let me see what you mean

906
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,000
What I'll do

907
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,640
I swear that will happen

908
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,760
Lookats

909
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,760
I'm going to go to the hotel and have a drink.

910
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,760
You're also coming. I'll go to the hotel.

911
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
You're not going to play.

912
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,760
I'm going to see everyone.

913
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,760
You're so funny.

914
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
I'm not going to play.

915
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
I'm going to tell you what to do.

916
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
I'll give you a drink.

917
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
This is the gift.

918
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Tell me what you want.

919
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Are you going to the hotel?

920
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
I'm going to the hotel.

921
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,760
You look very good.

922
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,760
I'm nervous.

923
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Really?

924
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
They came out.

925
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
That's good.

926
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
I'm glad you're here.

927
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
Really?

928
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,760
I'll show you.

929
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,760
The End

930
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,760
I'm sorry.

931
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Auntie.

932
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Yes?

933
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
You're going to the hotel.

934
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
Yes.

935
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
It's a good time.

936
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Xia.

937
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Do you have Dou Jiang?

938
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
No, I don't.

939
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
They're coming.

940
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Yes.

941
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,760
I'm going to drink it.

942
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,760
I'll go to the hotel.

943
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Go.

944
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Go to the hotel.

945
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Yes.

946
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,760
You and I will go to the hotel.

947
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
What's wrong?

948
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
I'm really nervous.

949
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
No.

950
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
You're going to the hotel.

951
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Do you want to go to the hotel?

952
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,760
The hospital and the people in the house are very strict.

953
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,760
They don't want to be in the hotel.

954
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
They want you to go to the hotel.

955
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
You're not going to go?

956
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
You have to go to the hotel.

957
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
I'm sorry.

958
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Gao Zhen Guang is a very hard-working person.

959
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
I didn't know that he was a good guy.

960
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
He's a bad guy.

961
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,760
A bad guy?

962
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,760
Do you think so?

963
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,760
Yes.

964
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,760
I can do it.

965
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,760
I can do it with my mom.

966
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Really?

967
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
Damn.

968
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
What's wrong with you?

969
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
What?

970
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
Gao Zhen Guang.

971
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,760
What's wrong with you?

972
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
Are you really scared?

973
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
What?

974
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
What?

975
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
What?

976
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
What are you doing?

977
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,760
He's trying to make me look like a bad guy.

978
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
What?

979
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
What are you doing?

980
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
I'm trying to make you look like a bad guy.

981
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
What?

982
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
He's trying to make you look like a bad guy.

983
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
You're not in the hotel, are you?

984
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
You don't know, do you?

985
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
What happened the other day?

986
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
He's become a bad guy now.

987
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,760
You don't think he's weird.

988
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
You don't think he's a bad guy.

989
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I've been thinking of a way to help Gao Zhen Ming.

990
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,760
He's a bad guy.

991
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
I don't care if he's a bad guy.

992
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I don't want to help Gao Zhen Ming.

993
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
I'm helping your mom so much.

994
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
So your mom has changed a little bit.

995
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,760
It's possible.

996
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
Let me tell you.

997
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
From the moment I met him,

998
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,760
he's a bad guy.

999
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
He has a goal.

1000
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
The goal is to make a choice.

1001
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,760
You're too naive.

1002
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
You're too naive.

1003
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Maybe it's him.

1004
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
I'll tell you what I saw.

1005
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Okay?

1006
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,760
I've been learning intelligence.

1007
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,760
I'm trying to find out why everyone is angry.

1008
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
Have you been missing your mom since you were a kid?

1009
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,760
That's why you have so much to say to Gao Zhen Ming.

1010
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
Intelligence?

1011
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,760
You're a bad guy.

1012
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,760
Can you help me to get rid of him?

1013
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Ask him why he's always making a fuss.

1014
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,760
He's always trying to sell his house.

1015
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,760
He needs intelligence.

1016
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
He needs to grow up.

1017
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
He needs love.

1018
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,960
SOL

1019
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
It's over.

1020
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,760
Bye…

1021
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,760
Gao Zhen Ming, where're you from?

1022
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
Tell!

1023
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Oh, my God!

1024
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,760
Oh, my God!

1025
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,760
Oh, my God!

1026
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Oh, my God!

1027
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Oh, my God!

1028
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,760
What?

1029
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,760
Wait!

1030
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,480
Leave her alone,dim.

1031
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,800
Hi, making parties, isn't it?

1032
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
She did?

1033
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,640
We were late tonight, how could she answer that?

1034
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,780
개를 illness, windflow, half-s Movies,

1035
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,880
don't understand how started it all!

1036
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,740
What is this

1037
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:54,720
five thirty, we will catch...

1038
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,360
I need to go to summer camp for resickets.

1039
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,560
Why?

1040
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,040
I got a lecture with Jackie knowing here.

1041
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,520
Exactly.

1042
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,200
You can teach at the summer camp.

1043
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,000
Why don't I let you join her and chat with her?

1044
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,320
Sir?

1045
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,880
Sir.

1046
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,760
Miss, I did it.

1047
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,760
You're so clearly young.

1048
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,720
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

1049
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:05,720
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

1050
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,720
I'm not afraid of the wind

1051
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,720
The End
