1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
The

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,600
two parties

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,600
are fighting each other

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,600
and teaching each other

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,600
We see that the two parties

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,600
are fighting each other

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,600
and teaching each other

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
We see that the two parties

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,600
are fighting each other

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
and teaching each other

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,600
Many bills

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,600
have been rejected

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,600
Today, we specially invite

14
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Ms. Xiao Cuihua,

15
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
the party's non-division party

16
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
and Professor Wen Wankang,

17
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,600
the North Taiwan Legal Department

18
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,600
who will represent the People's Republic of China

19
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
to represent the People's Republic of China

20
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
to speak out

21
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Ms. Cuihua

22
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,600
The party is a minority

23
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,800
in Congress or the parliament

24
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
So we must use

25
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,000
very strong means

26
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,200
to fight against the power of the People's Republic of China

27
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
which is not as powerful as the party

28
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,800
This way, we can make the parliament

29
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,600
to be in a reasonable and legal

30
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,200
and legal manner

31
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
Xiao Yuan, you have to make it clear

32
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
When the past parliament was in power

33
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,000
the People's Republic of China

34
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,800
just didn't use

35
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,000
one percent of your way

36
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to fight against the government

37
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,600
and was accused of

38
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,400
belittling the parliament

39
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,600
This is double standard

40
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,400
This is not double standard

41
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
What is double standard

42
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,000
Is this fair?

43
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,600
Fair

44
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,400
When President Ke Guangming was elected

45
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
he made four promises

46
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,000
that he must make the railway company

47
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The employees of the railway company

48
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
have been missing

49
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
more than 5,000 people in the past 30 years

50
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
But the number of guests

51
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
has been increasing

52
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,400
What has the Ministry of Justice

53
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
done in the past three years

54
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
What has the Ministry of Justice

55
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,000
done in the past three years

56
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,800
The eyes of the people are bright

57
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,000
How many good bills

58
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
have we proposed

59
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,200
which is blocked by the party

60
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Double standard

61
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,800
Go back

62
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,400
more than 5,000 people

63
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
More than 3,500 people

64
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,840
The number of signs

65
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,800
has been increasing

66
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,320
Możu

67
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,800
can families

68
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,880
have a chance to

69
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,800
come back

70
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
It's almost OK

71
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,960
They have been trying

72
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,080
several times

73
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,840
The baby

74
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,600
It's all right

75
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
Could it be

76
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,840
human

77
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,160
Hello

78
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,360
How's our experiment?

79
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
How did it go?

80
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,400
It's great

81
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,400
The bed is comfortable and the room is clean.

82
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Right?

83
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Thank you. Take care.

84
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Okay.

85
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Mr. Chen, why are you free today?

86
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
I had a meal with my friends.

87
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I haven't been to Kaimu yet.

88
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I'm sorry.

89
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
I just got here.

90
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Can I check and tell you again?

91
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I understand.

92
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm sorry.

93
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Why are you calling me?

94
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I don't need to tell you where I am.

95
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,400
The president of the Electrical Engineering Committee,

96
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
who just got elected, is also our major shareholder.

97
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
What?

98
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
We have a train schedule.

99
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
How do you know I'm in class?

100
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Here.

101
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Thank you.

102
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
You're in class now.

103
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Come and find me.

104
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
You're outside.

105
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm sorry.

106
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
What's wrong with you?

107
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
You lied to me and you're still here.

108
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Isn't that too much?

109
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
It's not too much not to pick up your phone.

110
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
But you ask me for money every day.

111
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Is that weird?

112
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
You're in school.

113
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
You don't have to spend a penny.

114
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I'll give you ten thousand a month.

115
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Isn't that enough?

116
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I owe you.

117
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
You left me at school.

118
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
You said you'd finish school.

119
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I can go to England to find him.

120
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
What's going on now?

121
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
You don't care about me, do you?

122
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
You don't care about the money you gave me?

123
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
You don't even give me the money to buy books.

124
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Your mother has already prepared the money for you.

125
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm so sorry for you.

126
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
How could you do that to your father?

127
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
What's your problem?

128
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Mr. Li, do I need to call the police?

129
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Of course you do.

130
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Why are you so close?

131
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm fine.

132
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
You want money, don't you?

133
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
You want to go?

134
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
General, please punish me.

135
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
If you don't take it now, you'll have no money in the future.

136
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Mr. Li, if you need anything, you can tell the counter.

137
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Do you have it?

138
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
It fellowship.

139
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
It's good.

140
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Get in.

141
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
His seatbelt.

142
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Xiao Yu, I want my bag.

143
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Hello.

144
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Hello.

145
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Yu-Ming.

146
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Hsinchu

147
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
No

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm talking about the one who is a part-time assistant

149
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Hello, Hsinchu

150
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Hello

151
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
No

152
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Your mother-in-law is my benefactor

153
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
She is my cornerstone

154
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
She makes my business reach the top

155
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
You don't talk too much

156
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
I'll go prepare

157
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I've talked about the meat

158
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
The vegetables are not bad

159
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Okay

160
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Let's eat

161
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Is that so?

162
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Chi-ching

163
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Chi-ching

164
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Your mother-in-law is very young

165
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Our child must be very lucky

166
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Hello, child

167
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Yes

168
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Did you go to the toilet?

169
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
What are you doing?

170
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
I'm going to the toilet

171
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I know, I know

172
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I know

173
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Hello

174
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Come on

175
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
We'll go inside after we finish eating

176
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
My mother-in-law is very hard-working

177
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
She is very distracted

178
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,400
She has to take care of her child

179
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
She is almost a mother

180
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
No, Hsinchu

181
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Don't say that

182
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,400
I can't sleep when I'm making the juice

183
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
If I sleep while talking

184
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I'll think of you

185
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
You don't have to bring your wife back

186
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
You can go back to your mother-in-law

187
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
You're 34 years old

188
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
You're about to turn 50

189
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
You have to work all day

190
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
You don't have to worry about your health

191
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
You can come back to the hospital

192
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
I'll treat you

193
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Auntie

194
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
You're going to tell me?

195
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Yes, I'm going to tell you

196
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm telling you

197
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Dr. Zhang has been working so hard

198
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Let's talk about it

199
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Okay

200
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm telling you

201
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm very open-minded

202
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,400
You can get married

203
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
But you have to wait for me

204
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
I'll talk to your father

205
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Okay, if you want to get married

206
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I'll tell you first

207
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Be open-minded

208
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
We have a long story to tell

209
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,400
We have a lot of things to talk about

210
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Be open-minded

211
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
If we have any problems

212
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
We'll tell you first

213
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
This photo is taken from the entrance

214
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
The appearance of Jianfeng Airport

215
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
This photo is their base

216
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
They used traditional old-fashioned machines

217
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
This is the waste they deal with

218
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
in the outdoor area

219
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
We think it's the source of the plague

220
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
My client asked for a simple solution

221
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
He hopes that the smell can be improved

222
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
We only propose a symbolic piece

223
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
of the compensation for the loss of private property

224
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Because we don't want money

225
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
We just want a living environment

226
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
that is full of the smell of waste

227
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
24 hours a day

228
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
We have been reviewing the Ministry of Environment many times

229
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
It's useless

230
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
We don't care about the fine

231
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,400
We just hope that the situation can be improved

232
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
They are just a bunch of idiots

233
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
They even make a noise

234
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
They are all people in the local government

235
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
They are all useless

236
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
The general public doesn't follow this idea

237
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Excuse me, may I finish my words?

238
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,400
They gave me a chance to make a fortune

239
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Why didn't you listen to me?

240
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
You didn't tell me about the five-star restaurant

241
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
It's very troublesome to deal with the fortune

242
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
And there are so many things to do

243
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
How can you give them away?

244
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
No one wants to do it

245
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
How can you be so cruel?

246
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Is it possible to get rid of the five-star restaurant?

247
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
What are you arguing about?

248
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,400
You should talk about your health when you are asleep

249
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Jiaxin, come

250
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Yes, grandpa is still in the hospital

251
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
You don't have to talk about it

252
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
You are always talking about it

253
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Dad, it's the old man

254
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
He thinks we are useless

255
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
He wants to find us

256
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
You are not sensible

257
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
I am not sensible

258
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
He is a man

259
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
He doesn't want to be a man

260
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
He doesn't want to be a man

261
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
You should be a man

262
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Jiaxin

263
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Jiaxin

264
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
What?

265
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Dian Jiaxin

266
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I will run away if you keep talking

267
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
You are a man

268
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
You are so naughty

269
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
What are you doing here?

270
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
You don't know me, do you?

271
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Then you should catch me

272
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
You are talking about this

273
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Fei, Fei

274
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I am your daughter

275
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
I am your daughter

276
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I am your daughter

277
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Let me go

278
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Miss

279
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Let me go

280
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Dad

281
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Dad

282
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
You are...

283
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Dad

284
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Hurry up

285
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Hurry up

286
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Hurry up

287
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
You take him away

288
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Dad, let me go

289
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Jiaxin

290
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Hurry

291
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Come

292
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Dad, come

293
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Hurry

294
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Hurry

295
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Hurry

296
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Hurry

297
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Hurry

298
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Hurry

299
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Hurry

300
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Hurry

301
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Hurry

302
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Hurry

303
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Hurry

304
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Hurry

305
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Hurry

306
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Hurry

307
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Hurry

308
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Hurry

309
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,680
No, it's ok.

310
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
No, it's ok.

311
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,580
P suppose you have confirmed that I have no other ....

312
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,860
Sir!

313
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,420
Sir, why did you suddenly appear here?

314
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,480
Don't you have other business trip?

315
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,500
Based on우

316
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:58,720
I am here just to tell you

317
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,480
I am here just to tell you

318
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,520
the expansion of that site 804

319
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,520
The land in Qing Shan is done.

320
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,520
I'm not worried about this.

321
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,020
I came here to congratulate you on your new job.

322
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,520
Thank you so much.

323
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
You brought me such a big gift on the first day.

324
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,020
This kid is so cute.

325
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,820
You must come to eat with your wife.

326
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,620
This is a hard day. It's a long day.

327
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
Sister.

328
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,820
Sister.

329
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,120
It's time to eat.

330
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,620
What?

331
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,820
You're my daughter.

332
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
I'm afraid that you'll be a little bit tired.

333
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
You're so funny.

334
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
I'm going to sleep.

335
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Enough.

336
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,820
You're so funny.

337
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,820
I'm sorry.

338
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
You're so funny.

339
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
Thank you.

340
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Dear guests and all colleagues.

341
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,820
Hello.

342
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Hello.

343
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
I'm sorry.

344
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
I just met the chairman.

345
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
I have good news for you.

346
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
I just got to know from the scene.

347
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
We have been looking forward to it.

348
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
The location of the expansion of the Qingyun District has been found.

349
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,820
The chairman is up.

350
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
Let's give him a round of applause.

351
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Thank you, everyone.

352
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,820
I love you.

353
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Thank you, the chairman.

354
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
You all made money this year.

355
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,820
Thank you.

356
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
I'm the chairman.

357
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,820
What else do you need?

358
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,820
You tell the director.

359
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Hello.

360
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Hello.

361
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Chairman.

362
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
You're great.

363
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
No one's helping.

364
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
Really.

365
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
I've never seen such a young chairman.

366
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
You're so talented.

367
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Thank you.

368
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
It's all the previous generation who gave me the chance.

369
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,820
You're so modest.

370
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,820
No, thank you.

371
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Thank you.

372
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
The phone is ringing.

373
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
I'm sorry.

374
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
I'll take a call.

375
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
You go ahead.

376
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,820
Hello.

377
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Hello.

378
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Hello.

379
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Hello.

380
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm Chen Ting-yu, a teacher at Guanjun School.

381
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Are you the father of Hu Guanjun?

382
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Yes, I am.

383
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
What's wrong?

384
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Come on.

385
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Come on.

386
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Hello, everyone.

387
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,820
Come on.

388
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,820
Thank you.

389
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Hu Guanjun had a fight with his classmate in the same room.

390
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
He set the house on fire.

391
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820
He didn't listen to any advice.

392
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
He was very upset.

393
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
So he called the police.

394
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
The police took him away.

395
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Hello.

396
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Hello.

397
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Sir.

398
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Where's your wife?

399
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
She's taking medicine and sleeping.

400
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
She can't wake up.

401
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,820
Are you okay, Jia-wei?

402
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,820
You're the president now.

403
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
You're a drunkard.

404
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,820
I'm going to the bathroom.

405
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,820
Okay.

406
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Chairman.

407
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Don't come to me when you're drunk.

408
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
Someone will help you to get rid of the bad habit.

409
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
It's not you.

410
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
You're drunk.

411
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
You're a good man.

412
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
You're drunk.

413
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I'll give you a drink.

414
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Let's drink.

415
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Okay.

416
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Come on.

417
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Thank you.

418
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Thank you.

419
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
Thank you.

420
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
You're amazing.

421
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
You're a good man.

422
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,820
Thank you.

423
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Thank you.

424
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
Mr. Lin.

425
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Are you okay?

426
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Why are you here again?

427
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Do I need to call a cab for you?

428
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Here.

429
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
I'll help you up.

430
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Be careful.

431
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
I'm not going to help you.

432
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,820
Be careful.

433
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
I'm going to help you up.

434
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
I'm going to help you up.

435
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
I'm going to help you up.

436
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,820
I'm going to help you up.

437
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I'm going to help you up.

438
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,820
I'm going to help you up.

439
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
What are you doing here?

440
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,820
Are you going to the library?

441
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
You don't have anything to do?

442
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,820
What are you talking about?

443
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
I was working.

444
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,820
I saw you.

445
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
What are you talking about?

446
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
I saw you.

447
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
You're a coward.

448
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
You're a coward.

449
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Don't drive.

450
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Don't drive.

451
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
Go away.

452
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Let me go.

453
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Let me go.

454
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Let me go.

455
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Let me go.

456
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Let me go.

457
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,820
Let me go.

458
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
Are you the doctor in charge of the night shift?

459
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
I'm Hu Guanjun's youth investigator.

460
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,820
Is it convenient to see him now?

461
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Do you have a certificate?

462
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
I'm going to the library.

463
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
To be honest,

464
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
I've never met a girl who worked so hard

465
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
and came to investigate the museum.

466
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,820
So you saw him now?

467
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Do you have any other proof?

468
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Do you have a parent's consent letter?

469
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Or can you prove

470
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
that he really is your ex-girlfriend?

471
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
Are you looking for a tea?

472
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,820
When can I see him?

473
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,820
I'm a little emotional.

474
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,820
I'm going to call the police.

475
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,820
You won't cause trouble.

476
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Wait a minute.

477
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Hu Guanjun.

478
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Are you Guanjun's father?

479
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm his youth investigator.

480
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Guanjun's father.

481
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Because I have some basic procedures to go through.

482
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I hope I can visit your house as soon as possible.

483
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
At least when you and your wife are here.

484
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
I'm not in Taiwan this week.

485
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
You can talk to my wife.

486
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
At least both parents are here.

487
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Because I discussed with the judge first.

488
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
I hope I can help Guanjun

489
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
to make a statement of his condition.

490
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Because of this,

491
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
I will discuss with your wife

492
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,820
about the government's responsibility.

493
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
Don't waste the government's responsibility on him.

494
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
I'm sorry today.

495
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
I'm Guanjun.

496
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
I'll do whatever I can.

497
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I don't mind.

498
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,820
I'm sorry.

499
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
What did Guanjun do?

500
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
He was arrested for stealing comics.

501
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Then his parents are not willing to reconcile with the store.

502
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
So the case was passed to me.

503
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
I just called the school today.

504
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
The school said he had a fight with his classmates.

505
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
He was emotionally unstable and was burning books in the dormitory.

506
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
So the school and the police sent him here.

507
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
He's really emotional.

508
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
He was still using three or four people in the building.

509
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
To make the EI.

510
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
He even bit my hand.

511
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
But if a person is so disgusted by his father,

512
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
it's hard to stabilize.

513
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
You don't know what's going on in their family.

514
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,820
What have their parents experienced?

515
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Don't just make a random statement, okay?

516
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
This looks like a rich man.

517
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
So what if I'm rich?

518
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
How much money do I have?

519
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
My definition of being rich is

520
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
not to raise children with the ability

521
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
to raise children or to pay money.

522
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Why did you come back?

523
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
Don't you know?

524
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,820
I just came.

525
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
I just asked you to tell me that you're going to the dormitory.

526
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
You said you were going to the dormitory.

527
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,820
What about the money?

528
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
If you have the money, I don't know what to do.

529
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
What are you doing here?

530
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
You're a good person.

531
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
You're a good person.

532
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
You think I'm useless?

533
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,820
Lu Zhi Qiang, why did you come back?

534
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,820
Why did you take my child to the dormitory?

535
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,820
I just wanted to tell you that someone asked you to come back.

536
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
I'm being selfish because you're my daughter.

537
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
You're always being selfish.

538
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
You're just like me.

539
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
You're always trying to get along with me.

540
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
You're trying to get rid of me.

541
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
You think you're a good person?

542
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
You're a bad person!

543
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
Why did you come back?

544
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
You just told me to come back.

545
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
Why did you take my child?

546
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,820
Lu Zhi Qiang, why did you take my child?

547
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
I'm sorry.

548
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I'm sorry.

549
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
I'm sorry.

550
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
I'm sorry.

551
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
I'm sorry.

552
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
I'm sorry.

553
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
I'm sorry.

554
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,820
I'm sorry.

555
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
I'm sorry.

556
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
I'm sorry.

557
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
I'm sorry.

558
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
I'm sorry.

559
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
I'm sorry.

560
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
I'm sorry.

561
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
I'm sorry.

562
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
I'm sorry.

563
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
I'm sorry.

564
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
I'm sorry.

565
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,820
I'm sorry.

566
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
I'm sorry.

567
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
No.

568
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
No.

569
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,820
I'm sorry, kids.

570
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
No.

571
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,820
I'm sorry.

572
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
No.

573
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,820
stronger.

574
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,820
B帷

575
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,780
What are you saying?

576
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
異幻高楼

577
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,820
Coffee

578
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,980
Grandpa, where are you?

579
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,780
I'm too tired

580
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,220
Look at you

581
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,000
Are you curious, okay?

582
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,760
Aren't we both at my best right now?

583
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,420
Come. I'll be fast.

584
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,580
It's the pilot feelingPNS are waiting behind you.

585
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,080
Come in, Associationour.

586
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,580
Come on, little girl. I'm just warning you.

587
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,320
If you want to be like Lu Xiaoxiao,

588
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,920
you'd better not be a man tomorrow.

589
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,320
I'm not Lu Xiaoxiao.

590
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
You...

591
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,820
I'll tell you.

592
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,720
Brother Xiang.

593
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,520
Yes.

594
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,020
It's you.

595
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,220
Miss Han.

596
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,820
You haven't paid the money yet.

597
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,680
I'm not in the mood.

598
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,620
Everyone says you're not in the mood.

599
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,820
Do you know how long I've been in the car?

600
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm not going back today.

601
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,680
Are you going home?

602
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,680
I don't have a home.

603
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,080
Lin Xia!

604
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,480
Jiang Ou.

605
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,580
What's wrong with you?

606
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,280
You're always so serious.

607
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,480
You're not going to tell me?

608
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,080
This way.

609
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,780
You're always so serious.

610
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,780
I don't have a home.

611
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,980
You're in trouble.

612
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
Don't be like this.

613
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,180
Be careful.

614
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,680
Come on, sit down.

615
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,780
Don't be like this, okay?

616
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,180
I know you're in the car.

617
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,480
Brother Hong.

618
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,080
You're not lying to me.

619
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,940
What are you thinking about?

620
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,380
Only...

621
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,980
Listen to me.

622
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,980
If your heart is really hard,

623
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,080
you can hang on.

624
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,780
It will get better.

625
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,880
How can I hang on?

626
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,280
We should be able to rely on each other longer.

627
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,280
You're always drinking and playing around.

628
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,280
You don't have friends or family.

629
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
It's okay.

630
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I'm here.

631
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Yes.

632
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Try another way.

633
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
I'll be with you.

634
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm here.

635
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,280
I'm here.

636
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Mom.

637
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Mom.

638
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
You're back?

639
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
You went to sleep again?

640
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
I cooked for you.

641
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
I'll cook for you.

642
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Don't worry.

643
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
You'll get fat.

644
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Mom.

645
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,280
I know I'm not really trying to scare you.

646
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
I'm sorry.

647
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
I'm late.

648
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,280
You won't get fat if you're too stingy.

649
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
I'm sorry.

650
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,280
I used to be a cook.

651
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,280
I was a good student when I was in school.

652
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,280
But now I'm working as a cook.

653
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,280
I'm not doing well.

654
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,280
You don't have to celebrate with your family.

655
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,280
You can take care of the kids.

656
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,280
You'll have a grandson soon.

657
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,280
You're so sweet.

658
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,280
I've been saving money for my mom.

659
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,280
But I can't get anything back.

660
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
I have to take care of the kids.

661
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Why are you so sweet?

662
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,280
I'm not like other kids.

663
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
If you want to be a good person,

664
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,280
you should go back to your parents' house.

665
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,280
I'm really too old to get married.

666
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Even if you get married,

667
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,280
you can't be a good person.

668
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Even if you get married,

669
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,280
I'll still treat you like my own daughter.

670
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,280
I hope you don't have to worry about me.

671
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,280
I'm fine.

672
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I'm fine.

673
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
The goal of the Zhongming Tang family

674
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
is to help the patients

675
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,280
who are suffering from post-traumatic stress.

676
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,280
After a period of treatment,

677
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,280
the patients are in a stable condition.

678
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,280
They can be discharged from the hospital.

679
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
I'll do it.

680
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,280
I hope you don't have to

681
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,280
connect with the society.

682
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,280
You can't go home for some reason.

683
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,280
I hope you can understand.

684
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,280
I'm sorry.

685
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm sorry.

686
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
You can't stay here.

687
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,280
You can't stay here.

688
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,280
The doctors and the doctors are here.

689
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
If you want to stay,

690
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
it's very hard.

691
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
This is our land.

692
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,280
We only have 60 floors.

693
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm sorry.

694
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Our green area is all

695
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
the city and the countryside.

696
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,280
It's very dirty.

697
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,280
It's not good for your friends.

698
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Friends are preparing to

699
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
connect with the society.

700
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
They should be the same.

701
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Yes, they should be.

702
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
They are all the same.

703
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,280
But I have a question.

704
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
You can help me.

705
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,280
If the government doesn't do something,

706
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
you can't tell me.

707
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
If they don't do something,

708
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
I'll be the judge.

709
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
If they don't...

710
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
I'll be the judge.

711
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
I'll be the judge.

712
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,280
You can't do anything.

713
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Be quiet.

714
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
I'm sorry.

715
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
You're really going to do something?

716
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Yes.

717
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Are you really going to do something?

718
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
Yes.

719
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
You can't stay here.

720
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,280
How about the meeting?

721
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
You can stay here.

722
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
You can't stay here.

723
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
I'm afraid to die.

724
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
I can ask the governor.

725
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
You can't do anything.

726
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
He's just a friend.

727
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
He's just a friend.

728
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
We can't let him

729
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
come back.

730
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
What do you want me to do?

731
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
I saw you

732
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
talking about this.

733
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
This is a public place.

734
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Why don't you let people hear it?

735
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
I'm the judge.

736
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,280
I want to hear it.

737
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
I'm serious.

738
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,280
We should let people hear it.

739
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Yes.

740
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,280
Yihuan.

741
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,280
The residents need

742
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,280
to be open and

743
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,280
social and

744
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
friendly.

745
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
We're sorry.

746
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,280
We're sorry.

747
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
We're sorry.

748
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
We're sorry.

749
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
We're sorry.

750
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
We're sorry.

751
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
We're sorry.

752
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
We're sorry.

753
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Thank you.

754
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Wait.

755
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
Yihuan.

756
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
You're here.

757
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
I didn't know.

758
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
You're in the worst situation.

759
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Auntie, I saw you.

760
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,280
Yes.

761
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
They didn't come back.

762
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
I'm worried about you.

763
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Did you see our son?

764
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
No.

765
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Don't lie to me.

766
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
If he comes back,

767
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
he'll ask for you.

768
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Let's go.

769
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Auntie.

770
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
If you don't understand

771
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
the situation,

772
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
I can show you.

773
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Look at our son.

774
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
He's the same as me.

775
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
You're not working hard

776
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
as a doctor?

777
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
That's bad.

778
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
You'll be sick every day.

779
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
I'll get him a medicine.

780
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,280
You're a kid.

781
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,280
I'll go first.

782
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Come with me.

783
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Hurry.

784
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
Let's go.

785
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
What are you afraid of?

786
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
You can't go to the bathroom.

787
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
You can't do anything.

788
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
It's scary to live with them.

789
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
It's so troublesome

790
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
to live in the community.

791
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
You're awesome.

792
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
How dare you say that to them?

793
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
I'm in.

794
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
I'm leaving.

795
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
I'll leave the championship to you.

796
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Bye.

797
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
Bye.

798
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
But it's so serious.

799
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
There are so many people.

800
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Why?

801
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Why can't we

802
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
go to the east?

803
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Is it a shortcut?

804
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Of course not.

805
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,280
It's not a shortcut.

806
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,280
If you want to

807
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,280
transport the money,

808
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
you need to find equipment,

809
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
and they can't

810
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
take it.

811
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
But it's so serious.

812
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
It's so dirty and messy.

813
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
The center of the house is so dirty.

814
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
It's not a good idea.

815
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I thought you were right.

816
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
As an outsider,

817
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
I think

818
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
I can change 100 percent.

819
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
I can change 90 percent.

820
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
But

821
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
when you get into the system,

822
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
you'll find that you can change 3 percent.

823
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
I think you should

824
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,280
keep going.

825
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Your teacher told you

826
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
it's too easy

827
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
to ban money.

828
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
You need to have a good reason

829
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
to transform.

830
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
So money is the reason.

831
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
The point is education.

832
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
We can change their knowledge

833
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
by education.

834
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I agree with you.

835
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
We need to do

836
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
education and change of knowledge.

837
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
So we need time.

838
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
Good morning, sir.

839
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
The door is here.

840
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
They are waiting for you.

841
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Zhengguang.

842
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
I didn't expect

843
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
you to care about the environment

844
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
after leaving for so long.

845
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,280
You are in your thirties.

846
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
What do you want to do in the future?

847
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Will you be a lawyer forever?

848
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
I...

849
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
I think it's not bad.

850
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
I don't have anyone to help me.

851
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
I need your help.

852
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
I know you are a good talent.

853
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
I advise you

854
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,280
not to waste time

855
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
on the anti-epidemic.

856
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
If you are interested,

857
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
you can contact me anytime.

858
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
Your mom is a typical political figure.

859
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
I think you are a good person.

860
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Tell me when you are ready.

861
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
Good morning.

862
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
I know you are in your thirties.

863
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Your mom is having a hard time.

864
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
If she dies,

865
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,280
nobody knows.

866
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
You will know

867
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
what is the reason.

868
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
Thanks.

869
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Excuse me.

870
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Have you seen my uncle recently?

871
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
He is busy.

872
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
He hasn't seen him for so long.

873
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Is he all right?

874
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
I'm sorry.

875
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
I haven't seen him for long.

876
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Thank you.

877
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm sorry.

878
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Have you seen my uncle recently?

879
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,320
No way!

880
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,140
I've met sometimes

881
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,580
I don't know why

882
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,520
Chua Yung Ming gave out this letter

883
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,480
or to her

884
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,760
I screened it

885
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,160
and tried my best

886
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,560
I've spent so much time

887
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,260
to work for her

888
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Okay.

889
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
Listen.

890
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Your grandma has been missing for many days.

891
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
How can I find her?

892
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
If you see her in the street,

893
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
you must be able to find her.

894
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
She's missing?

895
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Why?

896
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Is she not home?

897
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
I suspect she's the same as Chuan.

898
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
You mean...

899
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
This is Guan Jun's tutoring record.

900
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Guan Jun transferred half of his tuition this semester.

901
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,280
He had a fight with Mr. Guan Jun on the first day.

902
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
He had a fight with English teacher in the afternoon.

903
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,280
He had a fight with his roommate in the dorm.

904
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
What fight?

905
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Mr. Guan Jun was talking on the stage.

906
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
He was reading the text.

907
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
He was just reading the text.

908
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,280
He thought the test was too simple

909
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,280
and wasted his time.

910
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Do you think the text said

911
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,280
Mr. Guan Jun was too easy

912
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
to understand?

913
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
He's a smart kid.

914
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
But we teach him in a more

915
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,280
authoritative way.

916
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
He's not good at it.

917
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
I talked to Guan Jun twice.

918
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
He's very cautious.

919
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
He thinks all teachers

920
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
are like his parents.

921
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
He thinks he's a loser.

922
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Hi, grandma.

923
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
What room is it?

924
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
127.

925
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,280
Thank you.

926
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Hey, Ah-Chan.

927
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,280
You're a godmother again.

928
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
Right?

929
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
You're so sweet.

930
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
You don't look like you just came in.

931
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
With so many godmothers and godfathers,

932
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
you must feel safe.

933
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Can I leave the hospital?

934
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
He finished the test.

935
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
Yes.

936
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Surprised?

937
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Surprised?

938
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Happy?

939
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Very surprised.

940
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Very surprised.

941
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Very happy.

942
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
When can I leave the hospital?

943
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
After I talk to your parents

944
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
and the dispatch officer,

945
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
I'll tell you.

946
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
You didn't ask them

947
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
when I came in.

948
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Why do you ask now?

949
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,280
You're still a kid.

950
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
If you leave the hospital now,

951
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
you might be a dog.

952
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Damn it.

953
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
This is his room.

954
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
It's exactly like his brother's.

955
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,280
We give him whatever he wants.

956
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
My grandma said she adores him.

957
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
My husband said I don't teach kids.

958
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
But Miss Niu,

959
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
I teach both kids.

960
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Why is our brother

961
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
not a problem?

962
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
He's still a national model.

963
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
What about my brother?

964
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
He's a student in London.

965
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
I think

966
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
his education in Taiwan

967
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
is not suitable for him.

968
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
I let him study in the US.

969
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
But it's still the same.

970
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,280
He fights all day.

971
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
He fights with black people and white people.

972
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
Miss Niu.

973
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
I don't need it.

974
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,280
Thank you.

975
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
It's okay.

976
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,280
I hired all the teachers.

977
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
It's the same.

978
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
It's useless.

979
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
He left home all day.

980
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
I just fly away.

981
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
I have to take care of my mother-in-law

982
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
and my brother.

983
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
I have all the ways.

984
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,280
If we continue to stay in the US,

985
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
he will buy guns and drugs.

986
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
But Guan Jun

987
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
is in the US alone.

988
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
He must have suffered a lot.

989
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Suffered?

990
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
Miss Niu.

991
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
He is the devil.

992
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
How can the devil suffer?

993
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
You are so guilty.

994
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Qi Wei.

995
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
How do you feel now?

996
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
We are

997
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,280
the representatives of the high-ranking officials.

998
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
They said you are very smart.

999
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
Nice.

1000
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Qi Wei.

1001
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
When did you start

1002
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
to realize that you can't sleep well?

1003
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
It was probably

1004
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,280
when I was in the first grade of primary school.

1005
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,280
I couldn't sleep well every night.

1006
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
I had nightmares and cried all the time.

1007
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
It was only after I arrived in Singapore.

1008
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Singapore?

1009
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,280
This.

1010
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
Singapore's hospital

1011
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
has taken sleeping pills.

1012
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
It's been a long time.

1013
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Nothing has changed.

1014
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
When did you start to realize

1015
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
that these drugs

1016
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
have some bad effects?

1017
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
But after I returned to Taiwan,

1018
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
it was probably the earliest.

1019
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,280
Suddenly,

1020
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
the panic started to spread.

1021
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
It hasn't been long.

1022
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
Mom.

1023
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Let's go outside.

1024
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Let's go outside.

1025
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
It's important.

1026
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Take a break.

1027
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
I don't want to go.

1028
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
Mom, I'm going to ask you.

1029
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
Do you want to buy me some soup?

1030
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,280
I'll take you to the hospital.

1031
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,280
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1032
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,280
Do you want to tell me

1033
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
what the doctor said later?

1034
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
Okay, I know.

1035
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Come on.

1036
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Take a break.

1037
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm still sleepy.

1038
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,280
I have to eat something heavier.

1039
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
What about you?

1040
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Can't you eat the food they give you?

1041
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
I...

1042
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
I...

1043
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,280
I often have nightmares.

1044
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
What kind of nightmares?

1045
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
I...

1046
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
I often dream about myself.

1047
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280
I run very hard.

1048
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
I don't know what I'm looking for.

1049
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
I don't know what I'm looking for.

1050
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,280
When someone is by my side,

1051
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
I feel annoyed.

1052
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,280
I feel tired living.

1053
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
Am I hard to tell?

1054
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
I hate it.

1055
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,280
You have this feeling.

1056
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,280
It means you are a very delicate person.

1057
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,280
I think it's pretty good.

1058
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,280
In fact, our life is

1059
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,280
to keep exploring

1060
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
what we need.

1061
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,280
It's normal to not know what I need.

1062
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
The point is

1063
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
not to hate yourself.

1064
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Take a look at your prescription.

1065
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
I'll help you make some modifications.

1066
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,280
It's really hard not to hate myself.

1067
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,280
You are so punctual.

1068
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,280
You learned the reason for the car accident?

1069
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
You like to be a bad person?

1070
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,280
So you stole the bad person's manga?

1071
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
It's a radio car.

1072
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,280
The machine said it would get dirty if I couldn't wipe it.

1073
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
The school said

1074
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,280
what were you doing here last time?

1075
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
You did nothing.

1076
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,280
Why did you burn the textbook in the car?

1077
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,280
I went to school to learn the power.

1078
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,280
I have to write everything.

1079
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,280
I have to read books.

1080
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,280
So it's all others' fault?

1081
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,280
It's their fault.

1082
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,280
You let yourself be punished for others' fault.

1083
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Are you punishing them,

1084
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,280
punishing yourself,

1085
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,280
or punishing your parents?

1086
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I did it anyway.

1087
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
Just leave it.

1088
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
In fact, your grades are not bad.

1089
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,280
Do you know?

1090
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
If you work harder,

1091
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,280
you will have a chance to get into a good college or high school.

1092
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
The school doesn't want me.

1093
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,280
So you like a room for 8 people.

1094
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Someone will tell you when to get up and when to eat.

1095
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
Everyone will take a shower to educate you.

1096
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,280
If you make trouble, you will be locked in the casino.

1097
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,280
It's different from now.

1098
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
So you like to stay here?

1099
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,280
Who likes it?

1100
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,280
I can't even eat ice cream.

1101
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,280
I'm so hungry.

1102
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,280
Freedom is also about making efforts.

1103
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,280
I can figure out the school's problem.

1104
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,280
But the premise is that you have to have a will.

1105
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,280
The famous person also wants to graduate.

1106
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,280
The result of the experiment is conduct disorder.

1107
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
Now translated as

1108
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,280
quality anxiety or quality disorder.

1109
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,280
What a bad translation.

1110
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,280
Quality anxiety or quality disorder.

1111
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,280
Who is perfect now?

1112
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,280
I agree.

1113
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,280
Maybe DSN will be able to change its name to a hotel soon.

1114
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,280
In addition, the champion also has ADHD.

1115
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280
Children like this,

1116
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
because of brain development,

1117
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,280
often lack concentration

1118
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
and lack control over behavior.

1119
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
So in class,

1120
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,280
they are often treated as those students who are not obedient and can't control.

1121
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,280
I used to be like that.

1122
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,280
I was miserable when I was a kid.

1123
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,280
Fortunately, the teacher of the National College of the Three Kingdoms

1124
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,280
made me play basketball.

1125
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
I'm at ease.

1126
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,280
You are lucky.

1127
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,280
You can meet the right person at the right time.

1128
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
You can do it too.

1129
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,280
You haven't been home for a few days.

1130
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,280
Your clothes are the same.

1131
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,280
I used to have this tattoo on my body.

1132
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,280
Bullshit.

1133
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,280
Who is it?

1134
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
I know.

1135
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,280
I have an appointment at five and half.

1136
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,280
You will arrive at six and half.

1137
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
You have something to eat?

1138
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,280
Yes, I have something to eat.

1139
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,280
Let's talk while we walk, okay?

1140
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,280
Okay.

1141
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,280
At present,

1142
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,280
I think Hu Guan Jun has a very obvious resistance to violence.

1143
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,280
It should be that the ADHD he had before was not handled well.

1144
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,280
But his school grades are not bad.

1145
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,280
That's right.

1146
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
I think he has a chance to go back to school.

1147
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,280
But his parents don't seem to want him to go home.

1148
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,280
They keep emphasizing that he should do whatever he should do.

1149
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,280
They want to send him to Gansu.

1150
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,280
I think so.

1151
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,280
But our family environment is not bad.

1152
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,280
I just don't have the ability to face a child like him.

1153
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
That ability?

1154
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,280
You don't have the ability or the time?

1155
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,280
His mother was a little anxious before she faced him.

1156
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,280
His father may be very busy at work.

1157
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,280
He doesn't have time to care about him.

1158
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,280
Are you sure he will be better at home?

1159
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,280
He may not be better at the nursing home.

1160
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,280
He may have a higher rate of crime.

1161
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,280
But if he doesn't go to the nursing home,

1162
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,280
first, he needs a good judge.

1163
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,280
Second, he needs me to accept his school and teacher.

1164
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,280
Third, his parents will change.

1165
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,280
It's so hard.

1166
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,280
Okay.

1167
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,280
First, the judge will solve it.

1168
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
Second, the school.

1169
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,280
Do you have a way to solve the school?

1170
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,280
Do you want me to hold a joint meeting and find a way to solve it?

1171
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,280
The school sent people without a right to decide.

1172
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,280
My mother said she would go back to the city to ask for permission.

1173
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,280
But she said she didn't have a son.

1174
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,280
I know that for a child like Guan Jun,

1175
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,280
it takes a lot of effort.

1176
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,280
But...

1177
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,280
Wu Yuanhai or the county mayor should have a chance.

1178
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,280
You go to the forced admission committee.

1179
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,280
Can I?

1180
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,280
I'll let you go.

1181
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,280
Guan Jun is a student.

1182
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,280
And the three parents.

1183
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,280
Do you need to hold a joint meeting first?

1184
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,280
It's okay.

1185
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,280
I'll try.

1186
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,280
I need to talk to you.

1187
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,280
Go.

1188
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,280
I'm leaving.

1189
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,280
Bye.

1190
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,280
Thanks.

1191
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,280
I won't be late next time.

1192
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,280
You're kidding.

1193
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,280
Okay.

1194
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,280
Bye.

1195
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,280
Bye.

1196
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,280
Sir, your food delivery is here.

1197
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,280
You're here.

1198
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
You must be mistaken.

1199
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,280
I'm calling the sex officer.

1200
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
Where is he?

1201
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,280
You really think I'm a chicken?

1202
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,280
Sir, please be patient.

1203
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,280
I got it.

1204
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,280
My mom asked me to move out.

1205
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,280
Why?

1206
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,280
She said I'd be in trouble if I didn't go on a blind date.

1207
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,280
Go ahead.

1208
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
South area.

1209
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,280
I'm going.

1210
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,280
I'm really going.

1211
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,280
East area.

1212
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,280
It's strange.

1213
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,280
Why do everyone think that a judge can't go on a blind date?

1214
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,280
Judges are human.

1215
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,280
They're raised by their parents.

1216
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,280
They want to date.

1217
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,280
They should be able to go on a blind date.

1218
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,280
Okay.

1219
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,280
I'm so tired.

1220
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,280
I'm sorry.

1221
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
I was just...

1222
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,280
I'm sorry.

1223
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,280
As long as you say yes,

1224
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,280
we can go on a blind date anytime.

1225
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,280
It's better to sleep in the middle of the night.

1226
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,280
I can't.

1227
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,280
This is just plain awful.

1228
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:49,280
Do you think anyone can go on a blind date

1229
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,280
kept by the person they're wandering

1230
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
with their²

1231
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,280
bunch of dogs?

1232
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,280
How can you say this?

1233
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,280
Are you okay?

1234
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,280
No.

1235
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,280
Are you okay?

1236
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,280
Why didn't you add a jacket?

1237
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,280
It's cold.

1238
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,280
Have some soup.

1239
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,280
You two should take care of yourselves.

1240
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,280
You two are the only ones who can take care of yourselves.

1241
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,280
You two are the only ones who can take care of yourselves.

1242
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
I'm glad you're happy.

1243
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,280
Don't go out

1244
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,280
No matter who comes.

1245
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,280
Don't make yourself sick.

1246
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,280
Don't make yourself sick.

1247
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,280
If you want to go back, you have to go back.

1248
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,280
If you want to go back, you have to go back.

1249
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,280
Someone said they saw A-Kong.

1250
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,280
Someone said they saw A-Kong.

1251
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,280
Who can go to find him?

1252
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
This is A-Kong?

1253
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,280
This is A-Kong?

1254
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,280
Hello.

1255
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,280
Hello.

1256
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,280
I'm Luo Zhi-Chang's wife.

1257
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
Luo Zhi-Chang?

1258
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,280
Come with me.

1259
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,280
Luo Zhi-Chang's family is here.

1260
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Come here.

1261
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,280
You're...

1262
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,280
What are you doing?

1263
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,280
I'm a man.

1264
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,280
What?

1265
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,280
What did you say?

1266
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,280
You're a man.

1267
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,280
I'm not a man.

1268
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,280
I'm not a man.

1269
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,280
It's none of your business.

1270
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,280
You're looking for me to be a man.

1271
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
Hey!

1272
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,280
I'm a man.

1273
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,280
I'm a man.

1274
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,280
I'm a man.

1275
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,280
I'm a man.

1276
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,280
I'm a man.

1277
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,280
I'm a man.

1278
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,280
I'm a man.

1279
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,280
I'm a man.

1280
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,280
I'm a man.

1281
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,280
I'm a man.

1282
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,280
I'm a man.

1283
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,280
I'm a man.

1284
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280
I'm a man.

1285
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,280
I'm a man.

1286
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
I'm a man.

1287
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,280
I'm a man.

1288
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,280
I'm a man.

1289
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,280
I'm a man.

1290
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,280
I'm a man.

1291
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,280
I'm a man.

1292
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,280
I'm a man.

1293
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,280
I'm a man.

1294
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,280
I'm a man.

1295
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,280
I'm a man.

1296
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,280
I'm a man.

1297
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,280
I'm a man.

1298
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,280
I'm a man.

1299
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,280
I'm a man.

1300
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,280
I'm a man.

1301
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
I'm a man.

1302
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,280
I'm a man.

1303
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,280
I'm a man.

1304
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
I'm a man.

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,280
I'm a man.

1307
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,280
I'm a man.

1308
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,280
I'm a man.

1309
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,280
I'm a man.

1310
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,280
I'm a man.

1311
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
I'm a man.

1312
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,280
I'm a man.

1313
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,280
I'm a man.

1314
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,280
I'm a man.

1315
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,280
I'm a man.

1316
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,280
I'm a man.

1317
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,280
I'm a man.

1318
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,280
I'm a man.

1319
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,280
