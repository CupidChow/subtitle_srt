Episode 1

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A-Shing-Kei,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I haven't been able to show you this for a few days.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If I don't show you enough,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'll be sorry, A-Shing-Kei.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A-Shing-Kei, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's not the same!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're a fool!

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A-Shing-Kei!

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A-Shing-Kei!

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A-Shing-Kei!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What are you doing?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What are you doing?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
A-Shing-Kei, don't go!

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A-Shing-Kei, don't go!

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to kill you!

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What are you doing?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Luo Yue, you go back!

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Go back!

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm done!

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Don't you dare to shoot me!

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You're going to die!

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A-Shing-Kei!

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A-Shing-Kei, A-Shing-Kei!

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A-Shing-Kei!

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't mess with me, A-Shing-Kei!

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, the live broadcast continues to bring you attention.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It happened in the last year,

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the law enforcement and suicide app in Qingyun County.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And we are currently in the place

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
where the victim is the local resident of the Liu Jingbo, the law enforcement and suicide app.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The father of the Liu Jingbo, the law enforcement and suicide app,

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
was originally the leader of the Qingyun County Public Prosecutor's Office.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He has moved to the original place and is now in the same place.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
According to the information, the victim is sentenced to death by a trial.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The case is still on the court.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The law enforcement and suicide app in Liu Jingbo, the law enforcement and suicide app,

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
is a crime against the law enforcement and suicide app.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The prosecutor's office said that the witness

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
was not satisfied with the report of the crime.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We are a team.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There are psychological, social, and mental health agencies.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There are also the assistant doctors and nurses.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We are in the process of observing and writing the report.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then we discuss the case.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I went to the dormitory to complete the report of the witness.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I was in the process of writing the report.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was in the process of writing the report.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And the court is sentenced to death.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's not that there is no treatment.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There are still five years of trial and error.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't understand what the prosecutor said.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And the witness is a professional.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's not that he is looking forward to the welfare of society.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Shouldn't he be a professional?

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Increasing the pressure on the prosecutor's office is definitely not the way

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to reduce the mental illness and change the way of the criminal.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We should consider how to make them

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
maintain their mental health and provide enough social support.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If we really think that one person is guilty,

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
we should think that one person is guilty.

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We should think that one person is guilty.

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Detương B Effect

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,920
I am turning on the cam Gergin

77
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,420
Literally AWOL!

78
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,460
No wonder it's 2 previously.

79
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,060
Now behave yourself instead.

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,100
See where you are!

81
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,120
No network connection.

82
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,340
Now a little bit like a snake.

83
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,740
Where is the phone?

84
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,340
It's here!

85
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,140
Where is the phone?

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,140
It's here!

87
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,340
Where is the phone?

88
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,340
Where is the phone?

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,340
What are you doing?

90
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
You don't even have to do your homework.

91
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,340
I'll take your phone to the internet.

92
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,540
I took your phone to give you a lesson.

93
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,340
It's not something that's not nutritious.

94
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,740
I'm looking for a job.

95
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,740
He's looking for a job.

96
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,940
Are you going to die?

97
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,540
Let go of your hand.

98
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,140
Can I?

99
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,540
You can.

100
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,540
You used to care about your dad.

101
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,940
You care about Xie Yang and Hai Liao Liao.

102
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,140
You finally married your dad.

103
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,540
You didn't even give birth to him.

104
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,740
We were born to be a doctor.

105
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,140
We went to see a doctor.

106
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,140
What are you talking about?

107
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,940
This family doesn't care about you, right?

108
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,740
You're not supposed to mess around every day.

109
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,140
I'm not!

110
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,740
I'm not going to be killed if I mess around.

111
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,740
Xiaohui!

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,740
What time is it?

113
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,740
What's wrong?

114
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
What's wrong?

115
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,740
What's wrong?

116
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,740
Xiaohui!

117
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,740
What's wrong?

118
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,740
Xiaohui!

119
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
What's wrong?

120
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,740
Do you know that we're dead?

121
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,740
We were the ones who did it.

122
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
3 brothers

123
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,340
I finally found a dead man.

124
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,340
You wanted to find him.

125
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,340
You can tell me what just happened.

126
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,340
We're going to found a girlfriend.

127
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,740
So you won't put that call to us?

128
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,140
I'll give you your last name.

129
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,140
I don't have enough钱.

130
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,140
You can go to the next room.

131
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,140
Do you know where we are going?

132
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
We are going to the Kending.

133
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,140
Kending.

134
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,140
I don't want to go to the Kending.

135
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Why?

136
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,140
He doesn't want to go to the Kending.

137
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,140
He is going to the outer space to play the foreign game.

138
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,140
Right?

139
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Yes.

140
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,140
Can you play the game?

141
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,140
No.

142
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,140
It's okay.

143
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,140
Dad will bring us the big yellow wind.

144
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,140
Okay.

145
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
Okay.

146
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,140
Come on.

147
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,140
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

148
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
3, 2, 1.

149
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,140
I'll play one.

150
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,140
Teacher knows our family situation.

151
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,140
What should I do?

152
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Then you can write your wish to be a family trip.

153
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,140
Then I want to go to the Kending.

154
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,140
I'll write it.

155
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,140
I'll write it.

156
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,140
Okay.

157
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
I'll write it.

158
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,140
Okay.

159
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
I'll write it.

160
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,140
Mom.

161
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,140
What are you doing?

162
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,140
Get up.

163
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,140
Get up.

164
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
Get up.

165
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,140
Get up.

166
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,140
Okay.

167
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,140
Go.

168
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,140
I thought it was a good idea.

170
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,140
I thought I should bring the key back to the bathroom.

171
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,140
I'll bring it here when I need it.

172
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
So that we can have a good rest at night.

173
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,140
I'm so tired.

174
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,140
I'll go get some tea.

175
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,140
Let's go.

176
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Let's go.

177
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,140
Let's go.

178
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,140
How long do you want to stay here?

179
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,140
Do you think I have the right to be a doctor?

180
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,140
I...

181
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,140
can still work with my conscience?

182
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,140
I just want to give you some more time.

183
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,140
No one knows what will happen in two months.

184
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,140
We thought we could take care of everyone.

185
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,140
But we couldn't do anything.

186
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,140
The doctor is not a god.

187
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,140
Even if it's a god, it will make tragedy happen.

188
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,140
Although we don't know why...

189
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,140
I want to ask you about the ability to take care of the patient.

190
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,140
And the right to be a doctor.

191
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,140
I... I'll leave.

192
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
You should rest for a while.

193
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,140
You don't need to be so courteous.

194
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,140
You know I'm on my phone for 24 hours.

195
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,140
You're not going to leave today?

197
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,140
I've hidden the car key.

198
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,140
Is this enough?

199
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,140
No.

200
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,140
Two minutes.

201
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,140
Don't go out today.

202
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,140
Xinzhu will come to see you.

203
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,100
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
Mom,

205
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,340
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,340
You either sleep,

207
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,740
or get up and eat.

208
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,940
Don't say these five or three.

209
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,740
Go to school.

210
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,140
Mom, don't go out today.

211
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,340
Take a good rest at home.

212
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,540
You're not going to school?

213
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,540
I'm at home studying.

214
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
Remember to wear a mask and wash your hands.

215
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,740
I'll bully you and tell me.

216
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,540
Okay.

217
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,140
Why are you arguing with mom?

218
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
She's sick.

219
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,700
Mom.

220
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,340
Mom,

221
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,140
I'm so fry.

222
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,900
You know there's nothing long永レ square.

223
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,540
My mom will say that

224
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,780
if she gifts you a good meal,...

225
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,780
You should go to class.

226
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,780
I'm fine.

227
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Why are you so handsome?

228
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,780
You're the best kid in the world.

229
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,780
That's right.

230
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,780
I don't regret leaving you guys.

231
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,780
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,780
You must study hard.

233
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,780
And get into a good school.

234
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
Then you'll have hope in the future.

235
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,780
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,780
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
What's wrong?

238
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,780
I'm not sure.

239
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,780
I'm not sure.

240
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,780
I can come to work in the next few days.

241
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Is it because of the police or the division?

242
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,780
I'll come to pick you up one day.

243
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
You're 16 years old.

244
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
You'll be in trouble.

245
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
Go back.

246
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,780
Hey.

249
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,780
You haven't taken money to go home, have you?

250
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
Come here.

251
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

252
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,780
I'll pay you back first.

253
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
You're so small.

254
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,780
Go to class.

255
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Okay.

256
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
I'll go to class.

257
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,780
I'll go to class.

258
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
Okay.

259
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,780
I'll go to class.

260
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,780
Okay.

261
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,780
Thank you.

262
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,780
Okay.

263
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,780
I'll go to class.

264
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,780
What's your name?

265
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
I'm looking for Hu Guanjun.

266
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,780
Hello.

267
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,780
The relationship between you and Hu Guanjun is...

268
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
We're husband and wife.

269
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
My name is Li Ziqin.

270
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
Li Ziqin?

271
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,780
You're his girlfriend before?

272
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,780
Didn't you break up?

273
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,780
I was.

274
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,780
But he can't have me.

275
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,780
Every time he breaks up, he'll be in trouble.

276
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,780
Can I let him see his father?

277
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,780
You have no idea.

278
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,780
Have you ever written?

279
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,780
I've written many times.

280
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,780
I don't think I can write.

281
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,780
I'll write the answer if I don't do it.

282
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,780
I've promised you.

283
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,780
I've already given you the face.

284
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,780
Recording.

285
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,780
They're doing it.

286
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Don't be so mean.

287
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,780
You're the one who's filial.

288
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,780
You know that Niu Youhe...

289
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,780
died in the supermarket with his son?

290
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,780
You know that Dr. Ma...

291
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
died because of you?

292
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,780
You know that the world's only...

293
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
one person who trusted your young security guard...

294
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Niu Youhe and his son...

295
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,780
are you burnt to death?

296
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,780
I'm not.

297
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,780
You're Niu Youhe and his son...

298
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,780
are you burnt to death?

299
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Dr. Ma is like a living dead every day.

300
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,780
His mother is now bullying you.

301
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,780
You think those dead people...

302
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,780
have nothing to do with you, right?

303
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,780
They're dead.

304
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,780
You're burnt to death.

305
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,780
You're like a living dead every day.

306
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,780
You're burnt to death.

307
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,780
You're burnt to death.

308
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,780
Calm down, okay?

309
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,780
What happened?

310
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,780
I'll apologize to you.

311
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
I apologize to the director...

312
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,780
for my miscarriage.

313
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,780
I'm sorry, but I...

314
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,780
I really can't do it.

315
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,780
Mr. Wu, what do you need?

316
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
I want to see Dr. Ma.

317
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
Why are you here?

318
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,780
I'm here.

319
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780
You're here.

320
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
Do you want to see him?

321
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780
You're here.

322
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,780
Calm down.

323
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
$250.

324
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,780
Okay.

325
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,780
Thank you.

326
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
Bye.

327
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,780
Is this Qiao You Bang?

328
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,780
No.

329
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
The police have reported that...

330
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
Gao Zhen's court has decided to cancel the case.

331
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,780
I don't understand.

332
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
What do you mean?

333
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,780
Anyway, Wu Qian is still watching the lawsuit.

334
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,780
So she won't come out for now.

335
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
Don't think too much.

336
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,780
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
I'm sorry.

339
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
I'm sorry.

340
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,780
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,780
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,780
I apologize for my behavior.

344
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,780
I know this is not easy for you.

345
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,780
But please believe me.

346
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
I'll prove each person's right and positive.

347
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,780
The most important thing now...

348
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,780
is to stay connected.

349
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,780
Therefore, there's no need to out the charges.

350
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,760
Speaking

351
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,140

352
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,140

355
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,560
our no the child that is allowed to be your parents

356
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Don't blame your dad. He loves you very much.

357
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
He's sick.

358
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,560
Please, Auntie, I'll find a good person for you.

359
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Don't say that again.

360
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,560
But the new family has forgotten us.

361
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Remember, you're the best kid in the world.

362
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,560
This kid is enough.

363
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,560
Baochu

364
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Cons Judaism

365
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Are you still having our photos?

366
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
Why isn't there Mom's photos?

367
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,560
She's helping us! And she's not around herself.

368
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,440
Do you even have a memories of her photos?

369
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:24,680
Why?

370
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,800
How is it? Have you found anyone?

371
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,480
It's done!

372
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,840
You just don't have to talk about it.

373
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,480
Is Mum in contact with other friends?

374
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,640
No, she hasn't.

375
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,880
After finding the camera,

376
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:52,580
she needs your help by

377
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,080
I gotta go.

378
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,640
No.

379
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Wait a minute.

380
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,360
Your mom is Gao Zhenming.

381
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,320
No.

382
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,360
My mom is Chen Youming.

383
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,720
Because I'm the one who...

384
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,000
Do you have a secret account?

385
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,680
I haven't changed my name.

386
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,200
I'll start from your residence.

387
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,560
You don't have to wait here.

388
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,920
If I find someone, I'll tell you.

389
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,840
Okay, thank you.

390
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,800
Please.

391
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,440
How is it now?

392
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,480
They'll drop the notice

393
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,840
if they find someone else.

394
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,240
I'll call you when I find someone else.

395
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,800
Okay.

396
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,560
Thank you.

397
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,400
Please.

398
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,520
You still haven't answered the phone?

399
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,400
You're not going to pick me up?

400
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,040
Xin Tuget,

401
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,320
I'll tell you when I find his aunt.

402
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,640
Okay, thank you.

403
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,160
Who's looking for you?

404
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,720
Nothing.

405
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,880
Sorry for taking so long.

406
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,280
Where's my car?

407
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,320
I'll go back myself.

408
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,400
Luo Yu,

409
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,280
call me when you get home.

410
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,400
Chuan Wan,

411
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
my brother arrival from Fung Ah Noodle Hotel

412
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,920
and knocked down some Manager Kim

413
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,920
in order to fix Christian Dou'slar case.

414
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,480
How about

415
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,360
when he,

416
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,160
Chrissie,

417
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
I'm not sure what to say.

418
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
I'm not sure what to say.

419
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
You are the best.

420
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Welcome to the temple.

421
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
I'm not sure.

422
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
We have given it to us.

423
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
We don't have a temple.

424
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
It's not appropriate.

425
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
I understand.

426
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
I don't know what to say.

427
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Look,

428
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
I care about the temple.

429
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
It's good.

430
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
I'm telling you,

431
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
if you don't want to go to the temple,

432
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
you should go to the temple.

433
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
If you want to go,

434
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
you can go to the temple.

435
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
I'm a little sleepy.

436
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
If you don't have a chance,

437
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
you can go to the temple.

438
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
Right?

439
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Excuse me.

440
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
You can go to the hospital.

441
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
I have something to do.

442
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
I'll go to the temple.

443
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Here.

444
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
What?

445
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Why are you so sleepy?

446
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
What do you mean?

447
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,160
I'm just a little sleepy.

448
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
I see.

449
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
People are always asking questions.

450
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
They ask questions.

451
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Right.

452
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
The best thing is to support the temple.

453
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,160
The best thing is to take care of the people.

454
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
The best thing is to take care of the people.

455
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
For example,

456
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
the food and the temple.

457
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
If you don't go to the temple,

458
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
you'll be in trouble.

459
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
What are you doing?

460
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
I'm here.

461
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
I'll bring you a bottle of water.

462
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Please.

463
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
You can't talk about the temple.

464
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
You're so generous.

465
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
You're so generous.

466
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
You're so generous.

467
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
I'm not like a baby.

468
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
I'm just a little sleepy.

469
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Ms. Lin.

470
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Here's something important.

471
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
What?

472
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
You're going to the hospital?

473
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Yes.

474
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Get in the car.

475
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Here.

476
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
Let's go.

477
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Come on.

478
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
What?

479
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
What's wrong?

480
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
You go home. I'll go.

481
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
He's not picking up the phone.

482
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
He's not picking up the phone.

483
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
He's not picking up the phone.

484
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
He's not picking up the phone.

485
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
You know what?

486
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
The owner's contact number is always the same.

487
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
If you don't go to the temple,

488
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
you'll be in trouble.

489
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
He'll be in trouble.

490
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
He'll be in trouble.

491
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Come on.

492
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
I'll take you home.

493
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I'll go.

494
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
He's here.

495
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I'll go with you.

496
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
I'll take the phone.

497
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
You can go to the temple now.

498
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
I'll go.

499
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm here.

500
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
No one?

501
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
No.

502
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I'll take you home.

503
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
I'll go.

504
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Hello.

505
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Hello.

506
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
What time is it?

507
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
I have a ticket to the temple.

508
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
You can go to the temple.

509
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
I'll go to the temple.

510
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I'll go to the temple.

511
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
You're so mean.

512
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
You're so mean.

513
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
You're a good boy.

514
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
I'm not a good boy.

515
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
It's your birthday.

516
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Who's birthday?

517
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm going to tell you.

518
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
I'll ask you for a gift for dinner.

519
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
It's okay.

520
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
I'll go and buy it.

521
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
No need.

522
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
You're so nice.

523
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
I'm sorry.

524
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
You're so nice.

525
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
I'll go.

526
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
I'll go.

527
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
I'll go.

528
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
I'll go.

529
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
I'll go.

530
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
I'll go.

531
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
I'll go.

532
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
I'll go.

533
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
This is for you.

534
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
I'll buy you this.

535
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Okay?

536
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
This is for you.

537
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
He knows I'm going to introduce my boyfriend.

538
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
He doesn't know.

539
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
This is for you.

540
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
I'll show you when I have the chance.

541
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I'll be back after work.

542
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Uncle, you're not going to tell me?

543
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Yes.

544
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
People are always happy.

545
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,160
They don't want to introduce their loved ones.

546
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Uncle, you're so nice.

547
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
My love is a good boy.

548
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
He's a good guy.

549
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Come here.

550
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Come here.

551
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
He's so nice.

552
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
He's a good guy.

553
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
You're so nice.

554
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
You're doing an exhibition.

555
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
This is a good guy.

556
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
He likes you.

557
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Now you're a good girl.

558
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
You're so nice.

559
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
I'm not.

560
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I'm a good guy.

561
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
You're so nice.

562
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
I don't know how to talk.

563
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I'm going to go to the hospital.

564
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I'll take care of my baby.

565
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
I'll go.

566
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Uncle, come here.

567
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Come here.

568
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Uncle, come here.

569
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Come here.

570
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Uncle,

571
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
I'm going to go to the hospital.

572
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,160
I want to see my husband.

573
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Uncle,

574
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
I'll take you to the hospital.

575
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
I'll go to the hospital.

576
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Uncle, you're so nice.

577
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
We're going to start.

578
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Let's do it.

579
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Let's do it.

580
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
There's plenty of fresh food.

581
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Fresh beef.

582
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Now we're going to make a barbecue.

583
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
The weather is so hot.

584
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,160
You're so smart.

585
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,320
during pregnancy, exposed to swallow

586
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,160
want to take a nap

587
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
Back and forth

588
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Like this

589
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
just wait

590
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,600

592
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
every few days

593
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
go down gradually

594
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
will make you quickly

595
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,660
and Congress

596
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,160
that's a must

597
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
I'm sorry.

598
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
I don't have any time to do the investigation.

599
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I'll be right back.

600
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Okay.

601
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Have a good day.

602
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I'll send you a message.

603
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
There's a note.

604
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
The Holy Spirit is in love with the people in the temple.

605
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
It's not going to work.

606
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
You're going to see it.

607
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Here it comes.

608
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Come, sit down.

609
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Sit down.

610
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
Here it comes.

611
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Come, sit down.

612
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
What?

613
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
I'm busy.

614
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Excuse me.

615
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Do you have a new job?

616
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Yes.

617
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm a regular here.

618
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
I'm going to work in the temple.

619
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Excuse me.

620
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Excuse me.

621
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
I'll send you a message.

622
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Okay.

623
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
I'll send you a message.

624
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Okay.

625
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Excuse me.

626
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
I want a piece of book.

627
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Not mine.

628
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
I think you must夏儿 be sure to help him.

629
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Don't cut it.

630
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Don't cut.

631
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Let's pay him a fine.

632
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Please take time to orientation.

633
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,380
Is it a tourist destination?

634
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,040
Big Mother.

635
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,180
Where is Liu?

636
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,420
What's up?

637
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,260
He's outside.

638
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,820
The police are 162.

639
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,700
Support!

640
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,500
Don't run!

641
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,700
Don't run!

642
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,780
Hold on!

643
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,500
Don't run!

644
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,220
Don't run!

645
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,060
Run!

646
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,660
Go back to the police station first.

647
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,860
I'll talk to you later.

648
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,140
What's wrong?

649
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,980
Are you new here?

650
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,380
I saw you go to the doctor by phone.

651
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,420
Stop!

652
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,780
Don't run!

653
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,940
What are you doing?

654
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,740
Don't catch him!

655
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,460
Hurry up!

656
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,940
Support!

657
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,020
Don't come near!

658
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,500
It's okay!

659
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,420
Who are you?

660
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,380
I'm his teacher.

661
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,260
What's wrong with him?

662
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,580
The ID card tells me to confirm.

663
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,100
ID card.

664
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,700
Okay.

665
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,980
Don't lie to me!

666
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,860
Get lost.

667
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,780
What do you want?

668
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,940
I've been trying to buy a land.

669
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,980
I thought he would say it doesn't mean I'm breadwinner.

670
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,580
He doesn't deserve to work in a farm.

671
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,740
Poor honey,

672
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,460
now that I have you,

673
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,220
You get some bill,

674
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,020
and you just finally come homeay.

675
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,340
Keep you company.

676
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,380
Don't talk to me!

677
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,060
He wants you to work

678
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,060
Let's go.

679
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,060
Hello, good morning.

680
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,060
Hello, good morning.

681
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,060
The three girls are here.

682
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,060
Good morning.

683
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,060
The three girls are here.

684
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Hello, good morning.

685
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,060
Hello, good morning.

686
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,060
You two are here.

687
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
You two are still at home. Don't run around.

688
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,060
Luo Yi, is this the front?

689
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Yes.

690
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,060
Teacher Ye.

691
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,060
Luo Yi.

692
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Take it first.

693
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,060
Take it first.

694
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Take it.

695
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Teacher, I told you before.

696
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,060
You have a man's temperament and a single.

697
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,060
I told you that you have to find me.

698
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,060
I don't have money.

699
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
Why don't you give it to me?

700
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,060
I will give it to you at school.

701
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060
You have to get into the exam in the next 30 days.

702
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,060
You should study first.

703
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,060
Don't care about anything.

704
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
I will help you deal with the court.

705
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,060
It seems that the school can change everything.

706
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,060
How important is the study?

707
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,060
Curric compartir

708
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Let go of my hand.

709
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
Do you know?

710
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,060
I feel it's not right to study.

711
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
Is it important that you don't study?

712
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,060
Now mom doesn't know where to go.

713
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,060
And she committed suicide.

714
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Is that why you have to think about how to study well first

715
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
to have hope?

716
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Without getting into high school, there is no future?

717
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
That's not what I mean.

718
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
I just hope that he can stop caring about those things that can't be solved.

719
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
Study hard and study hard.

720
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,060
Work hard

721
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,060
is to build on good luck and good background

722
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,060
to change.

723
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,060
He can now think of the money to be returned

724
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,060
to protect his sister and be a driver

725
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,060
and is already thinking about the hardest thing in his life experience.

726
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,060
So you mean I'm wrong.

727
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
My will...

728
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,060
My will is that there is no right or wrong in the two worlds.

729
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,060
Two worlds?

730
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,060
You always say that we are two worlds.

731
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,060
Then you are just playing with me.

732
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,060
And from the beginning to the end, you don't want to participate in this kind of gathering.

733
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,060
How wrong is it to be sitting next to a bad person?

734
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,060
Yes.

735
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,060
I don't want to participate in this gathering.

736
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,060
I will do my best to be safe.

737
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,060
And I don't have a hundred years of experience.

738
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,060
I've been working hard to laugh.

739
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,060
Besides, I've been serious with you since I was a kid.

740
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,060
But you just can't show that you hate the person you are.

741
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Do you think that these people in our family

742
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,060
are all good and good-for-nothing?

743
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,060
I don't hate Gao Zhen Guang.

744
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,060
If I didn't meet your family today,

745
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
he wouldn't have come home so soon.

746
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,060
So I hate people who are good and good-for-nothing.

747
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,060
Although I don't know if he will come out so soon

748
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,060
to eat good food or not to study well,

749
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,060
I will be so embarrassed to do this.

750
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,060
I will find you if I need money.

751
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,060
You can't be so stubborn

752
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,060
and think that I hate people who are good and good-for-nothing.

753
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,060
Remember the first point.

754
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
Qi Wei.

755
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
Qi Wei.

756
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,060
Wake up.

757
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
Qi Wei.

758
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,060
I need to talk to you.

759
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,060
Don't go in.

760
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,060
You haven't made a mistake for a long time.

761
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,060
I'm sorry.

762
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,060
It's too much pressure to be with me.

763
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,060
I'm tired of being a pervert every day.

764
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,060
Let's break up.

765
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,060
I finally became a pervert every day.

766
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,060
I'm curious

767
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,060
why Jin You recommended me to you.

768
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,060
Don't you want to choose me

769
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,060
to be a pervert?

770
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,060
Yes, I'm his poor talent.

771
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060
You're handsome, okay?

772
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,060
You're the same handsome guy.

773
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,060
Thank you for being together for the past two months.

774
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,060
I'm sorry.

775
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,060
I'm sorry.

776
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,060
Mom, come back.

777
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,060
Whatever.

778
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,060
I'm sorry.

779
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,060
Are you the head of the high school?

780
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,060
Yes.

781
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,060
He really saved you.

782
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:15,060
So you're Luo Yu and Luo Hui.

783
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,060
After you finish your meal,

784
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,060
go pack your things and go back with me to my place.

785
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,060
I've already asked Jin Jia to help me.

786
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,060
I'll be there soon.

787
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,060
I left a note on the wall.

788
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,060
I wanted to tell him you two were there.

789
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,060
I'll pick it up and come back.

790
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,060
Wait.

791
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,060
You made it clear.

792
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,060
My dad is a psycho.

793
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,060
I'm going to take us back to your place.

794
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,060
Your dad didn't do it on purpose.

795
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
He's ill.

796
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,060
He didn't do it on purpose.

797
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,060
Do you know that?

798
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,060
I'm your uncle.

799
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,060
I can't leave you alone.

800
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,060
Come.

801
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,060
Can I have a look at you?

802
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,060
Put it here, too.

803
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,060
Put it over here.

804
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,060
Put things here first.

805
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,060
Here, take them as you like.

806
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,060
I'll tell you.

807
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,060
I don't feel good when you put them in.

808
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,060
Mom.

809
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,060
Yes.

810
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,060
You are a blind man?

811
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,940
I am a blind man

812
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,100
I am a blind man, I am a blind man

813
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,240
I am a blind man, I am a blind man

814
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,240
I am a blind man

815
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I am a blind man, I am a blind man

816
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,280
Put your things here, it's okay

817
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,780
I am going to talk to my mom

818
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,780
If you are hungry, you can eat it yourself

819
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,780
Wait a minute

820
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,960
You are so smart

821
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,960
You are a blind man

822
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,960
You are a blind man

823
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,160
What do you want to tell your dad?

824
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
You don't know what I am thinking

825
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
You are a blind man

826
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,360
You are a blind man

827
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
You are a blind man

828
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,860
You are a blind man

829
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,860
You are a blind man

830
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,860
I am a blind man

831
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,860
This is not the point

832
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,360
Now, the village people are not talking

833
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,860
You know this is a big issue

834
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,360
You don't know what to tell them

835
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,360
But you are a blind man

836
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,360
I don't know what you are thinking

837
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,360
You are a blind man

838
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
I am a blind man

839
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,860
I feel that high-ranking people

840
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,360
I am a blind man

841
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,360
I am a blind man

842
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,860
He is a person

843
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,860
You are a blind man

844
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,860
You are a blind man

845
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,860
He is a blind man

846
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,860
You are a blind man

847
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,860
Yes

848
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,400
How do you know it faucet

849
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,460
How do you know it faucet

850
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,960
It's small

851
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,060
What if he doesn't change

852
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,560
I want to make it bigger

853
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
Fordлам was sleeping

854
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,840
Let's go

855
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,780
Hello?

856
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,780
The driver is here.

857
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,780
We'll meet up at 6am tomorrow.

858
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,780
You're going to be here tomorrow?

859
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,780
What's wrong with you?

860
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,780
I'll leave the rehearsal room.

861
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,780
Okay, you go to the car first.

862
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,780
I'll tell you on the way.

863
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,780
I'll be back at 6am.

864
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,780
I'll go back as soon as I get the report.

865
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,780
Okay.

866
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,780
I still haven't seen you.

867
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,780
I'll go to the car.

868
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,780
I'll pick you up.

869
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
Where's the car?

870
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,780
Why is it so convenient to buy wine?

871
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,780
You stole it from me?

872
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,780
I'm leaving.

873
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,780
I'm going to the car tomorrow.

874
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,780
I can't do it.

875
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,780
Help me pick them up.

876
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,780
It's okay.

877
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,780
You're busy.

878
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,780
I just resigned.

879
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,780
I'm in a hurry.

880
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,780
You resigned?

881
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,780
What did you say?

882
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,780
Are you resigned or resigned?

883
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,780
You're the one who's resigned.

884
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,780
Okay, you're busy.

885
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,780
You haven't changed the world.

886
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,780
Change yourself faster.

887
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,780
You're going to quit.

888
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,780
I'm going to quit my job.

889
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,780
I'm going to quit my job.

890
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,780
You're okay?

891
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,780
I'm going.

892
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,780
You're okay?

893
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,780
Betty.

894
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,780
Okay, I'm going.

895
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,780
I'm going.

896
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,780
I'm going.

897
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,780
How's it going?

898
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,780
The meeting in the interview room is just in time.

899
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,780
I'll contact the meeting at the police station first.

900
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,780
You're in the dark now.

901
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,780
Your mom just called you.

902
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,780
What's wrong with you two?

903
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,780
I'm sorry.

904
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,780
Can you read about this at my office and report on it?

905
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,780
Yes.

906
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,780
Read it?

907
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,780
I don't want to know how you did this.

908
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,780
I already said it.

909
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,780
I read it right?

910
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,780
This one?

911
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,780
This one.

912
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,780
This one.

913
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,780
Come.

914
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,680
Come.

915
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,780
I'll go get some more.

916
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,780
Why didn't you eat the milk?

917
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,780
You're afraid of your brother and you don't dare to eat it?

918
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,780
I like bread.

919
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,780
They don't want to touch the child of the big meal.

920
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,780
So sorry, you and him...

921
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,780
Don't want to touch the big mother.

922
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,780
It's not 9999, they've left.

923
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,780
What big mother?

924
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,780
That's a woman.

925
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,780
Your sister is very clear.

926
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,780
Yes.

927
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,780
You're very rude and you don't know anything.

928
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,780
I can't do anything about it.

929
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,780
Did you still find your mother?

930
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,780
I'm still looking for her.

931
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,780
Are they going to get married?

932
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,780
I haven't seen your mother.

933
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,780
I don't know who she is.

934
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,780
But I think...

935
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,780
We need to maintain a stable medical care.

936
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,780
We have family and friends.

937
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,780
Let's talk about your medical record.

938
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,780
The record of the general patient is 1%

939
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,780
and the record of the general patient is 8-12 times.

940
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,780
That is to say, even if the risk is 10 times,

941
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,780
you still have 90% of the record.

942
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,780
You're so naughty.

943
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,780
It's naughty and it's true.

944
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,780
Keep exercising.

945
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,780
There's a bookmark window.

946
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,780
You can get a big number of cases of patients.

947
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,780
You're so naughty.

948
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,780
I'm not.

949
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,780
I'm so naughty.

950
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,780
Maybe you have a little bit of alcohol.

951
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,780
You know, your brain is being sucked in by alcohol.

952
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,780
Yes, I have a little bit of alcohol.

953
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,780
I'm so bad.

954
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,780
I can't drink.

955
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,780
I can't guess what I'm drinking.

956
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,780
I'm going to puke.

957
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,780
I'm going to puke.

958
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,780
Where are you going?

959
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,780
I'm going to puke.

960
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,780
Mojia.

961
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,780
Can I ask you a favor?

962
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,780
Come.

963
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,780
I'd like to ask you a favor.

964
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,780
Thank you.

965
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,780
Aралager.

966
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,940
&

967
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,780
The painting piece...

968
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,780
bid well together.

969
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,780
It's designed to be natural to the black lyrics.

970
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,780
That's it?

971
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,940
We'll do it ourselves.

972
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,140
Lin Zhang.

973
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,780
Tell you not to come. You have to come.

974
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:07,180
Your mother-in-law is going to take care of everything.

975
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,340
I'll go to the hospital.

976
