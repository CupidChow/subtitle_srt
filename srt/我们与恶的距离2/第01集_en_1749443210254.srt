Hello

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm the doctor of the department of health

Lin Yijun

73
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
I'm the doctor of the department of health

74
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
This is our...

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
This is our team

76
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
We'll spend a few days to understand your situation

77
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
The test and assessment will be related

78
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
It's all about the treatment

79
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Ma Yishi, we have more cases today

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
We have a few to discuss with you

81
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,840
There are two people in the private community who are going to fight for the common medicine

82
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,840
What's going on?

83
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
The police are all here

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Is that Ah Ji?

85
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Stop

86
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,840
He's not a good guy, he's not a bad guy either

87
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
He's not a criminal, I don't know how to handle it

88
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,840
You can give him a hand if you want to

89
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
He's a good guy

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
He's a good guy

91
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
He's a good guy

92
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
I'm going to tell you what to do

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,840
You can tell the police that he's a criminal

94
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
He's a mental doctor

95
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Everyone can decide

96
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Yes, you're a good guy

97
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,840
You're a criminal, you have to be careful

98
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Ma Yishi

99
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
What's going on?

100
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Wait a minute, Ma Yishi

101
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Ma Yishi

102
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Don't run, I'm going to run

103
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
I can't hear you

104
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Don't run

105
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Help me

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
It's dangerous

107
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Help me

108
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
I'm going to call the police

109
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Help me

110
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Help me

111
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Help me

112
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Help me

113
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Help me

114
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Help me

115
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Ma Yishi, I'm really sorry

116
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Can you give your wife a ride?

117
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Sure, I'll take her to the hospital

118
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Ma Yishi, long time no see

119
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
How are you? Are you hurt?

120
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
I have a friend who's been in a bad condition

121
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,840
I suspect he has some problems with his health

122
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I don't know what to do

123
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Come, take the car

124
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
I'm just going to drive him away

125
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,840
If I have the chance, can you go to their house to have a look?

126
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,840
We have a lot of cases today, please don't go today

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
I'll talk to your friend

128
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
I'll contact him right away

129
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840

Mr. Ma

135
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
He's a senior in the Chinese Communist Party

136
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
He's a senior in the Chinese Communist Party

137
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
He's from a local village

138
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
He's from a province

139
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
I'd like to thank

140
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840

141
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
He's a senior in the Communist Party

Our family is very close

144
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
We're not close to each other

145
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,840
But we're close to each other

146
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
We're very close to each other

147
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
We're very close to each other

Thank you

00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Wait a minute

150
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
I'll ask them to drive the car over

151
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Go

152
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Hey, wait

153
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Wait a minute

154
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
The high-ranking official is the president

155
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,840
We'll talk to him later

156
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
That's right

157
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,840
You're the light of the youth

158
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
I don't know what to say

159
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Right?

160
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
The high-ranking official is the leader of the party

161
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
He's the leader of the party

162
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
He's the leader of the party

163
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840

He's a leader

165
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
You're the leader of the party

166
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
How can you be so quiet?

167
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Well, I'm just a senior

168
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
I'm not good at talking

169
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
I don't know how to talk

170
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
You don't have to

171
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Don't talk to me

172
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
You're a senior in the Communist Party

173
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Why do you talk to me?

174
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
I'm just a senior

175
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
You're a senior in the Communist Party

176
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
No one is a senior

177
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
No

178
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I'm not good at talking

179
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840
I'm just a senior

180
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
I'm just a senior

181
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
I'm just a senior

182
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm just a senior

183
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Why don't you let the public know?

184
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
About security

185
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I see that you're safe

186
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
In the end, we provide

187
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
a safe, comfortable, and convenient

188
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
high-quality railway transportation service

189
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
This is a key slogan

190
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
You've been talking for over 30 years

191
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
How many people are going to sacrifice?

192
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Report to the committee

193
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
You can't deal with every detail

194
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,840
We'll discuss security in the law

195
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
We're communicating with the public

196
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Security is our first consideration

197
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,840
You're telling me that security is your first consideration

198
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
But there's no

199
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
any cost-adjustment plan

200
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Every day, the railway is open

201
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
The average is 5 million

202
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
How do you maintain security

203
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
What's more absurd is that

204
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
I see that you're not good enough

205
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
in the public

206
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Xiao Qiao

207
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
A-Zha

208
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
What's wrong?

209
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Dr. Ma is too exaggerated

210
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
He's just been shot

211
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
by the patient

212
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
You're filming a movie?

213
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
You know that

214
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Dr. Ma just got here

215
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
A-Zha, it's not going to work

216
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
It'll be a big trouble

217
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Okay, I got it

218
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Help me carry the medicine

219
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Director

220
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm the ICU at the next door

221
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
The doctor is in the hospital

222
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
You think I'm willing to do it?

223
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,840
I've been in the hospital for 20 years

224
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
I've been in the hospital for 20 years

225
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,840
So Dr. Ma is the one who's in the hospital

226
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
I'm the one who's in the hospital

227
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
You think I'm the one who's in the hospital?

228
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
We all know that

229
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
a doctor is a good doctor

230
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
But

231
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,840
is it the same as a doctor?

232
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Dr. Ma

233
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Hello

234
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
You're not good enough to be in the hospital

235
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
The pain is so deep

236
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I can't take it

237
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
This is the experience

238
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
that you've been suffering from

239
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
from your childhood

240
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
You're not good enough to be in the hospital

241
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm telling you

242
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
It's not your fault

243
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm afraid that you'll get hurt

244
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
It's better to be in the hospital

245
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
You're not good enough to be in the hospital

246
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Excuse me, I'm sorry

247
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Don't do it

248
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
You're not good enough to be in the hospital

249
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
I'm not good enough to be in the hospital

250
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm telling you

251
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Thank you

252
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
I'm always reminding you

253
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
If you still treat me as your teacher

254
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,840
You have to do things right

255
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Don't think about the government

256
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
providing you with resources

257
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,840
You'll be in the back of the car

258
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
How could I just sit there and talk about it?

259
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Do you have anything else

260
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
other than the administrative team?

261
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Have you changed anything?

262
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
You thought you were an NGO?

263
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
I can't let the matter of the railway

264
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
be a matter of human life

265
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
That's just not your idea

266
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Other people are arguing about human life

267
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Of course I can understand

268
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
your past experiences

269
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
So I can understand why you

270
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
have a special sense of responsibility

271
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
But I have to remind you

272
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
The election is coming

273
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Do you really want to see

274
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
the government's position?

275
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Hello?

276
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
I've told you what I should say

277
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Please think it over

278
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Don't just let the future

279
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
be in your hands

280
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Do you still remember

281
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
why you called me

282
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
to the public office?

283
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
You told me

284
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
that the public office wanted to change

285
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
I just remember

286
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
you can be the election

287
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
based on the resources

288
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,840
provided by the public office

289
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
and the votes

290
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Remember

291
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
what we said you were

292
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
and what you are

293
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
You said you saw Hong Yun for the first time

294
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
What did you do?

295
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
I was going to get a new job

296
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Sorry

297
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Cheng Daqi's family is here

298
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
They look very upset

299
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
when they see you outside

300
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Come out

301
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Come out

302
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
What are you doing?

303
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Wait a minute

304
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
Go out

305
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Go out now

306
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Go out

307
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Is it your mother?

308
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
I'll report to Cheng Daqi

309
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
I don't want to

310
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
I'm afraid that

311
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
the people in the public office are afraid of me

312
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
What are you going to do?

313
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
You're a doctor

314
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
and a lawyer

315
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm telling you

316
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
I'm afraid that

317
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
I'll be in trouble

318
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
I'm telling you

319
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
The public office is a lawyer

320
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
and a lawyer

321
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
and a police officer

322
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Don't you have any idea?

323
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
You're also a thief

324
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
You don't even have to report

325
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
We're not your enemies

326
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Remember

327
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
If you have the ability

328
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
you should report to the police

329
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
to sell your son to the drug dealers

330
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
You're right

331
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
He's not a thief

332
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
You're talking nonsense

333
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm telling you

334
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
You're going to sell your son to the drug dealers

335
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
I'll show you

336
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,840
You can take your son anywhere

337
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm a lawyer

338
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
and a lawyer

339
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
He's been using the money

340
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
He's been using the money

341
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
to sell his son to the drug dealers

342
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
He's been using the money

343
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
He's also a lawyer

344
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
He's also a lawyer

345
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
and a lawyer

346
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
You're right

347
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
If he uses the money

348
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
he'll be better

349
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
If he uses the money

350
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
he'll be better

351
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
If you're in trouble

352
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
you should report to the police

353
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
You're a thief

354
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
People like you

355
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
or you

356
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
are all honest

357
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
You're really a thief

358
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
I'm telling you

359
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
I'm telling you

360
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
You're a suspect

361
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
You're not a suspect

362
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
You're a murderer

363
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
You're a murderer

364
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
What's wrong with you?

365
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
I'll go check

366
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
I'll go check

367
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
I'm the boss of the police

368
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Are you crazy?

369
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
You're not even able to understand

370
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Let me take care of you

371
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Don't worry

372
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
I'll look after you

373
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
Go

374
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
Come

375
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Help Chen's mother take care of her

376
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Let me take care of you

377
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Chen's mother has been very upset

378
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,840
She must be stimulated

379
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,840
You also said something straightforward

380
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
I know that the drug dealers

381
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,840
will ruin the relationship

382
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840
I know there will be a crowd

383
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,840
If you want to change your job, I can just talk to you.

384
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,340
But if you don't admit your child is ill,

385
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
then the child really won't be saved.

386
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
We can do it on our own.

387
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,340
We need to rely on our family and our social services.

388
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,840
We need to have more...

389
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,340
We really can do it.

390
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,340
I'll introduce you to a very experienced psychologist.

391
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
I have a door.

392
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,840
Doctor.

393
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,040
Doctor.

394
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,340
I know you've been using your own way to treat the wound.

395
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,540
But from the accident to now, it's been months.

396
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,340
I feel like you've been very resistant to the wound.

397
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,040
Is it my misunderstanding?

398
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Or is there any reason to tell me?

399
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,140
Secretary.

400
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,840
I have a good medicine.

401
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,840
Thank you.

402
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Thank you.

403
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
I'm really sorry.

404
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
You're the one who's been treating the wound.

405
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
You're so sorry.

406
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,340
I'm so sorry that I can't accept it.

407
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,840
I've been through this.

408
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
I can't accept it.

409
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,340
I'm sorry.

410
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,340
What are you talking about?

411
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,840
I really can't accept it.

412
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
If you don't admit your child is ill,

413
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
I'll be a good doctor.

414
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
If you want to be a good doctor, I'll give you a good treatment.

415
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
I'll give you a good treatment.

416
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Let's waste food.

417
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,340
I think I'm wasting food.

418
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,840
You can try it yourself.

419
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,340
It's better to eat it with the sauce.

420
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,340
I don't want to eat it.

421
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
I'll eat more with you.

422
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,340
I have a lot left.

423
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,840
I'm taking the medicine.

424
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,340
I'll buy a new tableware.

425
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,340
I don't want it.

426
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
I'm already very serious about taking the medicine.

427
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm serious about work.

428
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,340
I'm not serious about my emotions.

429
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,840
So, don't keep staring at me.

430
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Give me a box of this.

431
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
This is for you.

432
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Why?

433
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Why?

434
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Gao Zhengong is so concerned about our medical rights.

435
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,840
And I guess he mentioned the law of the defense of the nine-card game.

436
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,340
He didn't pass.

437
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,840
Did he get two cards and nine cards?

438
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
The two cards are the best.

439
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
The law of the defense is the national defense.

440
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Their job is to supervise the law and repair the law.

441
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
They are all serving Hong Bai Tian every day.

442
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
They are all serving Hong Bai Tian every day.

443
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
I think so.

444
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
But he is the law of the defense.

445
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,840
He is supposed to be the one to serve him.

446
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
No matter what the choice is, you should be the one to serve him.

447
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,340
I'm so tired.

448
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,340
I want to rest.

449
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Well...

450
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,540
Let me tell you this, everyone.

451
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,880
You're the one who's so unsightly.

452
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,280
I guess it's okay this way.

453
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,620
But this is just the case.

454
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,760
Guan, why are you taking the meal with you?

455
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,700
My parents are checking the database.

456
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,960
I said I'd students with High School一定 backpiano student's music.

457
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,340
The five of them are acting so woody.

458
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,760
Not at all!

459
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,200
Everything's ready.

460
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,960
I cooked it myself.

461
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,540
Look at our differences.

462
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,220
We've only been friends for two months.

463
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,060
I don't think it's too fast.

464
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,900
Is it important to you to see if it's true?

465
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
I...

466
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,600
It's okay.

467
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,100
Don't force it.

468
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,200
Okay.

470
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
I'll go talk to the director.

471
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Let's see if there's anyone who can make a choice.

472
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,100
Then I'll tell mom and dad that you agreed.

473
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,300
Go in.

474
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Okay, then you can go home and talk to me.

475
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Bye.

476
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
The End

477
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Dad, can I have this today?

478
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
I want to watch TV.

479
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
You can read it yourself.

480
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
You read it.

481
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Mingyu, I want to see your cooking.

482
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Let's go together.

483
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Go.

484
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
I want to see this.

485
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
You two.

486
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,100
Who's the one who's going to be the one to spray the kitchen?

487
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Mingyu.

488
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Mingyu

489
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
I'm full.

490
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
You go back.

491
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Great.

492
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
I...

493
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
I'm telling you.

494
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Before the victim was sentenced to death, I wouldn't kill him.

495
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Go back.

496
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
You're wrong.

497
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
I'm dying.

498
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
You're dying.

499
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
I'm going to shut up this sentence.

500
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
As a lawyer,

501
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
I've already given enough support to your power.

502
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
I've been living here for a few days.

503
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
He asked me to ask you.

504
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
He wants to move to my house.

505
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
He's afraid you'll find Jingjing.

506
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
You're his sister.

507
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
You go to find Jingjing.

508
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
I'll tell him you beat your mother up.

509
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
Let's go.

510
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
I need a place to hide.

511
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
You stay here for a few days.

512
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
How about this?

513
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Can I?

514
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
She wants to kill you so bad.

515
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
I'll ask.

516
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
You're enough to talk to the murderer.

517
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Now the murderer got back at her.

518
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
You're imaginarized now.

519
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
We've come over because...

520
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,100
...to have品 URLs ofpianoimated to a few degrees.

521
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Can scan this in advance?

522
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
No, no.

523
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Yes?

524
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,700
Sister Lu.

525
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
What?

526
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,800
I didn't get the report from the report.

527
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
I was just about to tell you.

528
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,300
The report from the report from the report from the report from the report from the report.

529
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,700
It's not enough.

530
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,400
Look.

531
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,900
It's snowing.

532
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,500
It's snowing.

533
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
The computer is too slow.

534
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,600
It's faster.

535
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,700
It's so smooth.

536
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,200
How can you do that?

537
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,700
I'm going to class.

538
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,500
Okay.

539
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
Eat one.

540
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,100
If you still forget, don't forget.

541
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
Miss Jianqin Hui.

542
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,900
Please come in.

543
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,500
Wait a minute.

544
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,500
You've been in the hospital for three months?

545
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,300
No.

546
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,700
I've been unable to sleep recently.

547
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,700
I've been having chest problems and heart problems.

548
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,100
I don't take medicine this week. I can't take medicine at 3 p.m. at 11 p.m.

549
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,300
Did something happen?

550
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,500
I quarreled with Yi Yi.

551
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,500
I can't help you about feelings.

552
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,300
Can you tell him not to be a official?

553
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,700
He has more than 30,000 subscribers in a month.

554
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,500
What's wrong?

555
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,900
Are you a official or a personal relative?

556
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,100
I didn't mean that.

557
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,700
I just wanted to say that we were worried about the gap.

558
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,100
You know that we...

559
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
He's been in the hospital for two months.

560
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
What's wrong?

561
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,100
What's the problem?

562
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,100
I'll help you adjust the sleep problem.

563
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Okay.

564
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
I'll do the tests and check the evidence.

565
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Maybe I can help you.

566
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,700
The lawyer also wants you to cooperate.

567
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,700
Why don't you let me talk to the lawyer?

568
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,500
You can't let me answer the phone.

569
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Then what's the reason you didn't write it?

570
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,500
Let me answer the phone.

571
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,000
If I let you answer the phone,

572
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,100
will you thank me?

573
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,100
I have the right to answer the phone.

574
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,200
He's calling with whom?

575
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,100
Why isn't any wallet ringing?

576
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,300
That's too gentle of a emotion.

577
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
She even smiles.

578
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,100
Could it be my girlfriend?

579
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,300
The one who is on the road.

580
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,700
Li Zi Qing.

581
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,700
That person will not leave in a flash.

582
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,300
What about her family?

583
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,900
Father, mom, brother and brother are still in Europe.

584
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,500
Daddy says the key is in the status of our home country.

585
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
My brother and brother are in Europe now.

586
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,000
My dad said that he would contact us next month.

587
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,500
But family relations are not good.

588
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,000
It shouldn't be like this to your family.

589
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
General.

590
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
You lost.

591
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
You can't go to the death row.

592
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Why are you going like this?

593
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Ma Yishi.

594
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Look at him.

595
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
He doesn't even admit defeat.

596
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
There's no one.

597
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
He doesn't know where you are.

598
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
What happened?

599
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Cheng Pu.

600
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Ma Yishi.

601
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Cheng Pu, Cheng Pu.

602
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Are you okay?

603
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I'm okay.

604
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
Take the car out.

605
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm okay.

606
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Cheng Pu, help me take the car.

607
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,500

2008, get in.

609
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
It's the same.

610
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Bring her up.

611
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Please bring her up.

TheMT troublesomeHeHappyOneBoss.

628
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Ten racial friends are being attacked.

630
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,420

I'm sorry.

656
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,420
I'm sorry.

657
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
I'm sorry.

658
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
I'm sorry.

659
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,340
I'm sorry.

660
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
I'm sorry.

661
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,340

I'm sorry.

678
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
I'm sorry.

679
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,340
I'm sorry.

680
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
I'm sorry.

681
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340

682
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,340

683
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,340
I'm sorry.

684
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,340
I'm sorry.

685
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
I'm sorry.

686
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
I'm sorry.

687
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
I'm sorry.

688
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm sorry.

689
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
I'm sorry.

690
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
I'm sorry.

691
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
I'm overjoyed.

692
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,260
I'm overjoyed.

693
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,260
I'm sorry.

694
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,260
I'm sorry.

695
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
You had your self-promotion over your father.

696
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
Is he sure of this?

697
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,260
I tried too hard just now.

698
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,260
Before we sont in my heart.

699
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,260
What's wrong?

700
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
I think youostic is a classic.

701
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,260
but he reacts beautifully.

702
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,260
Inside is different.

703
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
We need use of DOP.

704
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,260
Thank you

705
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,260
What about the case of the independent film production?

706
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,260
The time and environment of the film are not in harmony with the program

707
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,260
And there is no tool to protect yourself

708
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,260
What will you do with the director today?

709
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
I can pass the law with Li

710
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,260
And the other party will agree, right?

711
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,260
I care about your safety

712
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,260
Gao Zhen Guang is a good man

713
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,260
He can marry himself

714
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
He is a man of the world

715
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,260
He is handsome and handsome

716
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,260
He is not a famous man

717
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,260
He is also a man of the world

718
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Could the representative be the head of the Chinese Cuisine and Guards?

719
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,260
Xiao Chuan, did you think about him?

720
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,260
He is to resist the cadets at her mother and his friends

721
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,260
hearing nothing

722
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,260
What about the parents?

723
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,260
We still say that if we accept Gao Zhen Guang as Yu's son

724
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,260
I am handing him the bill

725
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,260
What should we do with him?

726
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,260
The government covers all the cases

727
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,260
He's a very strict wife.

728
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,260
You chose Li Wei to be the judge.

729
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,260
You're so boring.

730
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,260
You see what's in every day.

731
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Why don't you turn on the light?

732
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
You'll hurt your eyes.

733
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,260
I'm going to do the eye-catching thing.

734
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,260
What do you think?

735
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Stop giving me a question.

736
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
You haven't eaten yet?

737
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,260
I have time to eat.

738
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Li Wenchen.

739
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,260
How is it?

740
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
You've eaten three days of my braised pork.

741
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
You're not afraid of me being high blooded?

742
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,260
I saw it today.

743
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,260
Why don't you think about it?

744
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,260
What can you do to make me eat different dishes?

745
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
You eat this.

746
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,260
This lady.

747
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,260
I've lost my money in the delivery of Uber.

748
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Now I'm free to eat Uber.

749
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,260
Mr. Siqi, please take care of the six-wheeled car.

750
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
Thank you.

751
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
I'll give you my car.

752
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,260
You haven't gone home yet?

753
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,260
Let's go to the right side.

754
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,260
The car is not picking up my phone.

755
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
I can't find anyone else if I ask you to go.

756
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,260
Is anyone here?

757
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,260
You Ming, Xiao Wei, Lu Yu.

758
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
Xin Xin, you...

759
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,260
Xiao Wei, have you eaten?

760
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,260
I bought a noodle.

761
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
Where's your mom?

762
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,260
She hasn't come back yet. She should be driving.

763
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,260
Someone is sitting in her car.

764
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,260
She calls me every day to get a car.

765
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,260
She said she was looking for a job to make us a useless woman.

766
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,260
She also said she was looking for a man.

767
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,260
Go and wait for me outside.

768
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Do you know if mom has been sleeping lately?

769
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
I don't know.

770
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,260
Sometimes when I'm going to bed, she hasn't come back yet.

771
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Otherwise, she would have been awake when I was going to class.

772
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,260
Is she also out of her mind?

773
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,260
She's been under a lot of pressure lately.

774
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,260
But I didn't answer her.

775
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
If she's at home every day,

776
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,260
she should tell me that I'll call a doctor to come home.

777
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,260
Lu Yu, you can keep your mom in mind these days.

778
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,260
Don't talk to her. Don't be angry.

779
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,260
Try your best.

780
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,260
Go to bed.

781
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Go to bed.

782
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,260
I'm so sorry.

783
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,260
This is the first time I've ever seen a woman like this.

784
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,260
I think we should still have a long-term relationship.

785
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,260
Why is that? I was going to let her graduate.

786
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
But she's always in a bad mood.

787
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Maybe she wants to marry her family.

788
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
She's been very supportive.

789
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,260
I think she's going to be very supportive.

790
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
I'm sorry.

791
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,260
Doctor, you're going in?

792
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,260
You're not sick anymore.

793
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,260
I just got off work and I'm going to eat with you.

794
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,260
Come with me. I'm so hungry.

795
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,260
Let's go.

796
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,260
What do you want to eat?

797
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
I want to eat a lot of meat.

798
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,260
I'm hungry.

799
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,260
I'm hungry.

800
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,260
What do you want to eat?

801
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
I'm hungry.

802
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,260
I'm thinking about what I want to eat.

803
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
It's better to eat this.

804
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,260
I haven't been like this for a long time since I was with her.

805
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
I'm going to put on a dress.

806
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,260
I feel like I'm far away from being on this platform.

807
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,260
You're going to eat with her?

808
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Yes, I've thought about it.

809
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,260
But I feel that the new chief executive or official

810
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,260
can be more understanding and companion.

811
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,260
To understand is to understand your friends' real estate.

812
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
It's hard to be the first.

813
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,260
Are you sure it's hard to be the first?

814
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
I think so.

815
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,260
I heard that she hasn't been in contact for more than three months.

816
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,260
It's convenient to sneak out.

817
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,260
She's a nurse.

818
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,260
She's a top-notch.

819
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,260
It's too much.

820
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,260
Enough.

821
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,260
Promise me.

822
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
Don't do stupid things.

823
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,260
Don't do anything that would harm you or anyone else.

824
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,260
Then I'll leave.

825
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,260
I'll trust you.

826
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
I'll.

827
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Or I'll go in and do my own thing.

828
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,260
You'll take me as an excuse for not being there.

829
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,260
I want to be alone.

830
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,260
I don't want you to always be by my side.

831
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,260
You're telling me that my family is just me.

832
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,260
I'm living through this alone.

833
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,260
I don't want to live in the prison.

834
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Wow, he's a good man.

835
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
He's so nice.

836
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,260
He's so nice.

837
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,260
Phone.

838
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,260
I'm in a bad state.

839
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,260
I can't take care of myself.

840
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
Don't worry.

841
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,260
Go back and rest.

842
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
Thank you.

843
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:48,260
I can only feel the peace when I'm alone.

844
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,260
And the treasure.

845
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,260
I can live in this house.

846
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,260
Why don't you let me go?

847
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,260
I really want to be a dreamer.

848
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,260
I'm really tired.

849
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,260
Why do you want to be like them?

850
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
Do you think

851
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,260
you'll take the treasure with you to the hospital?

852
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,260
I don't think so.

853
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260
I know him well.

854
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,260
But it's hard to keep the treasure.

855
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,260
I think he doesn't like

856
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:01,260
being a son-in-law.

857
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,260
What?

858
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,260
There's a car.

859
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,260
God.

860
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,260
Why do you guys come here at this time of the night?

861
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
Exercise.

862
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,260
What?

863
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,260
You're not feeling well.

864
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,260
You're so weird.

865
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,260
I'm going to...

866
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,260
It's quite tiresome.

867
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,260
We're away from home.

868
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,260
After you hear those strange things,

869
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,260
how come you're not feeling up anymore?

870
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,260
Nothing?

871
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,260
Because the painting made us放Нy self- sickness.

872
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,300
Because

873
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
it's about being home.

874
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,260
His mother went to school one day at night

875
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,260
and apologized to the teachers, classmates and parents

876
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,260
I walked on the road and saw him

877
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,260
I didn't admit that he was my own child

878
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,260
It was his mother who didn't give up

879
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,260
She pulled my hand in every night

880
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,260
She begged and apologized

881
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,260
We didn't teach our children

882
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,260
So we gave it to the teacher

883
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,260
I didn't expect that Niu He

884
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,260
would become our family's pride

885
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,260
I didn't expect that

886
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,260
he would take her away so soon

887
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,260
It should be heaven

888
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,260
He needs someone like Niu He

889
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:29,260
I don't know what you said to Niu He

890
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,260
I wrote it down

891
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,260
in my heart

892
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,260
I believe that Niu He will be a good son

893
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,260
He will be a good son

894
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,260
and will have many children

895
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:54,260
I believe that Niu He will be a good son

896
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,260
Not only that

897
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:09,260
I still have some reasons even though I can't give up

898
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:12,260
It's time to do it

899
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,260
The End

900
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,260
Xiao Qiao, where are you? The doctor has come in.

901
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,260
Hurry up.

902
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,260
I'm almost there.

903
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,260
I'll talk to you later.

904
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,260
Ma Yixing.

905
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,260
Ma Yixing.

906
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,260
You... She's out.

907
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,260
Ma Yixing, bring her in.

908
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,260
I remember the first time I saw you.

909
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:30,260
I want to forget you every day.

910
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,260
I don't know what I'm talking about.

911
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,260
I want to stay in your heart.

912
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,260
I want to be with you.

913
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,260
The End
