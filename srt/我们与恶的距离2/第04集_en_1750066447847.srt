1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
2019 election spending survey

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
you can see that the spending part of the village

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is from 500,000 to 100,000

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the election is from the county

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and the cost can be 1.5 billion to 2 billion

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Taiwan's election is the world's highest cost

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We voters really need to think about

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
what kind of political figures we need

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
OK, let's do it

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That 就要算進展講一下

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
公正沒有報復 The power and funds are not fullyutenated

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,760
黑晶一定取得 什麼

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
選一個當金土as to make an appointment

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:47,960
好酸精 Right in

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,800
use every 500 yuan to build a local village

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
which managed to sell it for more than US$500

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,460
If it's too Thing going on is...

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,160
do not do this

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,780
I wanna review you

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,940
my local information

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,480
if I want to tell others you're at a loss

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,380
do not do that

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:08,900
if you don't want to go...

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,660
how can we talk about it?

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,820
you expect me to say

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,280
I say my boss'source

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,880
tell me

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,420
if you are not then what…

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,060
It's hard to dislike our fame and anything but...

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,060
What?

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,420
The End

33
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,420
Okay, we're now on the street.

34
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
Call in the number.

35
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Mr Ma, please.

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,420
The whole show is white.

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,420
You're more white than the show.

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,420
Okay, let's do it.

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,420
Mr You.

40
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,420
Hello.

41
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,420
It's like this.

42
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,420
I think that

43
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,420
if we want to make a scene,

44
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,420
we should not only hold hands and hold a party.

45
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,420
Then we should say that others are black.

46
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,420
I want to ask Gao Zhang and Yu Min.

47
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,420
What's your opinion?

48
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,420
Okay, Ms Wu, please.

49
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,420
I'll change the next one.

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm so sorry.

51
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,420
I'm telling you,

52
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,420
women nowadays are more fierce than ghosts.

53
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,420
Look,

54
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,420
I care about the old and the new.

55
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,420
I want to create a happy and hopeful youth line.

56
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,420
Youth line is a life of a rich man.

57
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,420
I don't want to change the old and the new.

58
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,420
It's fruit.

59
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,420
Two men sitting here

60
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,420
are having a happy and hopeful youth line.

61
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,420
What's the meaning of that?

62
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,420
Your action is wrong.

63
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,420
It's too exaggerated.

64
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,420
You're too much.

65
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
You're too much.

66
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,420
Your action is too much.

67
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,420
Who did you call?

68
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
I got a chance.

69
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,420
Hello?

70
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,420
What's going on?

71
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,420
Where are you going?

72
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,420
I'm going to buy some wine.

73
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,420
What are you doing?

74
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,420
I'm going to buy some wine.

75
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
Go and sleep.

76
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,420
Don't say that.

77
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,420
I'm going to buy some wine.

78
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,420
Go and sleep.

79
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
Don't say that.

80
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,420
Li Long.

81
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,420
I don't know what other people are like.

82
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,420
All the credit for our family's credit

83
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,420
are yours.

84
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,420
They're your treasure.

85
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,420
Do you know that

86
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,420
every job he does,

87
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,420
he will deduct his money from the national tax office?

88
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,420
Every boss asks him,

89
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,420
why does the national tax office deduct your money?

90
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,420
Do you know that?

91
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,420
Did he ever tell you?

92
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,420
Are you his sister?

93
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,420
Are you his sister?

94
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Brother.

95
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
Stop drinking, okay?

96
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,420
You should really sleep well.

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,420
If you can't sleep well,

98
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,420
we can go to the doctor.

99
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
If you really love your child,

100
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,420
you should be a kind father.

101
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,420
Don't be like your father.

102
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,420
You're in the police station,

103
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,420
and you admit that you hit your wife.

104
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,420
It's normal for the protective police to apply for it.

105
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,420
They hit me too.

106
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,420
I just...

107
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,420
So you're hoping that

108
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,420
you're going to cancel the protective police

109
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,420
or you're going to sue their family for hurting them?

110
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,420
I'm going to cancel the protective police.

111
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,420
I want to accompany my child.

112
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,420
You're going to cancel the protective police

113
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,420
or you're going to sue your wife?

114
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,420
We can.

115
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,420
You can sue them.

116
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,420
You can file a complaint

117
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,420
for the protective police for ten days.

118
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
It shows that the protective police

119
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,420
is not being punished for any reason.

120
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,420
It needs Mr. Xu to explain the process clearly.

121
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Then I can see my child.

122
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,420
We still have to wait until the court is finalized.

123
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
The medical regulations must be followed.

124
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,420
We can't stop the protective police.

125
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
But we can still make a statement on the case.

126
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,420
Mr. Xu is not violent

127
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,420
with the child.

128
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,420
He was also a very calm father.

129
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,420
He can help a child to meet his child.

130
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,420
Why do I have to meet my own child?

131
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,420
I want the court to make a decision.

132
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,420
It's too unreasonable.

133
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,420
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,420
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,420
How much is the bill?

136
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,420
It's okay.

137
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
You have the bill.

138
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
You can call me if you need it.

139
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,420
This way.

140
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,420
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,420
Ms. Xu, I'll go to the teacher later.

142
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,420
You can't look at the divorce case?

143
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,420
No.

144
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,420
Forget it.

145
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,420
You should care more about the child.

146
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
Go ahead.

147
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,420
If there is any action later,

148
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,420
remember to tell me at any time.

149
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,420
If you have any problems at home,

150
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,420
don't be polite.

151
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
Okay, I'm done.

152
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
It's over.

153
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
It's over.

154
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
I'm telling you.

155
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,420
I was so angry inside.

156
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Do you know how exaggerated Penglai is?

157
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,420
He let the driver

158
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,420
work for more than ten hours a day.

159
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
He didn't take a leave for two months.

160
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,420
Then he went to the office without a job.

161
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
He even told Feng that

162
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
there were so many people dead and injured.

163
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,420
He could have jumped in the car,

164
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,420
but he was still thinking of a way

165
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,420
to stop the car before he died.

166
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,420
What are you doing?

167
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
You're so professional.

168
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,420
You're going to take the initiative

169
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,420
to avoid such a situation.

170
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,420
You're a victim of family problems.

171
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,420
You said I could participate in the first place.

172
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
That's why I'm here.

173
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,420
I think you're not good at thinking.

174
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,420
You have a lot of time.

175
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
You want to spend more time

176
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
with your girlfriend

177
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,420
before you become a soldier.

178
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
You'll come here.

179
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
No.

180
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
No.

181
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,420
I just want to say that...

182
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,420
I just want to say that...

183
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,420
I just want to say that

184
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
if you have so much time,

185
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,420
why don't you run to the library?

186
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,420
Go to the library

187
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,420
and report all the related

188
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,420
to Penglai Railway

189
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,420
for the past few years.

190
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,420
Take it back without a word.

191
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,420
Let's work together.

192
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Study hard.

193
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Thank you, teacher.

194
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Thank you, teacher.

195
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
It's also very good

196
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
to have a good husband

197
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
as the representative of the Taiwanese human rights lawyer.

198
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,420
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

199
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
I'll see you later.

200
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Bye.

201
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,420
See you tomorrow.

202
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,420
I'll see you later.

203
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
Bye.

204
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
Thank you, teacher.

205
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Thank you, teacher.

206
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Bye.

207
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
Bye, teacher.

208
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Bye.

209
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
Bye.

210
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
Bye.

211
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Why are you sleeping?

212
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,420
What's wrong with you?

213
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,420
I'm working at 3.30 a.m. every day.

214
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,420
How do I sleep?

215
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,420
I can tell you that I'm working at the printing factory.

216
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,420
I have 40 employees.

217
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,420
I don't stop working 24 hours a day.

218
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,420
I'm a big-time entertainer.

219
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,420
You're amazing.

220
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,420
My wife came to my house to help me with the household chores.

221
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,420
She worked overtime with me every day.

222
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,420
I was pregnant.

223
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,420
I told you that I was rich and I came here every year.

224
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,420
I was too rich.

225
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,420
You worked hard.

226
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,420
I lied to you about love.

227
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Have you ever thought about it?

228
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,420
What is the most important thing in your life?

229
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,420
I grew up in a school.

230
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,420
I had to spend time to communicate with my children.

231
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,420
You can write down what you want to tell your children.

232
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,420
They will see it in the future.

233
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,420
They will know that you care about them.

234
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,420
They will love you so much.

235
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
They will take care of you.

236
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,420
I want to tell you that I'm a big-time entertainer.

237
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,420
I'm a big-time entertainer.

238
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,420
I'm a big-time entertainer.

239
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,420
I'm a big-time entertainer.

240
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,420
I'm a big-time entertainer.

241
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,420
I'm a big-time entertainer.

242
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,420
I'm a big-time entertainer.

243
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,420
You'll know that in the future.

244
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,420
Be quiet.

245
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,420
You really don't understand.

246
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,420
My brother was so impulsive.

247
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,420
He was like this after the medical failure.

248
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
Money and career are the dignity of men.

249
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
You don't have money or career.

250
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,420
I have at least a little bit of retirement.

251
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,420
I have some land in my hand.

252
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,420
It's really like my dad.

253
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,420
Later, I found that my mom was taken away by my dad.

254
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,420
It's not a money-making thing.

255
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
I'm telling you.

256
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,420
I'm a big-time entertainer now.

257
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,420
I'm telling you.

258
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,420
I'm telling you.

259
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,420
You didn't answer my call.

260
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,420
The public is willing to talk to me.

261
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,420
Why are you so childish?

262
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,420
These security guards are so nice.

263
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,420
But they're just jealous of me.

264
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,420
They just let them kill anyone.

265
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,420
When you're done with the government,

266
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,420
you'll find that the public is like that.

267
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,420
They only know the slogan,

268
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
to be responsible for the mess.

269
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,420
There's always a distance between them and the staff.

270
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,420
The driver...

271
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,420
He didn't check the car.

272
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
He did have a driver.

273
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,420
But the driver was the one who was on the road.

274
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,420
He was the one who was on the road.

275
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,420
He was on the road from the bank to the bank.

276
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
He was on the road because of the heavy traffic.

277
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
That's why the car was accident-free.

278
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
How was it?

279
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,420
There's no way to solve this problem.

280
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Yaya, Sasa wrote a bunch of SOP safety papers.

281
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,420
What about the person who was killed?

282
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Are we living?

283
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Isn't it the basic problem of the police?

284
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Did the police solve the problem?

285
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,420
Or was the police not the one who killed him?

286
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,420
Let's eat first.

287
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,420
What happened?

288
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,420
He's still not back. Did you find him?

289
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,420
I saw him on KQTV.

290
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,420
I found him.

291
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,420
I put the car in the car.

292
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,420
He must be in trouble.

293
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
Where did he go?

294
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
How could it be?

295
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
He called me to save him.

296
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
He didn't want to die.

297
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,420
He's not like that.

298
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,420
I thought you two wouldn't be together.

299
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
You're so lucky.

300
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,420
Why didn't you call me?

301
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,420
What's the matter with you?

302
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,420
There's a car.

303
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
Da Bing.

304
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,420
Da Bing.

305
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
How are you? Are you OK?

306
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,420
You're a traitor.

307
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
You're going to lose your life.

308
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,420
You're going to lose your life.

309
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
You're going to lose your life.

310
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Do you know how to die?

311
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Don't be so strong.

312
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
Don't let me down.

313
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
You're going to die.

314
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
Don't be so strong.

315
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,420
I'll kill you.

316
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,420
You're going to die.

317
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,420
You're going to kill me.

318
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,420
Don't you remember your father?

319
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,420
You killed the police, didn't you?

320
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Zhenming, Zhenming, let me have a look.

321
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,420
Zhenming, wake up.

322
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,420
He said he was a kid.

323
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,420
Zhenming, if anything happens to you,

324
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
what's wrong?

325
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,420
Tell me what's wrong with him.

326
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,420
I'll help you deal with it.

327
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,420
Zhenming, what's wrong with him?

328
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,420
He's in the classroom. We'll wait for him downstairs.

329
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
Let's go.

330
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
Zhenming.

331
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,420
Zhenming, wait for me.

332
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,420
I'm sorry.

333
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
Look at me.

334
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
He's trying to get away from us.

335
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,420
He's trying to get away from us.

336
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
If we really do this,

337
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
we'll have a real reward.

338
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
What reward do you have?

339
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
What reward?

340
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,420
I'm Wang Jingjing, a high school graduate.

341
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,420
How are you?

342
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
I'm not a good student.

343
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
You're so pretty.

344
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,420
It's because of you.

345
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
I don't have any money to buy a house.

346
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,420
You're talking nonsense.

347
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,420
There are many possibilities.

348
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,420
High school students may not want to go home because of you.

349
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,420
They may even let the girls in the house get a home.

350
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,420
I'm leaving.

351
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,420
You're so stubborn.

352
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
You're a girl who doesn't have a home.

353
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,420
Gao Zhengwang,

354
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,420
don't come back when you go out.

355
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,420
You're always looking at your friends.

356
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Look at you.

357
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,420
Gao Zhen, you're so stubborn.

358
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,420
You're trying to get away from us.

359
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,420
You're so stubborn.

360
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
You're so stubborn.

361
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,420
I'll send you back.

362
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
I'll send you back.

363
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,420
I'll send you back.

364
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
What are you doing?

365
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
What are you doing?

366
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,420
I'll take the things you gave Qi to you.

367
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
Wait for me.

368
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Qi.

369
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
What is it?

370
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,420
I gave you the gift.

371
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
What is it?

372
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,420
It's for you.

373
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
I miss you so much.

374
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
When are you going home?

375
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
I'll go with you after I finish the things.

376
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,420
Okay?

377
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,420
I'm going back to work.

378
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
You...

379
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Be good.

380
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,420
I'll think about it.

381
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,420
I'll go with you.

382
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
Gao Zhengwang,

383
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
why did you play with me?

384
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
My mom said I didn't play with you.

385
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
She didn't play with you.

386
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,420
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
Okay.

388
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
I'll be back soon.

389
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Okay.

390
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
I'll take care of it.

391
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,420
Okay.

392
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
I'll take care of it.

393
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,420
I'll be back soon.

394
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,420
I'll be back soon.

395
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Hey.

396
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420
What's the matter?

397
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,420
You're late.

398
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,420
Okay.

399
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
You're late.

400
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
You're not coming home yet?

401
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,420
Yeah.

402
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
What are you saying?

403
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
I have to go.

404
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,420
You're not coming home.

405
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
I'll be back soon.

406
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,420
What's going on?

407
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
What's going on?

408
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,420
What are you saying?

409
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,420
Where's your bag?

410
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,420
Take it out.

411
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,420
What's going on?

412
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
What's going on?

413
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Where's it?

414
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
It's in the bag.

415
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
What's going on?

416
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
You're not coming.

417
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
Yeah.

418
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Take it out.

419
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
You're not coming.

420
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,420
I'm coming.

421
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
You're coming.

422
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
I can't go with you.

423
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
Okay, I'll be right back.

424
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Dad.

425
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,860
You have a wife and a son.

426
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,300
Don't make a fuss.

427
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,700
I don't want to divorce you.

428
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,900
I don't want to be like that.

429
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,940
Go away.

430
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,980
Don't make a fuss.

431
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,100
I don't want to marry you.

432
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,540
If you get married again,

433
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,500
we'll be together forever.

434
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,940
I understand.

435
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,540
I'll be right back.

436
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,300
I...

437
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,060
I don't want to be a wife anymore.

438
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,820
I'll tell you later.

439
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,180
What?

440
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,100
Say it.

441
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,580
I'll tell you later.

442
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
Okay?

443
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,660
I'll go check on the doctor.

444
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,300
He's not here yet.

445
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,340
I'll tell you later.

446
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,180
I'll tell you later.

447
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,700
You'll get married again.

448
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,300
Get married again?

449
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,100
No.

450
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,060
Don't get married again.

451
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,500
This person doesn't look like my special neglect person?

452
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,940
Alright?

453
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,980
Get married again?

454
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,780
You've got a good relationship.

455
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,780
Have mercy.

456
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,820
I understand myself, dad.

457
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,620
listen!

458
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,580
If you don't understand his needs,

459
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,180
come back,

460
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,580
We'll have an affair when he comes.

461
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,380
What?

462
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,540
What wound?

463
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,780
Really?

464
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,220
Did you talk it out?

465
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,820
What do you think?

466
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,460
Come here!

467
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,380
What's your problem?

468
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,620
I didn't get married.

469
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,780
You rocked me.

470
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,340
Why do you look so sorry?

471
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,740
Give it back to your kid if you apologize!

472
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,980
I would take this imprisonment for my影片

473
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,300
That's not true.

474
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,060
weakest

475
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,420
making a man

476
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,060
laedith

477
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,580
I was told two were in a rage

478
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,880
Okay.

479
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,340
The plaque was modified 85 years ago.

480
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,900
The Thank You Class Monitoring Center'sصل

481
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,500
is set up on To guard balance and girls' interests,

482
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,720
in addition to the applauding of the Wait-And-Fendовank Arenas.

483
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,500
What does that mean?

484
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,660
It means you should look at one'sço

485
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,500
and talk to the girls about having competition or support them.

486
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,900
That's after all me!

487
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,840
I'm the one who has C reservoir for kids to go to sleep.

488
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,640
The Josh register won't even make any food!

489
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,020
I'm sorry, I must ask you,

490
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,020
Mr. Xu, where are you working now?

491
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,020
Where do you live?

492
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
I...

493
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,020
I'm living in my sister's house now.

494
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,820
Lawyer, I will definitely find a job soon.

495
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,220
I'm a senior in the senior year.

496
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,220
I see.

497
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Qi Te Qi will always be my life.

498
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,420
No matter how much you spend, you won't have any problems.

499
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,920
I will contact the law firm and see how it will be.

500
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,220
I will do my best.

501
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,620
Thank you.

502
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,220
I'm sorry.

503
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
Even if he finds a job,

504
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
who will take care of the child?

505
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,220
Yes, he's a child's right.

506
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
And I think he...

507
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,220
Sister Yu.

508
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,220
The ordinary people can't afford this lawyer.

509
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,220
I think Mr Xu will have a low chance of getting the right to the right of the law.

510
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
It's hard to handle.

511
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Even if he has a hard time,

512
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
he will find a job immediately,

513
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
and the sister will let him live with the child.

514
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
He can't even support his wife's family.

515
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,220
He has a family record.

516
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,220
Let's think of a way to let him see the child first.

517
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
Mom, I'm back.

518
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,220
What's the matter? Why are you so anxious to ask me to come back?

519
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,220
The champion is weird recently.

520
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,220
He's not eating well and he's not talking.

521
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,220
He seems to have changed his child.

522
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,220
I'll go to your room to see what he's eating.

523
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,220
Mom, you can ask Li Yun directly.

524
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,220
Why did you steal it from his room?

525
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,220
Ask him. Will he tell you?

526
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,220
He's always so ugly.

527
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,220
It seems that he owes millions to him.

528
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,220
I'm back.

529
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,220
Open the door for him.

530
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,220
Okay.

531
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm moving.

532
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
What?

533
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
Champion.

534
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,220
Champion, come and practice.

535
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,220
What's your reward?

536
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,220
The first place in the national team for the champion.

537
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,220
That's great.

538
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,220
Keep it up.

539
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,220
Okay.

540
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,220
You're so romantic.

541
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,220
He just learned it.

542
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
You have to teach him.

543
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
Okay.

544
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
Go.

545
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Great.

546
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,220
Let's play it again.

547
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
The champion is ADHD.

548
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
He's not focused and is active.

549
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,220
He has a little development.

550
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,220
But the doctor said that as long as he's stable,

551
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,220
he can help him to establish confidence.

552
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,220
Actually, many children are now diagnosed with ADHD.

553
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
I know that you've been in good shape recently.

554
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,220
Is it good to eat so little?

555
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,220
The doctor said that the champion just entered primary school.

556
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,220
It's a treatment for the golden flag.

557
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,220
We can do some early-sale classes.

558
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
I hope he can take the medicine.

559
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,220
Look at how patient he is today.

560
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,220
And he hasn't fought with his classmates for days.

561
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,220
Is this medicine going to take a lifetime?

562
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,220
Look at him now. He doesn't even eat.

563
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
The doctor said that he has to take a lifetime.

564
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
He's not going to take a lifetime.

565
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,220
If he doesn't eat,

566
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
this might be the side effect of the medicine.

567
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
I can discuss with the doctor again.

568
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,220
What is ADHD?

569
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,220
You don't know how to deal with it.

570
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,220
I've said before.

571
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,220
Don't bring your mother home.

572
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,220
Mom.

573
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,220
What are you talking about?

574
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,220
I think...

575
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,220
the cause of the problem is the medical field.

576
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,220
They don't have to worry about making money.

577
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,220
What about the patient you just mentioned?

578
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,220
You can go to the medical field.

579
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,220
You said it's the cause of the medical field.

580
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,220
What else can you do?

581
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,220
The doctor said that

582
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,220
the patient is having a fever.

583
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,220
He's not feeling well.

584
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,220
He's having a fever.

585
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,220
He's having a fever.

586
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
He's having a fever.

587
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,220
He's having a fever.

588
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
He's having a fever.

589
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
He's having a fever.

590
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
He's having a fever.

591
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,220
He's having a fever.

592
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,220
He's having a fever.

593
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,220
He's having a fever.

594
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,220
He's having a fever.

595
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,220
He's having a fever.

596
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
That's a good news.

597
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
He's having a fever.

598
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,220
The doctor says he's having a fever.

599
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
He's not feeling well.

600
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
He's having a fever.

601
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
He's having a fever.

602
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

603
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,220
What are you talking about?

604
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,220
I don't know how to take care of your wife.

605
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,220
I don't want to be in your shoes and help you take care of others.

606
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,220
But you're now calling me a coward.

607
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,220
I'm your fan.

608
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,220
I'm not saying that.

609
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,220
She's a little bit too young.

610
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
I don't want to tell you.

611
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Just tell her.

612
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,220
I'm not a fan.

613
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,220
I'm just a fan of you.

614
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,220
I'm not a fan.

615
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,220
You're afraid that I'll be in trouble.

616
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,220
I don't want to tell you.

617
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
I'll do it for you.

618
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
I know.

619
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
I'm just taking care of you.

620
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,220
I'm telling you that you shouldn't be in trouble.

621
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
You're the main judge.

622
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Or I'm just a judge.

623
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
Or you're a hospital judge.

624
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,220
A person's life is a mess.

625
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
You should take care of this.

626
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,220
What are you talking about?

627
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,220
I'm just looking at the evidence.

628
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,220
We've found out that the police are looking for a way to find out who the suspect is.

629
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,220
They said he was a little bit too young.

630
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,220
Now, we can't tell him who the suspect is.

631
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,220
The evidence is also that he's not a suspect.

632
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,220
We're not in a hurry to find out who the suspect is.

633
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,220
We're in a hurry to find out who the suspect is.

634
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,220
If we find out who the suspect is, we'll have to find out who the suspect is.

635
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Now, we can't tell him who the suspect is.

636
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,220
He's a suspect.

637
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,220
Dad, I don't know who the suspect is.

638
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
You don't know who the suspect is.

639
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
What does he mean?

640
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,220
He's a suspect.

641
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
I'm not telling you.

642
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
He's a young man.

643
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,220
He's just a judge.

644
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,220
You're not telling me.

645
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,220
You're the main judge.

646
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,220
What are you talking about?

647
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,220
Dad, I'm going to kill you.

648
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,220
No, this is not my fault.

649
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,220
You're not my fault either.

650
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,220
What's your fault?

651
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,220
I'm asking you what's your fault.

652
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
Why did you throw the table?

653
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,220
Dad, we're just playing around.

654
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,220
What's your fault?

655
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,220
What's your fault?

656
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,220
You're not my fault either.

657
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
You're a bad judge.

658
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
You're a police officer.

659
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
What?

660
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
You're not a police officer.

661
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,220
We're a police officer.

662
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,220
Doctor.

663
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,220
We're going to kill you.

664
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,220
Doctor.

665
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
This is a police officer.

666
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,220
I'm sorry to have made you suffer.

667
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,220
We're both in a bad mood.

668
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,220
You should have liked Jiang Zheng.

669
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,220
You're all here.

670
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
I'm here.

671
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,220
I'm here.

672
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
I'm here.

673
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
You're not going out?

674
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
We're going to go out.

675
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,220
This is my witness.

676
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
You're not going out.

677
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,220
You're a judge.

678
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,220
Why are you so stubborn?

679
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,220
It's not like that.

680
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
The judge is not a good judge.

681
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,220
Some people are like me.

682
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,220
They say I'm a good judge.

683
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
They're not good at all.

684
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
You're a good judge.

685
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,220
You're a good judge.

686
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,220
You're a good judge.

687
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
You're a good judge.

688
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,220
You're a good judge.

689
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,220
You're a good judge.

690
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,220
I'm sorry.

691
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
I'm sorry.

692
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,220
I'm sorry.

693
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
I'm sorry.

694
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,220
I'm a good judge.

695
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
I'm a good judge.

696
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,220
But I have a problem with you.

697
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,220
I'm afraid of the police.

698
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,220
I know you're afraid of the police.

699
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,220
I'll go to your place and find a way.

700
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,220
I don't want to go.

701
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,220
Yes.

702
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
It's all my fault.

703
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,220
I'll go to your place and find a way to protect you.

704
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,220
I'll go to your place and find a way to protect you.

705
00:33:54,220 --> 00:34:15,220
computation

706
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
If the prosecutor or the police arrive at the crime scene,

707
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,220
the prosecutor AngelSU will get up and Rita A will get up.

708
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,220
If the prosecutor doesn't get up yet and Rita A doesn't,

709
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,220
I'm not going to sue you if you don't have enough evidence.

710
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,220
I'm going to sue you if you don't have enough evidence.

711
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,220
I've seen the victim being sued.

712
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,220
Because the situation is a secret affair.

713
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
Only you two know what happened.

714
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,220
So most of the cases are all talkative.

715
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,220
The whole process of the lawsuit,

716
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
except for the death of the person who was killed,

717
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,220
you have to face the police, the police, the law,

718
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,220
even more people.

719
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,220
You have many questions.

720
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,220
I'll ask you what clothes you wear.

721
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,220
What place does he start touching you from?

722
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
How many times?

723
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Do you have a relative? Do you have a snake head?

724
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,220
Do you have a rejection?

725
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,220
What kind of knowledge do you use to enter your body?

726
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Handprint or silver?

727
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,220
Is this a matter of...

728
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,220
I mean...

729
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,220
We have to find a way to get rid of that bastard,

730
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
but we'll get it right.

731
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,220
The truth of the lawsuit is the truth of the relative.

732
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,220
It's not the truth of the absolute.

733
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
We have to see the evidence.

734
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,220
We have to see what kind of police,

735
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,220
police, law and police you encounter.

736
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
There's always someone dissatisfied with the result.

737
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
Think about it.

738
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,220
Okay.

739
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,220
Anyway, we'll stay with you.

740
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Thank you.

741
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
You stay with him.

742
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,220
Think about it.

743
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,220
But you have to remind him.

744
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,220
The more you drag him, the more difficult it is to find him.

745
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,220
Okay. Thank you.

746
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,220
Hello.

747
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,220
Hello.

748
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
Mr. Xu, I have to tell you this.

749
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,220
I've told the lawyer that you can meet the child in two weeks.

750
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,220
But you have to follow the rules.

751
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,220
You have to send the child back before 5 p.m.

752
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,220
Okay?

753
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,220
Okay.

754
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
Okay.

755
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
I have something to tell you.

756
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
You should rest.

757
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,220
Okay.

758
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,220
Okay. Bye.

759
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
Okay. Bye.

760
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Mr. Xu, I have to tell you something.

761
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
I have to tell you something.

762
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,220
I have to tell you something.

763
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
I have to tell you something.

764
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220

765
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,220
I have to tell you something.

766
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
I have to tell you something.

767
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
I have to tell you something.

768
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
I have to tell you something.

769
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
I have to tell you something.

770
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,220
I have to tell you something.

771
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
I have to tell you something.

772
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
I have to tell you something.

773
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
I have to tell you something.

774
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
I have to tell you something.

775
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
I have to tell you something.

776
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,220
Okay.

777
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
Say that you didn't get a job?

778
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,220
Okay.

779
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
Okay.

780
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,220
Zhen Mi.

781
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,020
Zhen Mi.

782
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
Zhen Mi.

783
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Okay.

784
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,020
Okay, Zhen Mi.

785
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,020
Let him be with you.

786
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
Do you know what your mother said to him?

787
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Do you know what your mother said to him?

788
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,020
Zhen Mi.

789
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,020
He...

790
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
Zhen Mi.

791
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,020
Come, be careful.

792
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,020
What are you doing?

793
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,020
The champion is still so unscrupulous.

794
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,020
Why don't you have any sense at all?

795
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
I told you I'd take him to see a doctor.

796
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
You don't know what to do.

797
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
What about Guan Peng?

798
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Are they going to compete?

799
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,020
Is there something wrong with your company?

800
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,020
Why do you care about my company at this time?

801
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Take care of your family and your son.

802
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,020
I'm so worried.

803
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,020
Take care of your health.

804
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,020
Come, sit inside.

805
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,020
Get in.

806
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,020
Yes, I'll sit here.

807
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,020
Tell your mother to come with us.

808
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,020
Dad, ask if you want to go with us.

809
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,020
You remind him that he'll be back when the time is right.

810
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,020
Don't be late.

811
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,020
We're going to have dinner with auntie tonight.

812
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,020
Don't be late.

813
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,020
We have to come back at 5.

814
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,020
Take care.

815
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,020
You're welcome.

816
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,020
Your birthday present.

817
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,020
Please wait.

818
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,020
Thank you, dad.

819
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,020
Come on in.

820
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,020
Hello, Mr. Guan.

821
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,020
I'm so sorry for the trouble we're in.

822
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,020
Please take care of your health.

823
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Please tell me if you need anything.

824
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,020
We'll be back when the time is right.

825
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,020
Please take care of your health.

826
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,020
Please take care of your health.

827
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,020
Hello, Mr. Guan.

828
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,020

00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,020
Thank you.

833
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,020
Every one of you, take care.

00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,020
Thank you.

835
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
Thank you.

836
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,020
Okay, you can start now.

837
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,020
Please have the floor de celebrities in this program

838
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,020

839
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
No need toierung.

840
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:13,000
Subscribe to the channel now and

841
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,080
The members of IYWI Hold for what?

842
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,560
Wait a sec, somebody in the hat

843
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,920
We were asked to pick up our soldiers

844
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:33,240
We made the first pistol from our food

845
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,360
Okay

846
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,160
The Traffic Department wants to ski

847
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,680
But we can't かきたい

848
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,120
What's the most fundamental safety problem?

849
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,920
Take a look. Thank you.

850
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,160
Jingjing, I forgot to ask my friend.

851
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,400
I'm leaving.

852
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,200
Can you do it alone?

853
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,080
The blood of the people!

854
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,800
The blood of the people!

855
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,320
The blood of the people!

856
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,000
The blood of the people!

857
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,880
Hello.

858
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
The doctor said he has a long-term illness.

859
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
His mouth is full of water.

860
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,880
No wonder he can't eat.

861
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Okay, wait a minute.

862
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
Do you want to talk to your mom?

863
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
Yes.

864
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Come.

865
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
Mom, I'm eating ice cream.

866
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,880
No.

867
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,880
The doctor said he has a better appetite now.

868
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,880
Okay, I know.

869
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,880
I'll pick it up later.

870
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
Now.

871
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Okay.

872
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Okay.

873
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Okay.

874
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
I'll pick it up later.

875
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
Okay.

876
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Mom, look.

877
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
I'm getting taller too.

878
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
I'll pull it here.

879
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,880
It will change its direction.

880
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
Come on, Qi Zhe.

881
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
Turn around.

882
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
Turn around.

883
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Turn around.

884
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
Turn around.

885
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
Turn around.

886
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Turn around.

887
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
He wants to take you to heaven.

888
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,880
I'm going to hit the road again.

889
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
Good.

890
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
Be careful, you will hurt.

891
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Yeah.

892
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,880
Another take.

893
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,880
We will look after him.

894
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
That's great.

895
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Bye-bye.

896
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Let's go.

897
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,880
Are you not finished?

898
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,280
Yes,...

899
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,400
I'm going to be happy.

900
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,060
Yes, Mom.

901
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,540
Since Hongbright has so many visited old cities and villages,...

902
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,380
will she have more Children?

903
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,960
Sorry.

904
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,160
Looks as if they need a change of things.

905
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,240
That's a mix of the two 세's two.

906
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,520
This woman seems to not do anything expensive.

907
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,880
Very good.

908
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,880
It's been days

909
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,160
Are you really not going to sue me?

910
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,560
You've said it

911
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,360
The longer you take off, the weaker the evidence

912
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,880
If it's you, will you sue me?

913
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,080
I'll sue him to death, okay?

914
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,120
If it's me,

915
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,720
I'll sue you

916
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,760
I want this to be settled for two or three years

917
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Then I'll be able to sue you

918
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,760
I just want to recover my normal life

919
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,640
I won't answer his phone

920
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,440
MSN didn't reply my messages

921
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,440
If you hadn't taken him out today,

922
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,280
I wouldn't have known what he was hiding from me

923
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,560
Is this called recovering your normal life?

924
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Eat up. Eat something first

925
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,880
You said the car was broken

926
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,480
You even hit the car

927
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,880
Why did you choose to drive?

928
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,880
You always hit the road

929
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,880
I was too late

930
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
What are you saying?

931
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,880
You're taking the kids abroad

932
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,880
I won't let you see me again

933
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
Don't be angry

934
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,880
Let's talk about it again

935
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,880
What's the use of your air conditioner now?

936
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,880
That's right

937
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,880
It's all your fault

938
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,880
I said I was talking to you about the car

939
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,880
What's the use of it?

940
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,880
We came here today to look for a shop

941
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,880
There's no car to go

942
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,880
Why are you making a fuss?

943
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,880
It's for money

944
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,880
I told you

945
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,880
We opened a photo studio together

946
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,880
It's a future trend

947
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,880
Trend?

948
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,880
It's too late

949
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,880
The battery is running out

950
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,880
Who will take photos from now on?

951
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
You're making fun of me like a sister

952
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,880
You're not eating?

953
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
You little girl

954
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Your brother doesn't make sense

955
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,880
He doesn't have the ability

956
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,880
Not your responsibility

957
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,880
Nor mine

958
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,880
He's temperate and personality

959
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,880
It's better for kids to raise him

960
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,880
Be quiet

961
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,880
You're afraid he won't hear you

962
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,880
How can I raise him?

963
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,880
I'm a father

964
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,880
Let's eat

965
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,880
Sorry

966
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,880
I don't want to have anything to do with this

967
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,880
The money that A'Gong left me

968
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,880
Is for the higher-ups

969
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,880
It's...

970
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,880
The high-class

971
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,880
What do you mean?

972
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,880
The high-class

973
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,880
I'm sorry

974
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
I don't want to have anything to do with this

975
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,880
A'Gong left me this money

976
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,880
I'll give you my thanks

977
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,380
Enjoy the coffee

978
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,700
Watch out

979
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,400
I'll rain something

980
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,560
Here you go

981
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,880
Wait a minute

982
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,240
Sister

983
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,720
ate

984
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,560
I'm not here

985
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,560
Someone left the old wine

986
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:46,560
You are looking for the best arrangement for fate

987
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:55,560
But I'm always too desperate

988
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,560
Forget about the endless life

989
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:07,560
How many sad hearts are broken by time

990
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:16,560
How many regrets are left to be separated

991
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,560
You are not afraid of being too happy

992
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:31,560
How many memories are left to be separated

993
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:38,560
How many dark memories are left to be separated

994
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:46,560
How many courage is left to the future

995
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:55,560
I'm not afraid of being apart

996
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,560
Time is not up to date

997
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,560
How is it?

998
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,560
I'm so happy

999
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,560
I want you to be happy

1000
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,560
You are a doctor

1001
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,560
You are a doctor

1002
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,560
You are a doctor

1003
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,560
You are a doctor

1004
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,560

1005
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
You are a doctor

1006
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,560
You are a doctor

1007
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Yixing

1008
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,560
I'm good

1009
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,800
sincerely

1010
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,520
If you love me,

1011
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,120
you'll love me

1012
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,040
Therefore,

1013
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,420
now I have mine

1014
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,840
Don't cry
