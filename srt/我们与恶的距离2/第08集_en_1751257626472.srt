1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I think this time

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Qing Yun won the election very much.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Young people usually can't stand

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Liu Xingchun and Liu Hoshan's family.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If you really want to reform,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
take this opportunity.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The public party needs you.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But the topics I usually focus on

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
are some environmental protection,

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
sustainable development, human rights.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I also face a lot of

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
big corporations and big enterprises

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in the case of my company.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think the most important thing

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is to fight against big corporations and big enterprises.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Do you think I'm okay with this?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I will support you no matter what you do.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because I believe you will stick to your beliefs.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Endless support.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You are so annoying.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's no use asking you.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Qingqing, what do you think?

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Why are you asking me?

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
She has already decided, okay?

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
She just walked through the process

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to ask us for a fake respect.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Bullshit.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I really want to hear your opinion, okay?

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What does it have to do with the marriage of the two gays?

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You should have someone to walk with you in the field.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You are not the kind of person

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
who would be like a man

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
with a head on his back.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If I go to the head on my back,

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
will we be caught in the eyes?

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Is the judgment very good?

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Or are you going to the Ministry of Department of Justice?

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You call the five-man group

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to put you in the front line.

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't talk about it.

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He is not the one who is in charge of our high-ranking people.

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's okay for the high-ranking people to come by themselves.

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But if we add our public party,

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
it's a double insurance.

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes.

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The public party is now

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
just going to make a fire.

48
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's not a fire.

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's a bomb.

50
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When you are elected,

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you can be a direct supervisor

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to the railway.

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But politicians

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
all have wives wearing the back-up shirt

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
to sweep the floor.

56
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It seems that the judge is not suitable for the marriage of the two gays.

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Gao Zheng Guang,

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
if you need someone to walk with you

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and sweep the floor,

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
you can go to someone else now.

61
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I really won't get in the way.

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Please.

63
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are the judge.

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am the one who is in charge of the high-ranking people.

65
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't ask people to come to me.

66
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I beg you.

67
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I can't let someone

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
who is in charge of the high-ranking people

69
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to sweep the floor.

70
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If that girl is still a girl,

71
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
if you let her go out and sweep the floor,

72
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you will be in trouble.

73
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You should be a good NGO

74
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and supervise the government.

75
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Then you can start a business.

76
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay?

77
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I want to enter the system

78
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and see how they change from the inside.

79
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

80
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you think I will take the initiative?

81
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will take the initiative.

82
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But I have a condition.

83
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What condition?

84
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You have to take care of the house,

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the house, the house,

86
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the land and the property.

87
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You have to take care of them.

88
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have another task.

89
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I will ask the director to give me the money.

90
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Xiaoya,

91
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
are you going to be a director?

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I have about three hundred thousand

93
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and a half million in my bank account.

94
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I just want to take your money.

95
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You are so smart.

96
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The most important thing now

97
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
is that you have just finished the treatment.

98
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You have to take good care of your body

99
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and use it well.

100
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If I don't have time,

101
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't think I have time to talk to you.

102
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I have been thinking about this child for so long.

103
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I can't.

104
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't do this.

105
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The situation has been made.

106
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The constitution is respected.

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The country is loyal.

108
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It represents the people's right to act according to the law.

109
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go away.

110
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hurry up.

111
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hurry up.

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Go away!

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Go away!

114
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,720
The law of the two-line line is passed.

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,680
The country of the two-line line

116
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,240
represents the people,

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
and follows the law to uphold the right to power.

118
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
Do not seek private property.

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,920
Do not seek private interests.

120
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,080
Do not be bribed.

121
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,200
Do not interfere with the law of the private.

122
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,920
As the vow,

123
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,080
I am willing to be punished severely.

124
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,360
The warning,

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,640
the declaration,

126
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,120
Gao Zhenguang,

127
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,680
February 1, 109,

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,240
the Republic of China.

129
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,920
The Law of the Two-line Line

130
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Episode 11

131
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,280
Sister Xianzhu,

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,080
everyone misses you.

133
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,320
When will you come back?

134
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,040
You can't even

135
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,600
rely on me when you're not here.

136
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,200
I haven't seen you for three months.

137
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm retiring.

138
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,840
Director,

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,160
you're retiring?

140
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120
You've been holding on for so long

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,200
just to get a job.

142
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,720
If you retire now,

143
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
you won't get a single cent.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,160
I told her that too.

145
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,160
You haven't got a job for years.

146
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't know why I need a job now.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Why do I need to be a public servant?

148
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
It's meaningless.

149
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,120
Sister Xianzhu,

150
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,160
I know you're still blaming yourself.

151
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,560
But Luo Zhiqiang and Meizhi's sister

152
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,760
are not your responsibility.

153
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,360
It's already happened.

154
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,560
The living are more important now.

155
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,160
You can go and see them.

156
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Youming is afraid that she'll drag me down

157
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,760
and doesn't want to be involved with me.

158
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,960
But when she needs me the most,

159
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,560
I can't help her.

160
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,960
How can I face them?

161
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,480
Let's call her sister and act like we received black money.

162
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,720
Let's see if she can

163
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,120
give me my eye drops that I can't concentrate during the shooting.

164
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
There he is.

165
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,560
So?

166
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
So what?

167
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,320
That boss's going a get beaten up.

168
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
You're a primary school student?

169
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,880
I've been waiting for you for so long.

170
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,600
What?

171
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,840
You don't dare?

172
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,760
Go and tell the teacher.

173
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,120
Okay.

174
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Come on.

175
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,240
The teacher is in front.

176
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
In front.

177
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Beat him to death.

178
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,080
Beat him.

179
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,600
Beat him.

180
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,920
Beat him to death.

181
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,240
Liang Zetong, what are you doing?

182
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
Beat him to death.

183
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,040
Don't.

184
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,600
Don't.

185
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,560
Don't.

186
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Let go.

187
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Liang Zetong.

188
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,320
Let go.

189
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Calm down.

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Let go.

191
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Okay.

192
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Are you okay?

193
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Don't say that.

194
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Don't say that.

195
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Are you okay?

196
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Liang Zetong.

197
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Okay.

198
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Okay.

199
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Let go.

200
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Okay.

201
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Are you okay?

202
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
I know you've been

203
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
very, very sad these days.

204
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Can you tell the teacher

205
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
what you're thinking now?

206
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Okay.

207
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
I'll ask the director to tell the parents.

208
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Don't.

209
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
You must tell the parents

210
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
from the school's point of view.

211
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
What do you hope the teacher will do?

212
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Luo Yu.

213
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
I've already beaten him.

214
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Don't let my mom know.

215
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
So you mean

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
you don't want your mom

217
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
to know you've been beaten

218
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
and worry about you.

219
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
You don't want your mom

220
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
to know you've been beaten

221
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
and worry about you.

222
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
You don't want your mom

223
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
to know you've been beaten

224
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
and worry about you.

225
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
You don't want to let

226
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Zheng Tu be punished.

227
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
I've been there.

228
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
I'm not bad.

229
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Then why don't you

230
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
let grandpa know?

231
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Are you afraid he'll be sad?

232
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
He's not in good health.

233
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Okay.

234
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
I can promise you

235
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
not to tell grandpa about this.

236
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
But think about it.

237
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
If grandpa were here,

238
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
he wouldn't have been so sad.

239
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Don't let dad be embarrassed.

240
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Then why?

241
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Why don't they

242
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
take good care of the psycho?

243
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Why do they

244
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
run around like psycho?

245
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Are you going to take the bus?

246
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Do you want to take the bus?

247
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Do you want to take the bus?

248
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
How much is the bus to Wu Jiao Chuo?

249
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
It's 350.

250
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
The bus is in front.

251
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
You have to walk for a while.

252
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Hello.

253
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Oh, no.

254
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Sorry.

255
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
I have something to do.

256
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
There's a bus over there.

257
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
I'll go to the bus stop.

258
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Okay.

259
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
I've promised

260
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
not to bother you anymore.

261
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
I want to talk to you.

262
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
If you meet a similar situation,

263
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
how will you handle it?

264
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm not in a good mood.

265
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,840
I can't even

266
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
talk to other people.

267
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
I can go back

268
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
if I'm in a bad mood.

269
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
It doesn't sound

270
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
like a good option.

271
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Do you have a better choice?

272
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Life has a lot of

273
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
unsatisfactory things.

274
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
But the first time

275
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
I got in touch with you,

276
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
I knew you were

277
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
the most important person

278
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
in my life.

279
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
But now,

280
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
the most important thing

281
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
is to study hard

282
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
so that you can change.

283
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Do you know that?

284
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
It's easy.

285
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Dad is crazy.

286
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Your dad will kill someone.

287
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Everyone in the world

288
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
wants our family to die.

289
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
I can't know

290
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
everyone's thoughts.

291
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
But I have a chance.

292
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
I hope you and your family

293
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
know that

294
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
it's not your fault.

295
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
It's not something you can control.

296
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
If someone bullies you,

297
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
you must come to me.

298
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
I can go to the police

299
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
or whatever.

300
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
But I just want to tell you

301
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
that it's not your fault.

302
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Don't be embarrassed at school.

305
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
I just want to be the air.

306
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Can you do that?

307
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
I'm embarrassed?

308
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
I went to the school

309
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
to help you get the right to teach me.

310
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
You've been practicing for so long.

311
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Now you suddenly

312
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
want to quit the talent show.

313
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Isn't that a pity?

314
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Because no one

315
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
wants to talk to me.

316
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
Who doesn't want to talk to you?

317
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Tell me.

318
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
I'm going to school tomorrow.

319
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
The whole class

320
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
doesn't want to talk to me.

321
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
You're playing video games

322
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
after school?

323
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Have you finished your homework?

324
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Why is your clothes so dirty?

325
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I fell.

326
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
If you two

327
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
are bullied at school,

328
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
tell me.

329
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Who is it?

330
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Who is it?

331
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Who is it?

332
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Who is it?

333
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Who is it?

334
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Who is it?

335
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
I'll go after them now.

336
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
What do you want?

337
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't mind me.

338
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Mind yourself.

339
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
It's been 20 years.

340
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
I didn't expect that

341
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
I would cry

342
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
in front of my students.

343
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
It's embarrassing.

344
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
It's not embarrassing.

345
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
Cry if you want to.

346
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Every emotion

347
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:25,580
should have a

348
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,580
I really want to tell

349
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
those two kids that

350
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
the world will get better.

351
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
But I don't know

352
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
how long I can be with them.

353
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
Who can guarantee

354
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
that the world will get better?

355
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Maybe because of

356
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
this sentence,

357
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
you've been with them

358
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
for the rest of your life.

359
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
I just hope

360
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
that the world can be gentle

361
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,580
to everyone in it.

362
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
You're great.

363
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
Really.

364
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
You can comfort

365
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,580
two injured kids at the same time.

366
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,580
You've done a great job.

367
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
I'm a family

368
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,580
who can only move in

369
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,580
with the family of the victim.

370
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
You're really

371
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,580
I'm embarrassed.

372
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,580
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,580
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,580
Well.

375
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,580
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,580
I didn't mean to do that.

377
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,580
Otherwise, I...

378
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
What's wrong?

379
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,580
It's okay.

380
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,580
I'll leave my phone

381
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,580
for you.

382
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,580
No need.

383
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,580
It's okay.

384
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,580
You're drawing a serious picture.

385
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,580
I'm really sorry.

386
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,580
I'm really sorry.

387
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm really sorry.

388
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,580
I'm really sorry.

389
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,580
I'm really sorry.

390
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,580
I'm really sorry.

391
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,580
I'm really sorry.

392
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,580
I'm sorry.

393
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
But I...

394
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,580
It's okay. You can go back to your work.

395
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,580
I'm sorry.

396
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,580
I'm sorry.

397
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
I've checked it.

398
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,580
The number

399
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,580
set in 2017

400
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
is 81940.

401
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,580
It was the speech

402
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,580
of the Party of Communists.

403
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
Now, the discussion

404
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,580
between the sharing and the forum

405
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,580
looks like the Communist Party's net army.

406
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,580
Although Chen Qingwen

407
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
is not a supporter now,

408
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,580
he's basically being scolded.

409
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,580
I'll talk to you later.

410
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Bye.

411
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,580
You're really a man.

412
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,580
But you're a woman.

413
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,580
Some people are happy,

414
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,580
some are not.

415
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
It's like being a lawyer.

416
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,580
No one is satisfied.

417
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,580
It's a good relationship.

418
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
I don't know if someone is satisfied

419
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,580
or not.

420
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580
The problem is...

421
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
The problem is the person

422
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,580
who is the one who is the one who is the one.

423
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,580
All the problems are the same.

424
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,580
The most important is to protect the people.

425
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Every place is a chance.

426
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,580
The same goes for the stage.

427
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,580
Let me tell you.

428
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
The number of people who are now

429
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,580
losing their jobs

430
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,580
is already increasing.

431
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
The number of people who are losing their jobs

432
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
is already increasing.

433
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,580
Losing what?

434
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
How do you know?

435
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
I know the number of people

436
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,580
who are losing their jobs.

437
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
You're just talking to people.

438
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,580
The rich are being attacked.

439
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
The world is being destroyed.

440
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
Moreover,

441
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,580
Lin Guoying and the government

442
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
have been cooperating for a long time.

443
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,580
They're just saying that

444
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,580
you're the top three in the country.

445
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
But you're still trying to get the government to stop the government.

446
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,580
I'm thinking that

447
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
the government should just

448
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
give up.

449
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,580
The government has just

450
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
given up.

451
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,580
The tax havens are getting lower.

452
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,580
The people should be able to

453
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
get a share.

454
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,580
The people who are losing their jobs

455
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
are the ones who are losing their jobs.

456
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,580
If you don't give them the benefits

457
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,580
in 30 years,

458
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
they'll say you're a fraud.

459
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
Now there are people

460
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
saying that you're having

461
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
a relationship with a man and a woman.

462
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,580
What relationship?

463
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,580
I told you not to

464
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
bring up the sex drive.

465
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,580
You didn't listen.

466
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,580
The tax havens have been

467
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
fraud for 30 years.

468
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
The government is not

469
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,580
doing things in a relaxed manner.

470
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,580
The people don't care at all.

471
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,580
What's going on now?

472
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,580
Are you going to start working for the government?

473
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,580
What about your interests?

474
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
What about your solutions?

475
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,580
Are you going to work for the government?

476
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
The people's lives

477
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
have been in the bottom of the pit for 60 years.

478
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,580
How are you going to deal with them?

479
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,580
I'm going to work for the government.

480
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,580
I'm going to work for the government.

481
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
The people's lives

482
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,580
are in the bottom of the pit.

483
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
If the people's lives are in the bottom of the pit,

484
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,580
they won't have time to be a gentleman.

485
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,580
You're right.

486
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
The government is a gentleman.

487
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
Look at you.

488
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,580
You're not doing

489
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
this kind of thing.

490
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,580
This is a reality.

491
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
You should be more serious about it.

492
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,580
Okay?

493
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580
You're so stubborn.

494
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
If you were a man,

495
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,580
you'd be very smart

496
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,580
if you were to say that.

497
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
If you weren't related to him in the first place,

498
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,580
you'd have been Shadowed.

499
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Since there's an histories on him,

500
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,580
he'll be the finalף.

501
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,580
We can allow him to be.

502
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,580
Okay, why not do it yourself?

503
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:53,980
You two can serve him

504
00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:07,820
and give him Da Yin

505
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,740
instead of myself.

506
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,580
Good on you.

507
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,580
I'll think of something else.

508
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Is there any way?

509
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,580
If you don't show up today,

510
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,580
I'll have to get caught by the police.

511
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,580
What are you talking about?

512
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,580
I'm telling you.

513
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,580
The boss of the legal department has already cancelled the lawsuit.

514
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,580
If you don't show up,

515
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
how long will you be able to live?

516
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
I think it's better to eat.

517
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,580
It's better to eat.

518
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,580
It's better to eat.

519
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,580
It's better to be a man.

520
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,580
I'm a patient who is sick in the epidemic.

521
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
His neighbor actually chose to be beaten

522
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,580
to force him to send a doctor.

523
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Now the situation is more stable.

524
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,580
The police dare not let him out.

525
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
He will be locked up in the so-called

526
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
30 billion dollars room.

527
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
That's weird.

528
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
A Luo Zhi Xiang case

529
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,580
that seems to be the case of all the patients in the world.

530
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
He's not allowed to be released, is he?

531
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,580
Yes.

532
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
The people are really scared.

533
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
The people are scared?

534
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,580
The people are scared, so they have to teach them.

535
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,580
You care about human rights.

536
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,580
You'd rather be a scientist

537
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,580
than be in prison

538
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,580
and not be used in the community.

539
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,580
And then you throw people

540
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,580
into the work of our busy key guards

541
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
and the official visitors.

542
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Hey,

543
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,580
isn't that too obvious?

544
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,580
The situation was very special

545
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
during the epidemic.

546
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
People were very worried.

547
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,580
Even if there is no epidemic,

548
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
is there enough space?

549
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,580
Not enough space.

550
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,580
The money is not in place.

551
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
Anyway,

552
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
it's always the first step.

553
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,580
Then we can take it slowly.

554
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,580
Wow, you spent 15 years

555
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,580
to take one step to fix it.

556
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,580
You can be fast this time, brother.

557
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
No, what's wrong with you today?

558
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
What's wrong?

559
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
Are you taking the explosive?

560
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
It's not easy for me

561
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
to do the main investigation.

562
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,580
I just called to ask you for advice.

563
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,580
You keep calling me.

564
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,580
I may be too busy recently.

565
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
Sorry.

566
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
What you just said,

567
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,580
I'll give you a copy

568
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
after I finish reading it, okay?

569
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
Are you still in Taipei?

570
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
Good luck.

571
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Thank you for

572
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
putting the mental health law

573
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
in your heart.

574
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,580
Okay, I'll go first. Bye.

575
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,580
You really like ice cream.

576
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,580
The landlord is urging us to pay the rent.

577
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,580
We didn't pay last month.

578
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
I'm not giving you five thousand.

579
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
You have to pay for a month first.

580
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,580
I wanted to.

581
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,580
But my mom came to me.

582
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
She said I was in a hurry.

583
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,580
She asked me to give her money.

584
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Why didn't you tell me?

585
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
My sister said that

586
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
there was a shortage of people in her store.

587
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,580
I thought I...

588
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,580
I need to wash my hair.

589
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
Look.

590
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
Your hand is not recovered yet.

591
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
You can't go there.

592
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
You can just find a job.

593
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,580
What job do you want?

594
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
My waist is already recovered.

595
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,580
You are sick.

596
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,580
I'll wait for her at the school gate.

597
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
I'll ask her not to come for dinner.

598
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,580
Do you know her?

599
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
You've gotten thinner.

600
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
No, I'm not.

601
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,580
You are too thin.

602
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,580
Xing Zui,

603
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,580
why haven't you come to see me for so long?

604
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,580
You two have lost weight.

605
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,580
You need to get some weight.

606
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
You need to get some weight.

607
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,580
What do you want to eat?

608
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,580
Braised pork.

609
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,580
Okay, I'll be right there.

610
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
I'm sorry.

611
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,580
Mom, look.

612
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
This is the letter that Xing Zui gave me.

613
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,580
No, give it back to her.

614
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
No.

615
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
Xing Zui,

616
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,580
don't give her such an expensive thing.

617
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
It's okay.

618
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
This is an old one.

619
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,580
My old hair is getting worse.

620
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,580
Just give it to her.

621
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,580
It's easier for us to contact each other.

622
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,580
You haven't eaten yet?

623
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,580
I didn't bring the braised pork and chicken soup.

624
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,580
I'll get you some.

625
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,580
Where's Gege?

626
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,580
I don't know.

627
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,580
She comes home so late every day.

628
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Only recently.

629
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,580
She was also quarreling with mom at home.

630
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,580
Why did you buy so much?

631
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,580
I was thinking that

632
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,580
we haven't had dinner together for a long time.

633
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,580
The food stall is on special leave.

634
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
I told Wen Cheng to buy some.

635
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
We can...

636
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,580
Don't be like this, okay?

637
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,580
It seems that I won't have children.

638
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Did I make them hungry?

639
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,580
We just want to say

640
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,580
that we won't go to see Luo Yun.

641
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Otherwise, he'll be outside.

642
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,580
Yu Ming.

643
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,580
We're moving.

644
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
We won't bother you anymore.

645
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,580
Xing Zui.

646
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
Did my mom say that you're moving?

647
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,580
She always says that.

648
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
But we don't know where to move.

649
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Come on.

650
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
Here we are.

651
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
Is Luo Yun here?

652
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Yes.

653
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
We're in the sand pit.

654
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
We're here to make some profit.

655
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
You don't need to study, do you?

656
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
Why do you need to make profit?

657
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,580
Go back with me.

658
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,580
Go back with me when you're done.

659
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,580
What are you looking at?

660
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,580
Luo Yun, go.

661
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,580
Go.

662
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,580
Don't be like this.

663
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
I'll be sad if something happens to Zhi Qiang.

664
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,580
Let him come again.

665
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
I'll go to the store.

666
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Luo Yun.

667
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Go home with your mom.

668
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,580
I'm leaving.

669
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,580
Hurry up.

670
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,580
What are you doing?

671
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,580
Don't make your mom angry.

672
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,580
Listen to me.

673
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,580
Go.

674
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Go.

675
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
I'm leaving.

676
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,580
Go.

677
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,580
Go.

678
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,580
Go.

679
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,580
Go.

680
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
Go.

681
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
Go.

682
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,580
Go.

683
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,580
Go.

684
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
Go.

685
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
Go.

686
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,580
Go.

687
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,580
Go.

688
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,580
Yi He and Zhi Qiang.

689
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
You have to go back with me,

690
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,580
and wait for me.

691
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Go now.

692
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,580
Go.

693
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,580
Go.

694
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,580
Go.

695
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,580
Go.

696
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,580
Go.

697
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
Go.

698
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,580
Go.

699
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,580
Go.

700
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,580
Go.

701
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,580
Go.

702
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,340
You're looking for me tomorrow? I'll wait for you.

703
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,940
What's the matter? Tell me tomorrow.

704
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,540
You're going to treat me like a fool.

705
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,060
Taking medicine is just to stabilize your own emotions.

706
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,300
It won't lower your IQ, okay?

707
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,860
Did you change anything by being impulsive before?

708
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,940
Okay, I'll just take it.

709
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,500
I'm almost out of money to eat.

710
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
I'm sorry.

711
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
That's all?

712
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,100
As long as I'm still in this hospital,

713
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,660
before you start working,

714
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,740
come find me.

715
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,820
I can treat you to dinner anytime.

716
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
I don't need any money.

717
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,220
Be stable and have emotions.

718
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,220
Work hard.

719
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,820
You won't have to rely on anyone in the future.

720
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,340
Dr. Wang,

721
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,340
are you in contact with the doctor?

722
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,540
We'll drink together next time.

723
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,540
We'll...

724
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,220
call each other.

725
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
You're looking for me?

726
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
Okay.

727
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
Okay.

728
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,020
Remember to turn it off. I'll wait for you.

729
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
Deputy Chief Mao,

730
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,380
we have several committee members here

731
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,820
who hope to increase the mental crisis

732
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,820
and the early intervention measures.

733
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,820
Don't wait until you have a self-harm or injury

734
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,220
before you can start the treatment.

735
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,820
I'd like to know what the problem is.

736
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,220
I'd like to report to the committee members.

737
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,420
Our early intervention plan

738
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,820
was established through case management.

739
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,820
Once a case is in crisis,

740
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,220
the hospital will have a group to handle it.

741
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,820
When you were on the 3rd level of police,

742
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,820
the case of Luo Xin's murder of a police officer,

743
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,220
did you intervene?

744
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,420
Another one is also a public opinion.

745
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,500
I've seen the

746
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
post-murder cases in the system.

747
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
Did anyone intervene?

748
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Of course.

749
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
We also agree that

750
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
someone intervened in the early stages.

751
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
At present,

752
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
we have no human resources.

753
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
So you can't handle it now?

754
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
You don't want to be in court?

755
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Do you want to wait until a more serious

756
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
and bigger social case

757
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,500
is solved after the social security network is broken?

758
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Of course not.

759
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,500
All our colleagues...

760
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
You keep mentioning community support.

761
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
What is community support?

762
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
I don't know.

763
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,580
The phone call staff is not trained enough.

764
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,580
The punishment is not clear.

765
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,580
We have to wait until the law is enforced.

766
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,580
Last time I asked,

767
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,580
they said there was no one.

768
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
This time I asked,

769
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,580
they said there was no money.

770
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
I want to know what it means now.

771
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,580
All our colleagues

772
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,580
are also working hard to study.

773
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
We will soon have a

774
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,580
better bill

775
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,580
for you to refer to.

776
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,580
Don't be so strong.

777
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,580
It's hard to be a Chinese official.

778
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Besides Zhou Mingcheng,

779
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,660
we still need other committee members to support us.

780
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
So...

781
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Isn't he Chen Qingtong's man?

782
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
He is going to be a drug dealer.

783
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,660
Mingcheng talked to me before.

784
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
We are the same.

785
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,660
Are you sure?

786
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,660
You have your own way.

787
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,660
You go back first.

788
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,660
I'll call you later.

789
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
It's Secretary Liu.

790
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,660
Okay, no problem.

791
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,660
I'll go now.

792
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,660
I didn't expect a local regional committee

793
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,660
would be so concerned about

794
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
the mental health law.

795
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
This is my job.

796
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,660
But don't forget

797
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,660
you represent the local people.

798
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,660
Your focus must be on

799
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
the local people

800
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
and the construction of the local people.

801
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,660
I thought

802
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660
the legislative committee

803
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
was always looking for me.

804
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,660
If you are dismissed,

805
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
do you think I still have

806
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,660
the space to speak

807
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,660
in the public party?

808
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
So please

809
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
take good care of your election.

810
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,740
The party has high expectations of you.

811
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,740
High expectations?

812
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,740
So

813
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,740
the netizens

814
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,740
are attacking me?

815
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,740
Netizens?

816
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,740
They are not in control.

817
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,740
Moreover,

818
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,740
it's very likely

819
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,740
that the enemy's camp

820
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,740
is spending money

821
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,740
to find public relations companies

822
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,740
to operate the city

823
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,740
and our own internal support.

824
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,740
Listen to the teacher's advice.

825
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,740
You have to use your strength

826
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
in the right place.

827
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,820
Otherwise, you will be eliminated soon.

828
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
The right place

829
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,820
is worth my place to choose.

830
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,820
And

831
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
please be a man

832
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,820
and be flexible.

833
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Politics is to manage the knowledge of the public

834
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
and not to do

835
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,820
what you want to do all the time.

836
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,820
Okay?

837
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,820
What are the standards of flexibility?

838
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,820
The election method is 26 boards.

839
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
The number of votes is 16.

840
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,820
The number of votes is 16.

841
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,820
The number of votes is 16.

842
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,820
The number of votes is 16.

843
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Maybe,

844
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
more than 10 days

845
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,820
if the judgement is to re-elect

846
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,820
those who are not allowed to become members

847
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:15,900
and justด你們

848
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,800
If the judgement is to re-elect

849
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,080
those who are not allowed to become members

850
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,780
and who are or have anHigh P道

851
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:19,820
some high- самойGrations

852
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,660
some high-

853
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
Who are those rich people

854
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
who are under-the-counter

855
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,760
becoming members?

856
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Just a series of situations

857
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,780
that I always ask about

858
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,820
really hurt my heart.

859
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,780
So

860
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,220
to sell accounts

861
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,180
and directly violate the criminal law

862
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,740
and never be allowed to participate in the election

863
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,460
The constitution clearly guarantees

864
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,740
that the people have the right to participate in the election

865
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,980
How could this be

866
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,460
a question of flexibility?

867
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,460
This is the basic principle

868
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,780
Do you think the voters will care about these?

869
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,820
Do you think there are a few people

870
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,940
who have the patience to understand these?

871
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,780
I tell you what the voters care about

872
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,980
At this moment, they only care about one thing

873
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,740
That is whether the party is willing to

874
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,940
clear the boundary by a black gold

875
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,900
According to the party's

876
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,860
regulation, does this bill pass?

877
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,740
Does it make sense?

878
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,940
Yes

879
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,420
Good

880
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:09,860
Good

881
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,260
If it makes sense, then vote

882
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,540
Now vote for the party's

883
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,380
regulation

884
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,620
The party's

885
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,740
requires the people to vote

886
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,660
The people's vote time is one minute

887
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,660
Start now

888
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,980
So we are doing this

889
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,340
to meet the public opinion

890
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,940
and to make a profit

891
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,900
Do you really think

892
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,180
that this will make the country more...

893
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,140
I don't want to talk to you about

894
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,100
the big picture

895
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
But think about it carefully

896
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,180
Do you really want those

897
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,420
gunmen, drug dealers, drug dealers

898
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,540
to participate in the election?

899
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,100
Please believe

900
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,900
that the party is willing to reform

901
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,100
But reform

902
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,460
cannot be done in one step

903
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,580
You have to have the right

904
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,780
to change it slowly

905
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,540
What you mean is

906
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,540
You want me to be a good

907
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,740
public figure like Captain Pei

908
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,220
I mean

909
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,940
Please take care of your own votes

910
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,940
You have offended

911
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,220
the party

912
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,660
How will the party listen to you?

913
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
Come on

914
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,540
Come on

915
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,540
Come on

916
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,540
Come on

917
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,340
OK

918
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,820
The result

919
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,500
76 people participated

920
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,620
45 approved

921
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,860
26 opposed

922
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,180
5 rejected

923
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,780
Most approved

924
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,260
The following announcement

925
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,180
The public official

926
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,860
The public official

927
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,660
has to sign the 26th bill

928
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,460
According to the regulation of the party

929
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
The motion is passed

930
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,860
The vote is passed

931
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,860
The vote is passed

932
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,860
Come on

933
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,860
Hello

934
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,860
Can I sleep in the bathroom?

935
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,060
This is just a normal member

936
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,540
The network of members

937
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,660
Nothing special

938
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,420
You sleep so little

939
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,660
You didn't even press the button

940
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,660
I didn't see

941
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,580
Mingcheng was scolded by the internet army

942
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,260
He was suspended and was punished

943
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,860
I just told Gao Zhenguang

944
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,660
I don't believe you

945
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,420
A law-abiding person

946
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,460
Will take over this bill

947
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,660
Do you know how he reprimanded me?

948
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,860
This is not as simple

949
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,700
as you think

950
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,100
You haven't been reprimanded

951
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,860
He hasn't taken a shower

952
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
It doesn't matter if he doesn't take a shower

953
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,060
He reprimanded you too

954
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
I even gave him a hard time

955
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
His mental health

956
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
is not good

957
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,100
I don't know him anymore

958
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Who do you know?

959
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,060
Gao Zhenguang

960
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,340
You have to compromise

961
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,060
Right?

962
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,140
But the value and the limit can't be changed

963
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,980
It's late

964
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,100
He doesn't show up

965
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
And he doesn't reply to messages

966
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,740
I don't know Gao Zhenguang

967
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,140
Happy birthday to you

968
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,420
Happy birthday to you

969
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,020
Happy birthday to you

970
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,020
Happy birthday to you

971
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,420
Happy birthday to you

972
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,620
Happy birthday to you

973
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,820
I'm touched

974
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,220
I'm so happy to have a birthday party

975
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,220
Come and celebrate with me

976
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
Thank you

977
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,220
Come on

978
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,220
Thank you

979
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,220
Thank you

980
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,820
Do you think Zhenguang

981
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,820
has changed?

982
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,420
You have to change your mind when changing a seat

983
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,020
After I became the director

984
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,100
I didn't think it was only about the young people

985
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,100
But I think Zhenguang

986
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,100
is a person with a good idea

987
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,100
He won't change his mind if he wants to

988
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
Do you remember Hu Wanjun?

989
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,100
He has changed a lot

990
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
He was naive before

991
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
Now he is like a person who owes him everything

992
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
He called the police of his dad's company

993
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,180
and was sent to the hospital by the police

994
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,180
But he even fought with the police and the nurse

995
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
Every time I hear this

996
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,180
I feel so sad

997
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,180
If I could do something more

998
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
Would things be different?

999
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,180
You have to remember

1000
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,180
You can't help everyone

1001
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Anyway

1002
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
His music came to me

1003
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,180
He asked me to lend him money

1004
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
I told him

1005
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,180
He must take medicine to maintain his mood

1006
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,180
I also arranged a social work for him

1007
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,180
But you know what happened to him

1008
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
He was like a pigeon

1009
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,180
He really has no hope

1010
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,260
What's wrong with him?

1011
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,260
He is only

1012
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
Twenty... Twenty-six years old

1013
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,260
You said he is not old

1014
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,260
He is our beauty

1015
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,260
You are thin

1016
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,260
No

1017
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,260
Wait, I want to buy you a drink

1018
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,260
I want to buy you a drink

1019
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,260
Come on

1020
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
Let's have a drink

1021
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,260
I'm sorry for waiting for you

1022
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,260
Because you really have a lot of applicants

1023
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,260
Sister, here is your receipt

1024
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,260
OK

1025
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,260
Please help me write an information

1026
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,260
I will help you apply

1027
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,260
This way please

1028
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,260
Thank you

1029
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,260
Thank you

1030
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,340
Thank you

1031
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,340
I will leave it to you

1032
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,340
If you have any questions, ask him

1033
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,340
OK

1034
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,340
We still need some wine

1035
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,340
Wait a minute, he will come soon

1036
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,340
Hello

1037
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,340
Do you need to apply for a subsidy?

1038
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,340
I'm Gao Zhengguang

1039
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,340
The committee is not here today

1040
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,340
Can I help you?

1041
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,340
Sister Lin

1042
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,340
Why are you here today?

1043
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,340
I came to pick you up

1044
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,340
How are you?

1045
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
I'm fine

1046
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
OK

1047
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,420
I'm here to apply for a subsidy

1048
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,420
I'll give you a call

1049
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
We will go together

1050
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
Aunt

1051
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
Aunt

1052
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
I'm Gao Zhengming

1053
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,420
I don't want my son to be a good person

1054
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,500
I want to move out

1055
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
And I want to go to school

1056
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
I really don't have a way

1057
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,500
To find Gao Zhengguang

1058
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
These twenty years

1059
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,500
I really didn't think

1060
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,500
I would bother you

1061
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
You are like this now

1062
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,500
How can Zhengguang

1063
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Have a relationship with you?

1064
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
Please be with him

1065
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
I was going to kill myself

1066
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,500
I won't find him again

1067
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
I don't have time to tell you

1068
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
I don't have any money now

1069
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
I only have a few times

1070
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,500
To give Zhengguang

1071
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
To be a good person

1072
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,500
Don't look at the committee

1073
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
The money of the committee

1074
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
And his family

1075
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,500
The team is not enough

1076
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
What you see now

1077
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,500
I owe it to him

1078
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,500
It doesn't matter how you guys have been

1079
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,500
Grandpa gave me the money

1080
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
Otherwise, I will tell the reporters

1081
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
Luo Zhiqiang was forced by you

1082
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,580
You guys are crazy

1083
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,580
Why are you so stubborn now?

1084
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,580
100

1085
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,580
Don't come again

1086
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,580
Really?

1087
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,580
No

1088
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,580
I will open a press conference later

1089
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,580
To see what the reporters want to hear

1090
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,580
I will go

1091
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,580
Youmin

1092
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,580
Youmin

1093
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,580
Youmin

1094
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,580
Youmin

1095
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,580
I went back to the toilet

1096
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,580
Xuehui reminded me

1097
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,580
She said

1098
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,580
She hoped I could help

1099
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,580
People like my mom

1100
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,580
This is a small token of our gratitude

1101
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,580
Wenchen said

1102
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,580
The most important thing to move is money

1103
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,580
I didn't take good care of my child

1104
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,580
I didn't take good care of my mother-in-law and Zhiqiang

1105
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,580
I borrowed the money

1106
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,580
I want to pay the salary to Xing first

1107
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,580
This is not enough

1108
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,660
I know

1109
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,660
What about us?

1110
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,660
But you know

1111
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,660
Luo Yu was beaten at school

1112
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,660
I dare to tell

1113
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,660
No one wants to talk to him at school

1114
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,660
They will only be bullied if they stay here

1115
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,660
What should I do?

1116
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,660
What are you doing with the box?

1117
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,660
What?

1118
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,660
Calm down

1119
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,660
I want to burn those people

1120
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,660
Who don't let me see my mother

1121
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,660
Can you see your mother

1122
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,740
What do they have to do with you

1123
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,740
Get in the car

1124
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,740
Sunny

1125
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,740
Sunny is strange recently

1126
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,740
What is the way to the cave?

1127
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,740
Zhao Qin seems to have a situation

1128
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,740
I'm going to see him

1129
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,940
Then you remember to pick up the horse

1130
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,940
I know

1131
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,940
The horse is getting numb

1132
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,940
That girl

1133
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,940
I'll go to the supermarket to buy milk

1134
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,940
Don't buy milk

1135
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,940
Don't give her sugar secretly

1136
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,940
Ok

1137
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,940
I'm sorry

1138
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,940
I'm sorry

1139
