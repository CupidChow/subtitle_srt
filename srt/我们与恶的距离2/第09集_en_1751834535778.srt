00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Discussion

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:09,640
Deal

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,260
Meeting

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,320
Solo

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,640
I am also a senior official of the Penglai family

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,320
I have been following the Penglai Railway for 20 years

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,240
From last week to now

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,960
12 accidents have happened in total

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,760
Do we have to wait until there are people

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,520
who are really hurt by the attack

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,160
and are killed by the attack?

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,400
Don't wait until there is another tragedy

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,920
and we have to take care of it

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,320
Penglai Railway

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,320
Penglai Railway

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Penglai Railway

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,320
Penglai Railway

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
Attention, everyone

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
We have gathered the people to report

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
A 40-year-old woman and a man

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,320
who have been in the sea for several days

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Please stop the car

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
I will go to the room

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
If you need anything, just call me

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Okay, thank you

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Hello

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Yes

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Okay, I will go to tell her now

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Okay

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Wait a minute

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
You are still a friend

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
I want to give you a gift

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Luo Yun

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
You are dead

35
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,320
When you called me, I found your mother

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Really?

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
Now she is in the hospital

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Attention

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
I found my mother

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Really?

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
I will go to the hospital first

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Okay

43
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Remember to tell the teacher

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Okay

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Classmate, will you go to bed?

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Okay

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Give me

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Hello, Tan Xiang

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
How do you feel?

50
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm fine

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
When's the hotel 000 MYC

52
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm worried.

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Uncle and Uncle Doctor are here to accompany us.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
And Zhu Yi.

55
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,320
You have to get well soon.

56
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm preparing for the exam.

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
I have to teach Doctor and Uncle.

59
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Hey, Zhen Min.

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
It's me.

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Doctor.

62
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
When the light is out,

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
you'll be back soon.

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Don't worry.

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Don't cry.

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
I'll listen to you.

67
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
You've worked hard.

68
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

69
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Hey.

70
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
What did you want to eat last night?

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Steak.

72
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Where is he going with your kid?

73
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Xiao Fei, do you want to eat?

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Uncle Doctor,

77
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
you want to see that man?

78
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Go ahead.

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
If I go to see the bathroom,

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
why should I go?

81
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I want to ask him.

82
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Why?

83
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Then go.

84
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
I also want to ask Dad

85
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
why he's doing this.

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
What are you doing?

87
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Let me go.

88
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Drink. When will you be back?

90
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
You're still drunk.

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
You can talk to yourself after dinner.

92
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
I'll be back soon.

93
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Hao Liu, drive.

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm going home.

95
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Don't follow me.

96
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
I'll go with you.

97
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
What did you say?

98
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Don't follow me.

99
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Go in.

100
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
I'll go with you.

101
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
What did you say?

102
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Don't follow me. Go in.

103
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Go in.

104
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,320
After you finish taking a shower,

105
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,320
read the book and go to bed.

106
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Understand?

107
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I'll go with you.

109
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Go.

110
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

111
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I'll go with you.

112
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Go.

113
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

114
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
I'll go with you.

115
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

116
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

117
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

119
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

120
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

121
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,320
You haven't changed at all.

122
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,320
No matter if you've participated in the mental examination,

123
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,320
you can't escape death.

124
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
You're just a heartless...

125
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Why did you ask me to go to the bathroom?

126
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Why?

127
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,320
I was the one who sent you the message.

128
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
You told him you were looking for a job

129
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
and forgot to go to the clinic.

130
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
I told him.

131
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Why did you tell him so much

132
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
that he didn't even read it?

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
You got blocked?

134
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Damn it.

135
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
My dad and my brother are the same.

136
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
It's no big deal if he blocks me.

137
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Alright.

138
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
The manager is here.

139
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
You can go to work tomorrow.

140
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
I was too busy yesterday.

141
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
I forgot to tell you.

142
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
I have to go with you.

143
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Who doesn't want to work with me?

144
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Tell him to come out and talk.

145
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
You're so willing to do it.

146
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Go over there and find a lot of work opportunities.

147
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
You're playing this trick.

148
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
If you're not good enough,

149
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
you can ask me to do the big business.

150
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Don't make it hard on me.

151
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
I didn't know you had a fight with so many people.

152
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
They always push me to work.

153
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
I can't explain it clearly.

154
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
They even blame me.

155
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Work is originally a burden for everyone.

156
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
You said you have a backache and can't move heavy.

157
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
You can't explain the money.

158
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
What else do you want?

159
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
They are lazy.

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
They sleep and scold me in the community.

161
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
You don't care about them?

162
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Alright.

163
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Then don't work with these annoying people.

164
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Alright.

165
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
I have a lot of things to do.

166
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Please don't make a scene here.

167
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
What are you doing?

168
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
You've been here for half a year.

169
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
You're messing with us.

170
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
You want to play with me?

171
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Did you hear me?

172
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Come out!

173
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Don't shoot me!

174
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm calling the police.

175
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Call the police?

176
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I'm scared of you.

177
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
I'll burn this place down.

178
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Damn!

179
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
This is my house.

180
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Damn!

181
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
This is my house.

182
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
I'll kill you!

183
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
This is my house.

184
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
I'll kill you!

185
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Come out!

186
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Come out!

187
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
I'll kill you!

188
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll kill you!

189
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Damn!

190
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Damn!

191
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
It's this world that made me to see me.

192
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
You did it, not me.

193
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
You killed five people.

194
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
And now you tell me

195
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
that you have nothing to do with

196
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
these people's life.

197
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
It's all because of the people.

198
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
You killed five people.

199
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
You killed five people.

200
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
You killed five people.

201
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
How many people did you kill?

202
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm sorry for what I've done.

203
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
It's all because of our bad luck.

204
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
What are you talking about?

205
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Da Hao.

206
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
What did you see in the mirror?

207
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Director, you can't do this.

208
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Director.

209
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Director.

210
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
I don't want to be like you.

211
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Director.

212
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Please forgive me for being selfish.

213
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
I told you this because I hope that after Hu Guan Jun and you meet,

214
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
I'll be more willing to accept the spirit of signing.

215
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm sorry for causing you a mental shock.

216
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
You really believe that I won't hit him?

218
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
You're the only one who can make me feel sorry.

219
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I've told you many times.

221
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I'll say it again.

222
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
You don't have to be polite.

223
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
You'll always have your place here.

224
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Are you sure that Dr. Ma is here?

225
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Brother, ride slower.

226
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
You're fast. You're weak.

227
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
I can't ride it anymore.

228
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
You can't find him.

229
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
I can't ride it anymore.

230
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Hey.

231
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
What did I say?

232
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
What did I say?

233
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I asked you to wash up and sleep.

234
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Did you find him?

235
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Oh.

236
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Do you want to hit him?

237
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
What are you doing here?

238
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
I know that you can't ride it anymore.

239
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
So I'm here to help you.

240
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Hit him.

241
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
I love to exercise.

242
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Hit him.

243
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
I'll take you to exercise.

244
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Luo Wei, I'll take you.

245
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I can't ride it anymore.

246
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Luo Wei, you ride it yourself.

247
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
I'll take you.

248
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Look.

249
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
After the press conference, the trend has risen.

250
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Feng Xiang has changed.

251
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Some fans are saying that we are making a fuss.

252
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
But I think it's okay.

253
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Most of the fans of the public party

254
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
are talking about the equal rights

255
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
and the M2.

256
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
They don't react now.

257
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
What about the comments

258
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
and the books we talked about?

259
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
What can they do?

260
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
I'll take a look.

261
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
I remember.

262
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
But what if

263
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
I don't have a job?

264
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
What should I do?

265
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Let's go back and open a food store.

266
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Food store?

267
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
I always say

268
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
that I choose this path

269
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
because I accept it.

270
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
I know the reason

271
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
behind every decision you make.

272
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
So I don't regret doing this with you.

273
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Thank you.

274
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Let's go.

275
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Don't drink.

276
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
He won't come at this time.

277
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Let's go.

278
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Don't drink.

279
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
You are already being dismissed.

280
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
How dare you judge your party in public?

281
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
You are really a political figure.

282
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
What are you doing?

283
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Mr. Peng.

284
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Don't think

285
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
that public party is

286
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
not good enough for you.

287
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
You know me for 20 years.

288
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
You should know that I'm not that kind of person.

289
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
You can give me

290
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Peng Lai's final results.

291
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
You can also give it to the traffic department.

292
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
You can give it to the public party,

293
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
the civil union party, or any committee.

294
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
You can also give it to the media.

295
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Why do you choose to report yourself?

296
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Do you know that you are

297
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
a double-dealing evil to the public party?

298
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
You should know that

299
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
I will never compromise

300
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
on Peng Lai's matter.

301
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Oh my god.

302
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Gao Zheng Guang, you are the only one

303
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
who is the light of the political discussion.

304
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
You are a savior.

305
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
I don't want to listen to your words.

306
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
I don't want to see

307
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
things being ruined

308
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
because of me.

309
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
I don't want to have a long-term plan.

310
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
I don't want to be

311
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
bullied by my comrades

312
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
in the party every day.

313
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Instead of

314
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
being like this,

315
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
I feel like I'm being pushed back.

316
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
I don't want to be like this.

317
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I don't want to be like this.

318
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I don't want to be like this.

319
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
I don't want to be like this.

320
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
I don't want to be like this.

321
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
I don't want to be like this.

322
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
I don't want to be like this.

323
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
I don't want to be like this.

324
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
I don't want to be like this.

325
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
I don't want to be like this.

326
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
I don't want to be like this.

327
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I don't want to be like this.

328
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
I don't want to be like this.

329
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
I don't want to be like this.

330
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Let's go.

331
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
You clearly know

332
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,520
that the party is

333
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
on the path to reform.

334
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,740
But this path of democracy,

335
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,740
if we walk it, it will be

336
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
it will be slow.

337
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
Because there are too many people

338
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,740
too many things

339
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
You need to slowly

340
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,340
You can't cooperate with the pain.

341
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,820
You have to be eliminated

342
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,100
from the starting point.

343
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,940
Don't make it hard for yourself.

344
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,300
It's not about pleasure.

345
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,340
It's about value and principles.

346
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,860
I don't want to forget

347
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,540
why I was looking for this.

348
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,580
But now,

349
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,180
here,

350
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,100
I can't remember

351
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,980
how I was originally.

352
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,100
Are you sure

353
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,180
you can get back to your original self

354
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,420
after you leave the Communist Party?

355
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,940
Are you sure you can?

356
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,700
Feng-Yi.

357
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Come.

358
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,300
Come.

359
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Feng-Yi.

360
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,860
Our Xi-Hui is very caring.

361
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,940
He loves to study.

362
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,900
I think

363
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,860
he will definitely

364
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,540
have a good relationship

365
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,300
with the person who is the leader of the Communist Party.

366
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,060
As a teacher,

367
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,180
he is very hardworking.

368
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,180
He is really caring.

369
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Now, the children are very bad.

370
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,140
He is very good at education

371
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,380
and he is a teacher.

372
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,700
He is also very helpful

373
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
to the management.

374
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,700
I heard you were sleeping.

375
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,420
I came here to greet you.

376
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,020
What's the matter today?

377
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,100
Deputy Secretary.

378
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,620
You always talk about our marriage.

379
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,220
How can you be so serious today?

380
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,220
It's been a long time since I saw you.

381
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,660
You are as pretty as this.

382
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,060
Marriage is our first beauty.

383
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,860
Thank you for your good mood.

384
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,180
Xi-Hui.

385
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,540
You talk to your aunt

386
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,540
and call her your boyfriend.

387
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,260
The height is secret.

388
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,620
Is this your teacher?

389
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,580
You are so smart.

390
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,820
You are as smart as when you were young.

391
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,620
Gaping.

392
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,020
It's good to have a wife.

393
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,900
You can't do anything about your career.

394
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,220
Kun-Kun.

395
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,660
You are like a wife at the same time.

396
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,820
Kun-Kun.

397
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,100
You used to work with Lao Fei-Sam.

398
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,620
You are now working with our government.

399
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,900
Now

400
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,540
you want to work with Lao Fei-Sam

401
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,900
and the government.

402
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,820
You don't want to work with our government.

403
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,180
You don't want Lao Fei-Sam to fire you?

404
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,500
Min, you are so stupid.

405
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,260
I just came back to send a friend

406
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,020
to eat a bun.

407
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,900
Our government is a little weird.

408
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,460
But anyway,

409
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,420
you are a decent person.

410
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,940
You are a smart person.

411
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,980
You are so smart.

412
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,700
You are not that smart.

413
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
You are so stupid to go to work with others.

414
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Why don't you work with others?

415
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,540
It's better to work with the government.

416
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,260
Kun-Kun.

417
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,140
You are afraid of Lao Fei-Sam.

418
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,520
You want to be a

419
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,980
good wife.

420
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,100
The government is right.

421
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,620
He wants to work with you.

422
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,140
He doesn't want to work with the government.

423
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,780
He wants to work with you.

424
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,060
Min, you are almost there.

425
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Okay.

426
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,900
Kun-Kun.

427
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,260
We have been married for a long time.

428
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,780
You are really

429
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,060
familiar with our family.

430
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,460
I don't want to marry you.

431
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,540
If you want to work with us this time,

432
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,020
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
I won't be able to help you.

434
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,780
Jian Jia-Shin.

435
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,780
You are Bobby.

436
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,380
You can't go to work with your wife.

437
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,060
If you don't know about the typhoon,

438
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,420
what's the cost?

439
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
The cost of the construction?

440
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
I won't talk about that.

441
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,420
If you don't know,

442
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,420
how can you go to work with your wife?

443
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,420
I'll tell you.

444
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
Right.

445
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,620
You should tell me about this.

446
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,620
If you don't go to work,

447
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,620
if you don't tell me,

448
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,620
the whole factory will be ruined.

449
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
Hi.

450
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,460
Hi.

451
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,060
Young people.

452
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,060
I wish you happiness.

453
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,860
I'm going to tell you about the typhoon.

454
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,060
This time, I'll tell you.

455
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,060
You can see the map.

456
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
You'll know that

457
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
the typhoon is coming.

458
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Dad.

459
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
You have to think of a way.

460
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
How old am I?

461
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
How many times have I told you?

462
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
You can do whatever you want.

463
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
The people in the building

464
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
are making you feel uncomfortable.

465
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,500
You should be more considerate.

466
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Or I'll find someone to cooperate with.

467
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
What are you doing here?

468
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
The people in the building

469
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
are making you feel uncomfortable.

470
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,940
The police are so worried.

471
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
No one wants to help.

472
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,940
They're all on the front lines.

473
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Dad, you have to think of a way.

474
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
It's the same as the typhoon.

475
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
If you don't know what to do,

476
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,940
don't tell anyone to go to the air-raid shelter.

477
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,940
That's too much for you.

478
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,940
You're always like this.

479
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,940
I won't go anywhere.

480
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,940
If you don't go to the air-raid shelter,

481
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
you'll be in trouble.

482
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,940
I'm your opponent.

483
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,940
So you want me to go to the air-raid shelter?

484
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
I'm just a woman.

485
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
I don't want to be with a man

486
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
who's not my age.

487
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
I don't care about my age.

488
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
I don't care about my future.

489
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,940
You're trying to get a husband.

490
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,940
You have three children and one boyfriend.

491
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,940
What are you saying?

492
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,940
You're a woman.

493
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
Who's the most important?

494
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,940
What do you mean?

495
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,940
I can't love anyone else.

496
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,940
I have to get married.

497
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,940
It's the same with your mother.

498
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,940
You have to find someone like your dad.

499
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380
You're not going to marry after you get married?

500
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,380
Okay.

501
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,380
Let's get married.

502
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,380
You're so unreasonable.

503
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,380
You two are always fighting.

504
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,380
You always think that you can get married.

505
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,380
But my grandfather always scolds you.

506
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,380
He always beat you up.

507
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,380
I'm the one who's the most important now.

508
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
You're the one who's the most important.

509
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,380
I'm the one who's the most important.

510
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,380
My grandfather beat me up.

511
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,380
He's always been the most important person to me.

512
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,380
He always treated me like this for that beggar.

513
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Every time I talk about getting married,

514
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,380
my grandfather always scolds me and my parents.

515
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,780
I was really angry when I was little

516
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,140
that they were going to divorce.

517
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,860
But I don't know why

518
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,860
I'm the only one left now.

519
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,140
I understand.

520
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,660
You don't understand.

521
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,260
Do you know how I felt

522
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,260
when everyone said my dad was useless?

523
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,060
I don't know.

524
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,820
I felt very confused.

525
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,820
It was him who made me like this.

526
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,100
I don't want to tell you anymore.

527
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,820
You didn't do anything wrong.

528
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,820
It's not wrong to like or hate your father.

529
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,820
People are complicated.

530
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,820
But even if you do something wrong,

531
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
he is still your father.

532
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,820
He will love you.

533
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,820
The End

534
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,820
How did you know we were coming back?

535
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Take it and wait.

536
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,820
The world is different.

537
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,820
People from the world of the capital are all gone.

538
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
It's so scary.

539
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,820
What's scary?

540
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,820
When you see the people from their hometown,

541
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,820
you think of the homeless people.

542
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,820
I told you not to come.

543
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,820
You insisted.

544
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,820
I told you not to come.

545
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,820
You insisted.

546
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,820
I'm leaving.

547
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,820
I'm leaving.

548
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,820
If you want to suffer,

549
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,820
you can do it anytime.

550
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,820
But I'm starting to be an official.

551
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,820
I might have to force myself.

552
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,820
Okay, I'm leaving.

553
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,820
Bye.

554
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,820
The End

555
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,820
The End

556
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,820
Your mother is in the hospital.

557
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,820
She doesn't want to see the doctor.

558
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,820
She's been crying all day.

559
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,820
She's been calling her mother.

560
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,820
She's been calling her mother.

561
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,820
I'm sorry, grandpa.

562
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,820
You haven't slept all night.

563
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,820
If your mother didn't see you sleep,

564
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,820
how could she have slept?

565
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,820
You don't know how long you've been sleeping.

566
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,820
I know.

567
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,820
I'm going to put the food in the fridge.

568
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,820
I'll be back soon.

569
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,820
Do you want to eat?

570
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
I'm full.

571
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,820
I'm going to the hospital.

572
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,820
This is Yi Li's house.

573
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,820
Do you want to sit there?

574
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,820
No.

575
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,820
The End

576
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Are you done?

577
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
I'm leaving.

578
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,820
Do you have a bag?

579
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
Thank you.

580
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,820
Get in the car.

581
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,820
Where's the doctor?

582
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,820
Auntie.

583
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,820
Wait.

584
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,820
The car is here.

585
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
If you tell him, he won't go home.

586
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,820
Auntie, we'll talk later.

587
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,820
Get in the car.

588
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,820
Is the car here?

589
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
That's a high-profile certificate.

590
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,820
Everyone is lying.

591
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Why is this a fake?

592
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,820
Auntie.

593
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,820
You've proven that the two of them are both fake.

594
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,820
I think it's a bit of a murder.

595
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,780
It's a

596
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,780
This two of them have the right to vote.

597
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,780
It's a very difficult decision.

598
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,780
You see Zheng Guang.

599
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,780
He's not a good person.

600
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,780
He doesn't see people.

601
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,780
He's not as good as me.

602
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,780
What time is it now?

603
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,780
He's in the North.

604
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,780
What's he doing?

605
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,780
He's going to help the old people in the North.

606
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,740
You're going to help him build a shop?

607
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,740
It's normal.

608
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,740
If you feel uncomfortable, tell us.

609
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,780
I'll do it.

610
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,780
Are you sure?

611
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,780
I'll do whatever I want with you.

612
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,780
What did you say?

613
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,780
I told her I'll help you build a bad chain shop.

614
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,600
I'm going to help you build a Whitei.

615
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
Go on.

616
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
I'm sorry.

617
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
It's nothing to be sorry about.

618
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
I'm sorry.

619
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
I really thought

620
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,780
I would have a lot of time to spend with you.

621
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
But I'm sorry.

622
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
I'm sorry.

623
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
I'm sorry.

624
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,780
I'm sorry.

625
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,780
I'm sorry.

626
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
I'm sorry.

627
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
I really thought

628
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,780
I would have a lot of time to spend with you.

629
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,780
You have your time.

630
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
I have mine.

631
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
But family and friends

632
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,780
have to face it together.

633
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Together.

634
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Together.

635
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,780
And then let go together.

636
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,780
You're so hungry.

637
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,780
The committee is here.

638
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,780
The committee is here.

639
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,780
He will help you with your job.

640
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
You're so kind.

641
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,780
You're working in the office.

642
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
I'm in charge of the top two.

643
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
I'm in charge of the top two.

644
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
Ming-jie.

645
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
Ming-jie.

646
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,780
Ming-jie.

647
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
The news from the committee.

648
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
Okay.

649
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,780
As a legal committee member,

650
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,780
what is my job?

651
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,780
When should I insist?

652
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,780
When should I give up?

653
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
When should I compromise?

654
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,780
I rely on my own belief and values.

655
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
I declare here

656
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
that I will quit the party

657
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,780
from now on.

658
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,780
I will return to the second election of Qingyun

659
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,780
as a party member.

660
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,780
Why are you so serious?

661
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,780
To face the next abduction case.

662
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,780
In the past two years,

663
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,780
there have been many conflicts

664
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,780
between the bill and the issue

665
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,780
and the promotion of reform

666
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,780
with the executive committee.

667
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,780
I won't talk about it here.

668
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,780
The last straw

669
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,780
is the bill of Peng Tie Company.

670
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
But I always think

671
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
that safety is a matter

672
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
that cannot be conceded

673
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,780
and can not be compromised.

674
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,780
Next, I will continue to contribute

675
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
to the local community

676
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,780
in my own way.

677
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,780
Serving all friends

678
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,780
who need to be served.

679
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,780
Serving all friends who need to be served.

680
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,780
I don't know if this is a bad habit

681
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
or a big thought.

682
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,780
This is not a conflict.

683
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,780
I don't know about Jian Jiaxin.

684
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
I want to know.

685
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
I told you before

686
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
that the bill is not a big deal.

687
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Is there a suitable candidate

688
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
among the current members?

689
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
If I really want to say

690
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,780
Jian Guangkun's grandson, Jian Qihui, is great.

691
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
He is handsome and has a good temper.

692
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
What is his background?

693
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
He is a teacher.

694
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,780
If he has a chance, he can know.

695
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,780
Teacher?

696
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
Meeting is over.

697
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,780
Come and take a photo.

698
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
Good luck.

699
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
Everyone is healthy and safe.

700
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780
Good luck.

701
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
Okay.

702
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
Come on.

703
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
Everyone, come on.

704
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
Good luck.

705
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,780
The test is over.

706
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,780
Doctor, you come too.

707
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,780
Come on.

708
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
Everyone is healthy and safe.

709
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,780
Good luck.

710
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
Come on.

711
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
I will come too.

712
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,780
I prepared the noodles.

713
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
Everyone will eat together.

714
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,780
Come on.

715
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,780
Brother Lisheng.

716
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Don't leave the hospital.

717
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
Come on, sit down.

718
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,780
Don't worry.

719
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,780
Thank you for taking care of them.

720
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,780
Taking care of them

721
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,780
gives me the motivation to live.

722
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
So,

723
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
you don't have to be polite.

724
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,780
We are each other's.

725
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Here.

726
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,780
You are leaving?

727
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,780
From today on, you and your grandpa will sleep together.

728
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
Let's go.

729
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
Let's go.

730
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Let me tell you.

731
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,780
Your mom just got out of the hospital.

732
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
She is not suitable to drive.

733
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
I will take you to the hospital tomorrow.

734
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,780
Do you know that?

735
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,780
Don't sleep too much.

736
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,780
Did you hear that?

737
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
Yes.

738
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Let's go and ask your mom.

739
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
You are so annoying.

740
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Sorry.

741
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
You are going to say it again.

742
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
Sister Chen, calm down.

743
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
Let's go.

744
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,780
Okay.

745
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
You go.

746
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
It's okay.

747
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
It's okay.

748
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
Let's go.

749
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Or else, Miss Chen,

750
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,780
I will put the business card in your mailbox.

751
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,780
Call me when you want to talk.

752
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,780
Brother Fei is here.

753
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Sorry.

754
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,780
I'm sorry.

755
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,780
I didn't help you.

756
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,780
I don't know that you are still so unstable

757
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,780
after coming back from the hospital.

758
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,780
It takes time to establish a relationship.

759
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
And,

760
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Sister Xin Zhu is willing to accompany me today.

761
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
I am already very grateful.

762
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
That's because of this case.

763
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
She is more sensitive to boys.

764
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,780
Otherwise, I don't have time to accompany you.

765
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,780
Thank you.

766
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
Qi Hui.

767
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,780
Why are you here?

768
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,780
I am here for a family interview.

769
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,780
Or else,

770
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,780
we will get back to work.

771
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
I will go first.

772
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,780
Okay.

773
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,780
Sister Xin Zhu, you have worked hard today.

774
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
No.

775
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
Be careful.

776
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Okay.

777
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
You are busy.

778
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
Let's keep in touch.

779
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
Okay.

780
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
Bye.

781
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,780
Are you going to go or is it just over?

782
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
It's over.

783
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,780
I am done today.

784
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
Or else, let's have dinner together.

785
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,780
Qi Hui.

786
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,780
I know that this matter has nothing to do with you.

787
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,780
I only have the courage to tell you now.

788
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,780
But,

789
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,780
I don't know

790
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,780
how long it has been.

791
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,780
I don't know how long it has been.

792
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
I don't know.

793
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,780
I don't know.

794
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,780
Long time no see.

795
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,780
Long time no see.

796
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,780
Don't mind me.

797
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,780
Go back and rest.

798
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,780
Did you bring your certificate?

799
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,780
I did.

800
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,780
What do you want for lunch?

801
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,780
I will bring it for you.

802
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,780
I must need to get my medical certificate.

803
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,780
Good luck.

804
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,780
Good luck.

805
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
You guys go back first.

806
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
I will go home after the exam.

807
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
Good luck.

808
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Good luck.

809
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,780
You are the first place.

810
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
Boy.

811
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,780
Good luck.

812
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,780
You have grown up.

813
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,780
Good luck.

814
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,780
You are the first place.

815
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
Thank you.

816
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,780
You are the first place.

817
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,780
You are the first place.

818
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,780
Good luck.

819
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,780
Good luck.

820
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,780
Good luck.

821
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,780
You are the first place.

822
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,780
You are the first place.

823
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
Good luck.

824
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
We don't need it.

825
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,780
Thank you.

826
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
You are the first place.

827
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,780
Good luck.

828
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,780
Let's go.

829
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,780
Good luck.

830
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,780
I didn't expect that after so long,

831
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,780
I still got jealous

832
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
when I saw that person's name.

833
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
I just wanted to find

834
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
a place where no one knew me.

835
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
I didn't expect that

836
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,780
I would live like this for twenty years.

837
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,780
The past years

838
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,780
are not your problem.

839
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
In your head,

840
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
you are going to put on

841
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
good memories.

842
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,780
Drink the medicine.

843
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,780
Do more exercise.

844
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,780
Take more walks.

845
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,780
Did you take the medicine?

846
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,780
Does it work?

847
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,780
It can help me not to feel so painful.

848
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,780
Sometimes,

849
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,780
it can also help me

850
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,780
to remember some good memories.

851
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,780
Dad, hurry up.

852
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,780
Or I will go to eat pudding first.

853
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
Fatty,

854
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,780
are you going to wait for me

855
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,780
for three thousand meters?

856
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,780
Wait for me.

857
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,780
Wait for me.

858
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,780
You are so naughty.

859
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,780
What medicine do you take?

860
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,780
I want to take the same medicine as you.

861
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,780
But

862
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,780
the previous one

863
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
is not good.

864
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,780
I wish you a better family.

865
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,780
You can start a new life.

866
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,780
No.

867
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,780
Thank you for remembering me.

868
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
How could you...

869
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
It's nothing.

870
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,780
I have mentioned it to you before.

871
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,780
Really?

872
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,780
The judge of the criminal court

873
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,780
is very good.

874
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,780
She is also

875
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,780
your aunt's girlfriend.

876
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,780
Really?

877
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,780
You haven't seen each other for half a year.

878
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,780
You can't send two messages.

879
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,780
How can you be her boyfriend?

880
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780
Is she really busy in Taipei?

881
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,780
Can I ask

882
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,780
about my relationship with my dad?

883
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,780
In principle,

884
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,780
I can't give you any opinions or comments.

885
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,780
But I can help you

886
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,780
introduce your lawyer friends.

887
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
Okay?

888
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
Okay?

889
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Dad, please help me.

890
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,780
Please.

891
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,780
I'm so sorry

892
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,780
to have to

893
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,780
be your friend.

894
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,780
Everyone,

895
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,780
please help me.

896
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,780
It's a ball.

897
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
I'm so happy

898
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
to be here today.

899
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,780
I have a good news

900
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,780
to tell you.

901
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,780
Before we were in Taiwan,

902
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,780
the police

903
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,780
and the executive

904
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,780
came to help us.

905
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,780
They cleaned up every room

906
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,780
in our entire country.

907
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Is that okay?

908
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,780
Yes.

909
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,780
Is that okay?

910
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,780
Yes.

911
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
Please give them a round of applause.

912
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,780
Thank you.

913
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,780
Thank you.

914
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,780
Thank you.

915
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,780
Now,

916
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,780
we will continue

917
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,780
to give you a round of applause.

918
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,780
Next,

919
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,780
we will have a match.

920
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,780
Now,

921
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,780
I wish

922
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,780
everyone

923
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,780
can have a good meal.

924
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,780
Lastly,

925
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,780
I wish you all

926
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,780
a big round of applause.

927
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,780
Thank you.

928
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,780
Thank you.

929
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,780
Okay,

930
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
we have a big surprise

931
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,780
for you.

932
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,780
It's raining like this.

933
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,780
We didn't

934
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,780
have enough clothes.

935
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,780
Yes.

936
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,780
But when we touched the clothes,

937
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,780
they were all black.

938
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,780
You two,

939
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,780
we will wait for you in the car.

940
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,780
Okay.

941
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,780
You two,

942
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,780
you should

943
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
stay longer.

944
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,780
You should

945
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,780
stay longer.

946
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,780
You can listen to me sing.

947
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,780
I have been practicing hard recently.

948
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,780
My singing should improve.

949
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,780
You should use your singing

950
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,780
to change the election culture.

951
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,780
If I don't do this,

952
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,780
I can't

953
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,780
be who I am.

954
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,780
You can't

955
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,780
be yourself in the party.

956
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,780
You have to start running

957
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,780
the red and white factory

958
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,780
to be yourself.

959
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,780
I don't want to

960
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,780
rely on the political party.

961
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,780
So I have to run

962
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,780
the local factory more.

963
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,780
Then why don't you

964
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,780
run the factory more?

965
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,780
See you.

966
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,780
Lu Yu,

967
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,780
take the food back.

968
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,780
Okay.

969
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,780
Take it.

970
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,780
You take it.

971
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,780
That's too much.

972
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,780
You take some back.

973
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,780
No,

974
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,780
I can't eat that much

975
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,780
by myself.

976
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,780
Then come and eat with us.

977
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,780
Yes, you are fine.

978
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,780
You two are so good at eating.

979
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,780
I can eat anything

980
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,780
especially you.

981
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,780
Don't climb up in the middle of the night

982
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,780
and eat it as if you were drinking.

983
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,780
Do you know that?

984
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,780
I poured all the wine.

985
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,780
That's the best.

986
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,780
Okay.

987
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,780
You two go to take a shower.

988
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,780
Hurry up.

989
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,780
I'm leaving.

990
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,780
Lu Yu,

991
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,780
I will watch you

992
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,780
plan the construction plan.

993
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,780
Okay.

994
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,780
Your brother is still

995
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,780
so busy recently.

996
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,780
He comes back

997
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,780
so early every day.

998
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,780
He is going to be dismissed.

999
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,780
He must be very sad.

1000
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,780
It's the time when he needs us the most.

1001
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,780
Doesn't he know

1002
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,780
that you need him

1003
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,780
the most?

1004
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,780
We are doing great now.

1005
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,780
You just got discharged.

1006
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,780
Don't force yourself too much.

1007
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,780
It's okay.

1008
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,780
You can go back first.

1009
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,780
I'm leaving.

1010
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,780
Thank you so much

1011
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,780
for taking care of our family.

1012
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,780
But you are a doctor.

1013
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,780
It's your duty to save people.

1014
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,780
Don't forget your talent.

1015
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,780
Good night.

1016
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,780
You two are so noisy.

1017
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,780
Why don't you go to take a shower?

1018
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,780
The window is closed.

1019
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,780
Wait for the shower.

1020
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,780
Go upstairs.

1021
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,780
You can take the door

1022
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,780
to the bathroom.

1023
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,780
I'm sorry.

1024
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,780
I'm sorry.

1025
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,780
I'm sorry.

1026
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,780
I'm sorry.

1027
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,780
I'm sorry.

1028
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,780
I'm sorry.

1029
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,780
I'm sorry.

1030
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,780
I'm sorry.

1031
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,780
I'm sorry.

1032
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,780
I'm sorry.

1033
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,780
I'm sorry.

1034
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,780
I'm sorry.

1035
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,780
I'm sorry.

1036
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:20,780
I'm sorry.

1037
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,780
I'm sorry.

1038
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,780
I'm sorry.

1039
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,780
I'm sorry.

1040
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,780
I'm sorry.

1041
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,780
I'm sorry.

1042
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,780
I'm sorry.

1043
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,780
I'm sorry.

1044
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,780
I'm sorry.

1045
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,780
I'm sorry.

1046
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,780
I'm sorry.

1047
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,780
I'm sorry.

1048
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,780
I'm sorry.

1049
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,780
I'm sorry.

1050
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,780
I'm sorry.

1051
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,780
I'm sorry.

1052
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,780
I'm sorry.

1053
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,780
I'm sorry.

1054
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,780
I'm sorry.

1055
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,780
I'm sorry.

1056
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,780
I'm sorry.

1057
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,780
I'm sorry.

1058
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,780
I'm sorry.

1059
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,780
I'm sorry.

1060
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,780
I'm sorry.

1061
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,780
I'm sorry.

1062
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,780
I'm sorry.

1063
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,780
I'm sorry.

1064
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,780
I'm sorry.

1065
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,780
I'm sorry.

1066
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,780
I'm sorry.

1067
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,780
I'm sorry.

1068
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,780
I'm sorry.

1069
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,780
I'm sorry.

1070
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,780
I'm sorry.

1071
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,780
I'm sorry.

1072
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,780
I'm sorry.

1073
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,780
I'm sorry.

1074
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,780
I'm sorry.

1075
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
I'm sorry.

1076
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,780
I'm sorry.

1077
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,780
I'm sorry.

1078
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
I'm so sorry.

1079
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,780
Please don't leave me alone.

1080
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,680
I don't like you

1081
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,980
what happened?

1082
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:06,760
come on

1083
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,540
Good night

1084
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,080
I've come

1085
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,580
some narrow street

1086
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,620
and your child

1087
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,820
were also in the supermarket.

1088
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,820
I'm really sorry.

1089
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,900
After the incident,

1090
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,540
I asked the criminal to contact

1091
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,100
all the families.

1092
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,500
I hope I can make some compensation.

1093
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,740
How much money can you make to make up for

1094
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,940
losing your family?

1095
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,820
That's not what I meant.

1096
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,060
I've been thinking about it

1097
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,900
since the accident.

1098
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,460
I should have given him the money.

1099
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,260
Isn't that enough?

1100
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,460
What on earth am I holding on to?

1101
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,220
It would be great if I were the one

1102
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:09,900
who burned to death.

1103
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,420
If I...

1104
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,700
If I had killed him earlier,

1105
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,660
would I not have had

1106
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,580
to deal with the consequences?

1107
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,540
Let him go.

1108
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,500
I'd rather give up my job

1109
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,340
than be mission inspired.

1110
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,620
If I'd just set a皇 pointed prefect,

1111
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,220
then I would change my position.

1112
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,660
It is a rumors.

1113
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,660
Don't get involved in such huge crap.

1114
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,900
You go to the office and tell me

1115
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,360
The office is still the same

1116
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,500
I just noticed

1117
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,600
You

1118
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,560
The decision-making team

1119
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,900
They all have their own reasons

1120
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,960
It's that

1121
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,440
If you want to split up

1122
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,540
You don't have to cooperate again

1123
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,240
That's not a good idea

1124
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,180
The situation is always split up

1125
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,180
But

1126
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,120
I've been with you for so many years

1127
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,980
I want to ask you a question

1128
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,420
What's your purpose?

1129
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,780
Mr. Chuan

1130
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,720
I'm sorry to bother you again

1131
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,620
I'm not the one who's not concerned about you

1132
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,660
Well

1133
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,960
After the meeting with the government

1134
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,800
You should support the family to participate in the financial security plan

1135
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,560
Mr. Chuan

1136
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,060
You're too much

1137
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,100
Mr. Chuan, you don't listen to me
