00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,330
You look good like this.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,630
What?

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,870
Why is this happening?

♫ The strong wind erases the trembling water's surface ♫

♫ The dark sky vanished as the light shone in ♫

♫ The dark sky vanished as the light shone in ♫

♫ The surface tension expands as it starts overflowing ♫

♫ I wonder if I will get used to the affection,
Shedding tears while trembling ♫

[MY PERSONAL WEATHERMAN]

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,382
[EPISODE 8]
What do I do?

11
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:08,440
I'm scared.

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,230
Is it too tight?

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,700
Well, you'd go out otherwise.

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,180
You know... Have you ever considered how I feel?

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,150
No, right?

16
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,660
Doesn't seem like you get it.

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Listen to me if you want me to untie you.

18
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,610
Don't act cute towards other people. Stay away from girls and other guys.

19
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,120
Don't look, talk, or smile at them.

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,990
You can't escape from me.

21
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,730
For the rest of your life...

22
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,230
you'll be mine...

23
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,310
No.

24
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,950
Forget what I said.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,170
That's not what I meant.

26
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,520
Huh?

27
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,630
That's weird.

28
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,500
I've drawn this face so many times, obsessively.

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,400
But did he always have a face like this?

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,130
Are you...

31
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,700
sulking?

32
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,730
Don't say weird things like that.

33
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,130
I...

34
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,100
won't go out.

35
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,200
I never...

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,730
planned to.

37
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,800
Then...

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
you shouldn't make me think that.

39
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,130
Sorry.

40
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,510
What is going on?

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,700
Are my eyes going bad?

42
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,080
He looks like he's sulking like a spoiled kid.

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,340
Are you scared that I might...

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,500
go somewhere?

45
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,520
It's one thing if it's that woman, but stop flirting with that guy with the glasses.

46
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,930
You really have the nerve to behave frivolously.

47
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,240
It makes me uneasy.

48
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,880
You don't like it when I get along...

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,700
with other people?

50
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,930
You know I'm not a kind person.

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,370
And I don't listen to others.

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,700
Why's he...

53
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,350
acting so weak?

54
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,410
Does he worry about stuff like that?

55
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,310
You of all people?

56
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,850
Hey.

57
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,840
How do I make you mine, and mine alone?

58
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,660
How did I not notice all this time that he felt this way about me?

59
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,580
Feeling sorry for himself...

60
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,930
Covering his ears...

61
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,510
What is this?

62
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,610
My heart hurts.

63
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,790
I can't breathe.

64
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,750
You're the only one

65
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,900
I've ever done things like this with.

66
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,930
Isn't that enough?

67
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,250
No.

68
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,870
It's not.

69
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,480
Huh?

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,060
Swear you won't do it with anyone else, for the rest of your life.

71
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,200
What's so great

72
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,170
about someone like me?

73
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,620
Hm?

74
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,810
That's a secret.

75
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,370
You're such a bully.

76
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,070
Well...

77
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,860
in that case...

78
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,010
Maybe it's because you like being bullied.

79
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,570
Don't just say whatever you want.

80
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,660
You like it.

81
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,500
No,

82
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,190
this guy is bad news.

83
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,500
Grabbing hold of people through their insecurities is awful.

84
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,020
But

85
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,020
there's something wrong with me as well...

86
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,180
because I enjoy it.

87
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,600
I think...

88
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,200
I like it.

89
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,140
Wait, untie me first.

90
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,740
I can't.

91
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,150
Huh?

92
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,460
You're cold, right? I'll run the bath.

93
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,360
Don't go.

94
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,470
Suit yourself.

95
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm going to take my sweet time.

96
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:56,120
So that even a thickheaded guy like you

97
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,090
will understand how I feel.

98
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,120
I hope you're ready.

99
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,910
Um...

100
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,510
What?

101
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,010
Who's the guy with the glasses?

102
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,820
Did I draw you with glasses in the manga?

103
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,190
What?

104
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,570
The manga?

105
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,330
Yeah,

106
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,890
the one Man-san drew.

107
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,940
The one about you and me.

108
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,040
What?

109
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,740
Hey, your face is beet red.

110
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
It's so hot.

111
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,300
You have a fever.

112
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,550
Hello, everyone.

113
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,090
Today is July 28, and the time is 1 p.m.

114
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,140
We're here for the next three hours on Everyday Weather. I'm Hiyoshi Aika.

115
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,408
Our usual weatherman, Segasaki-san, is not in the office today. In his stead...

116
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:56,000
No, what is going on here?

117
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,420
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.

118
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,730
Kanami-chan, you're being loud.
[Dayo-chan: This is too much.]

119
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,720
Dayo... Segasaki... What?

120
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,490
Let's try to use our words a bit more.

121
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,060
My phone!

122
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,760
Dayo-chan. Did Segasaki-san die? Or did you die?

123
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,000
What?

124
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,730
Are you okay? You are, right?

125
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,550
You're just dead after a sexy weekend, right?

126
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,430
Kanami-san.

127
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,650
Huh?

128
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,670
It's Segasaki.

129
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,000
The man himself.

130
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,600
Oh, um, I'm really sorry.

131
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,800
And I'm also super sorry about the manga.

132
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,830
The manga?

133
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,370
I didn't mean any harm.

134
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,980
My impulses just kinda took hold of me.

135
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,400
Which turned into a small comic.

136
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,680
Well, I mean its physical size.

137
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,670
That's not to say the contents are small in the slightest.

138
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,490
Can you tell me more?

139
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,490
Um...

140
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,200
Huh?

141
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,320
Where did you get that?

142
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,560
Kanami-san gave it to me.

143
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,450
Wow, is this what you want me to say?

144
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,470
Well, it's just a manga.

145
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,130
It's fiction.

146
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,020
Oh, really?

147
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,290
So,

148
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,020
"I can find all the pretty girls I want at work.

149
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,480
But out of all our countless viewers,

150
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,790
I prefer you, the one waiting for me at home.

151
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,530
Don't make me jealous by getting close to someone else.

152
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,640
Or else, even I'll lose my cool.

153
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,820
Believe me.

154
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,710
You're the only one I love."

155
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:38,278
Yoh.

156
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,730
What kind of face is that?

157
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,110
Well...

158
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,990
Having a normal person reading a manga out loud is a bit...

159
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,300
What?

160
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,210
Well, I mean...

161
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,071
- Wait, are you mad?
- Whatever.

162
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,290
Jeez, my friend's boyfriend has such a nice face.

163
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,521
But that really scared me. I didn't think Segasaki-san would pick up the phone.

164
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,260
I sincerely apologize.

165
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,150
Was Segasaki-san mad?

166
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,900
Yeah, probably.

167
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,600
He wasn't particularly mad about anything in the manga though.

168
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,550
Oh, can you come to the sales booth on the fourth?

169
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,100
I'm not sure.

170
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,670
You can bring Segasaki-san too.

171
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,340
No, people will find out.

172
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,860
The setting is fake, but the face is too similar.

173
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,260
Oh, well. I'll just bring Akkun.

174
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,450
Your husband is popular. Stop that.

175
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,400
Oh, Akkun said he likes your manga.

176
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,060
Oh, he read it?

177
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,560
He really is like a Buddha.

178
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,460
He said the guys you draw look exactly like Segasaki-san.

179
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,130
No one asked him.

180
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,940
Stop complicating your feelings for him.

Because that guy is...

00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:16,152
[It will rain in the afternoon.]
[Thank you.]
[Remember to get the laundry.]
[Okay.]

187
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:17,360
[I want curry for dinner.]
[You got it.]

188
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,260
♫ Opposite the long falling shadow, I looked
at your distant back ♫

189
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,620
♫ And followed you with an even distance ♫

190
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,010
♫ I wonder if you cried or laughed ♫

191
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,080
♫ I wonder what your eyes were reflecting ♫

192
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,800
♫ The more you put it into words ♫

193
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,880
♫ The more my heart vanishes ♫

194
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,450
♫ I want you to feel the body warmth that touches you ♫

195
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,100
♫ The time we spend together ♫

196
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,730
♫ I had hoped it would last forever ♫

197
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,960
♫ What a moment of sparkling lights ♫

198
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,330
♫ But eventually it becomes a memory ♫

199
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,630
♫ We exchanged a promise in a secret place ♫

200
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:24,070
♫ A date I couldn't keep ♫

201
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,570
♫ If I could still go back ♫

202
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,190
Man-san and her husband wanted me to give you their regards.

203
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,500
You were calling that woman again, huh?

204
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,160
Well, I was doing work with her at a cafe.

205
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,900
What? With the glasses guy too?

206
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,680
No, just Man-san.

207
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,930
Ugh, you're really...

208
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,670
Huh? Isn't it okay to work with Man-san?

209
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,150
I introduced you to her.

210
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,780
I just wanted to know who she is.

211
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,830
I didn't say you can hang out with her.

212
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,710
What's with this guy?

213
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,240
Hey, wait...

214
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,250
The pot's hot. It's dangerous.

215
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,900
Hey, don't you have any other friends?

216
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,880
Well, I do, but they're all night owls.

217
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,860
The only one I can work with during the day is Man-san.

218
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,840
Fine.

219
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,560
I'll let you meet her outside on one condition.

220
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,920
Let me sleep with you on those nights.

221
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,480
What?

222
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,400
I'll let you call her anytime.

223
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,330
That's...

224
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,000
That's all I'd think about on sunny days.

225
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,370
No.

226
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,627
Did that make you happy?

227
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,990
It's like a reward.

228
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,810
You get to meet your friend and have sex.

229
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,890
Isn't that great?

230
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,480
I'm kidding.

231
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
But in exchange,

232
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,780
when I get home, come to the front door.

233
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,971
Even if you're on the phone.

234
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,440
And say, "Welcome home."

235
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,360
That's what you wanted?

236
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,660
Is that so bad?

237
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,150
No,

238
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,360
not really.

239
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,180
I really don't understand him very well.

240
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,510
Is he happy with just that?

241
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,310
Welcome home.

242
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,560
How was your work today?

243
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,700
That's for today.

244
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,760
I'll say it at the door next time.

245
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,290
♫ I accidentally think back to that day and
my chest tightens painfully ♫

246
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,870
Wait, the curry's almost done.

247
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,080
It's fine. There's something else I want to eat first.

248
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,900
♫ Why don't you tell me about it, so I can understand? ♫

249
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,490
♫ A sultry night that seems endless ♫

250
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,590
♫ I hope I will get through it alone ♫

251
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,310
♫ I can't be pampered ♫

252
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,530
♫ By the shoulder to lean on,
so I pushed it away, pretending to be tough ♫

253
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:30,140
♫ But what excuse have I not already made ♫

254
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,530
♫ The first times you granted me ♫

255
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,110
♫ Each of them still lives inside me ♫

256
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,030
- Thanks for the food.
- Let's eat.

257
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,660
♫ When you reached out your hand ♫

258
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,380
♫ It almost seemed like I could touch it ♫

259
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,660
♫ All the way, all the way ♫

260
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,140
It's chicken.

261
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,000
♫ We exchanged a promise in a secret place ♫

262
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,090
Huh? Is that bad?

263
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:02,440
♫ A date I couldn't keep ♫

264
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,250
What?

265
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,020
It's nothing.

266
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:16,020
♫ All the way, that's my wish ♫

267
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,680
♫ I'll surely keep remembering it ♫

268
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,040
It's not bad.

269
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,820
- Huh?
- It's not bad.

270
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,160
Oh, really?

271
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,860
Hey, Yoh.
