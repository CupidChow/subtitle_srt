Oh, hello?

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,440
Hello, there.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,660
This is Ishizaki, your editor. Can we talk now?

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,740
Oh, sure.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,490
I don't want to waste our time, so I'll cut to the chase.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,960
Sorry, we can't give you any more work.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,610
What?

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,578
I wanted to keep trying with you, since I like your works,

10
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:40,680
but I can't do much because your works aren't selling.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,040
Well, I could kind of tell since before,

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,530
but the men you draw look like heroes from a girls' manga.

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,200
For another man, it's kind of a turn-off.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,090
He's pretty, a hard worker, and seems kind of standoffish,

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,430
but is always there to come save you.

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,726
It's just so far removed from reality.

17
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:04,646

00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,860
Today's a hot one.
[EPISODE 5]

25
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,131
Please stay hydrated and be extra careful with heat stroke.

26
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:15,620
Be sure to use an air conditioner or fan as needed around your house.

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,360
The irregular job I had since college, doing one-shot stories, is gone too.

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,515
I'm completely out of work.

29
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,540
I have to at least do the housework properly.

30
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:35,587
Maybe I can bring my works to other companies.

31
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,810
But no one would meet someone with my credentials.

32
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,360
There's proof that my work doesn't sell.

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,000
Who'd hire someone like me?

34
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,910
Why would he tell me something that important after firing me?

35
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,010
If my work isn't popular, I thought the editor is supposed to fix it.

36
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,100
I mean, that's the kind of guy I like.

37
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,610
Without any direction, of course that's what I'd draw.

38
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,850
It's your fault.

39
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,060
It's because someone like you is by my side.

40
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,870
You idiot.

41
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:43,416
As if I were drowning in the ocean with my clothes on,

42
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,120
the darkness seeps into me.

43
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,746
My body sucks it up...

44
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,660
and becomes soft and spongy.

45
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,800
It becomes heavier and heavier...

46
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,430
Hm?

47
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,290
Hey, Yoh.

48
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,480

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,900
Hey, you're here.

50
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,420
What're you doing with the lights off?

51
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,780
Darn, these have to be washed again.

52
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,440
I didn't make dinner.

53
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,630
Sorry.

54
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,020
I'll go make some now.

55
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:27,600
I guess it can't be helped.

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
Let's go.

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,270
Hey.

60
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,470

00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:16,355
Is it good?

73
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,210
I shouldn't have had any strength to eat...

74
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,340
Thanks for the food.

75
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,710
but I finished it all.

76
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,060
All right, time for a bath next.

77
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,040
Huh?

Are you feeling down?

83
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,320
My manga... is awful.

84
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,353
And you get like this when your manga is bad?

85
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,970
And that's all?

86
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,480
Yeah.

87
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,670
I see.

88
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,260
What do you mean, "that's all"?

89

I feel like I'm going to die, and yet...

90
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,110
The wind on the coast flips the directions during the day and at night.

91
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,700
And that moment the wind flips, it becomes calm.

92
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,770
That's called a lull.

93
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,890
You're experiencing a lull.

94
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,940
After a bit, another wind will come.

95
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,969
That's how it is.

96
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,670
Come on.

97
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,950
Why?

98
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,840
What do you mean?

99
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,990
Well, I thought you'd get mad at me.

100
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,340
I didn't do any housework.

101
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,570
Well, that's fine. It was beneficial for me.

102
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,960
Beneficial?

103
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,020
Yeah, I got to take a bath with you.

104
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,490
Hurry, come here.

105
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,440
It felt good watching you act the way you want today.

106
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,611
You should feel down more often.

107
00:11:56,611 --> 00:12:00,980
It was like we're real lovers.

108
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,800
It feels like you...

109
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,280
actually like me.

110
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,880
What? Do you want to do it?

111
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,680
What happened to you?

112
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,767
If that's what you want...

113
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,630
Despair and sex go well together.

114
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,700
Things get better even without thinking.

115
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,190
And it feels good even when you're in pain.

116
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:35,737
But what does that guy like about me?

117
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,820

I'm not sociable.

119
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm gloomy.

120
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,040
My food's not that great.

121
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,760
I'm not good in bed either.

122
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,560
Even as a college graduate, I don't have any work experience,

123
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,160
I have no talent as a manga artist, and I'm unemployed to boot.

124
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,590
Wait, maybe there is nothing good about me.

125
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,520
The wind was a bit strong today, but it was a nice, summer day with a breeze.

126
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,610
Yes, it was very hot.

127
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,500
Temperatures are expected to reach 34 degrees in central Tokyo.

128
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,900
I'm so sorry. I was supposed to say that.

129
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,270
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

130
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,420
I'm sorry for overstepping.

131
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,590
No, not at all.

132
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,780
Thank you for the follow-up.

133
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,790
Don't mention it.

134
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,939
There's no way we're a match.

135
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:18,920
Look at him. That's who I'm dealing with.

136
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,020
So, basically, you're saying it's tough being loved by an amazing guy.

137
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,740

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,640
"Wah!" Is that it?

139
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,620
I didn't say that.

140
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,590
I just wanted to say it's hard being unemployed.

141
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,720
Maybe I should give up on manga and find a company to work at.

142
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,930
What? That's such a waste.

143
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,700
I mean, the manga industry doesn't want me.

144
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,380
Only a handful of authors gain that kind of attention as a newcomer.

145
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,860
Everyone else makes pennies while working, you know.

146
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,500
Don't get so conceited.

147
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,970
You get to draw while living essentials are provided for you.

148
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:07,330
Getting all shaken because you lost your job once makes me sick to my stomach.

149
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,190
Man-san, that's overkill.

Huh?

153
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,870
Is that how little you felt about manga, Dayo-chan?

154
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,390
Think about it after calming down a bit.

155
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,880
Okay.

156
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,160
But I don't have any cash on me, so I need to work part-time.

157

00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,530
Wow.

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,520
It's okay if you fall sick again.

183
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,020
Alright.

184
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,660
Oh, is today your day off?

185
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,130
Hm? Why?

186
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,680
Oh, no reason.

187
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,460
I see.

188
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,720
He has a day off today of all days?

189
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:42,600
I can't tell him I'm heading out to draw a manga about us.

190
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,400
I don't even know if he'll let me go to Man-san's place for work.

191
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,180
I have to convince him somehow.

192
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,520
Um...

193
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,110
Yeah?

194
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,280
I have a meeting today with my editor.

195
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,760
What? Didn't you get fired from your job?

196
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,880
Well, it's a new one.

197
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,990
I'll be busy for a while.

198
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,640
I might even have to stay over at the editor's place once in a while.

199
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,400
This happened overnight?

200
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,350
I got contacted about it coincidentally.

201
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,200
Are you... lying to me?

202
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
It's not a lie.

203
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,730
No, staying over is just weird.

204
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
You're not taking on some shady work, are you?

205
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,220
Of course not.

206
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,360
Yoh.

207
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,730
Yes?

208
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,930
Sit here.

209
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,190
- Okay.
- Now.

210
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,020
Do you understand your current situation?

211
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,300
You don't, do you?

212
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,350
That's why you're talking about working there overnight.

213
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,230
I'm not going there for fun.

214
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,420
That's not the problem.

215
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,980
Aw, jeez.

216
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,290
Is it money?

217
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,821
I'll buy you whatever you want.

218
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,721
It's not that.

219
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:45,190
I just feel like I need to earn a bit of money on my own.

220
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,750
You don't have to. Why don't you get that?

221
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,430
You don't have to make money.

222
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,740
But...

223
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,440
Hey.

224
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,670
I don't care if you lose your manga job.

225
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,200
What?

226
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,130
Of course, I don't.

227
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,722
So don't do anything stupid.

228
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,850
What? You don't care?

229
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,160
Even though you don't know about manga, I thought you supported my work.

230
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,670
Even if it's stupid to you,

231
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,890
it's really, really important to me.

232
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,010
This really sucks.

233
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,788
Don't look down on me.

234
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:37,640
I promise I'm going to make more than you.

235
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,340
With my manga.

236
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,030
Hey, Yoh.

237
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,280
Calm down a second.

238
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,937
Hey.

[SEARCHING]

240
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,970
Hey, Yoh.

241
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,460
Calm down a second.

242
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,490
[SEARCHING]

243
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,640
♫ I accidentally think back to that day and
my chest tightens painfully ♫

244
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,010
♫ If this feeling has a name ♫

245
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,800
♫ Why don't you tell me about it, so I can understand? ♫

246
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,480
♫ A sultry night that seems endless ♫

247
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,550
♫ I hope I will get through it alone ♫

248
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,250
♫ The more you put it into words ♫

249
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:28,420
♫ The more my heart vanishes ♫

250
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,880
♫ I want you to feel the body warmth that touches you ♫

251
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,530
♫ The time we spend together ♫

252
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:44,920
♫ I had hoped it would last forever ♫

Actually, we had a fight as I was leaving.

254
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,870
Something came up, so I came to get Yoh.

255
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,131
What's your name?

256
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,001
Oh, I'm Yoh. It means "leaf".

257
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,660
Yoh-kun, huh? I'm...

258
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,870
Mizuki-san?
