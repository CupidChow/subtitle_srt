13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,360
The two protagonists are a girls' manga artist and a newscaster.

14
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,820
As for the story from college...

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,920
Dayo-chan, are you okay?

16
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:26,430
Actually, we had a fight as I was leaving.

17
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,160
What happened?

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,160
He said he doesn't care what I do for work.

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,880
Segasaki-san said that?

20
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,160
How could he be so dismissive?

21
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,920
But I'm working so hard at it.

22
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,670
He's the worst.

23
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,330

"Even if you lose your job as a manga artist,

Don't worry."

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,650
No, you're just interpreting it how you want it to be.

28
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,240
Dayo-kun, words are 90% about how we interpret things.

29
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,790
Words can mean different things

30
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,940
based on emotions and the situation.

31
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,410

32
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,580
No, it wouldn't have.

33
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,300
He and I aren't like that.

34
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,240
Oh, I forgot.

35
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,020
Right? I already got a bit sleepy.

36
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,450
I even fell asleep.

37
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,920
Yeah.

38
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,980
Huh? You slept, right?

39
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,980
That's because I'm broke.

40
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,790

41
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,300
Right.

42
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,280
When I first saw him,

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,440
I thought he might not be from this planet.

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,480
Or at least, out of all the shapes I've seen on this earth,

45
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,340
he was the most attractive.

46
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,130
The shape of his ears,

47
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,910
the bridge of his nose,

48
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,040
his jawline,

49
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,530
and his soft lips.

50
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,760
I thought that even the shape of his eyeballs

51
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,370
was probably nice.

52
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,580
I hurriedly bought a sketchbook and pencil at the school store.

53
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,410
I drew manga as a hobby,

54
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,140
but I had never drawn a real person before.

55
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,400
- Right, same for me.
- I'd like to see the notes again.

56
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,040
And I had never wanted to draw a man before.

57
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I was driven by a strong desire...

58
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,040
to burn his image into my mind and draw it.

59
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,120
I was in the same space as that beautiful face.

60
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,160
That's probably what made me crazy.

61
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,900
Oh, there you are, Mizuki!

62
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,990
Hey!

63
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,590
What's up?

64
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,200
Can I borrow your notes?

65
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,230
- Again?
- What?

66
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,960
- Thanks to Mizuki...
- You were saved, right?

67
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,680
Is that loner looking at us?

68
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,180
Maybe he wants friends.

69
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,560
Does he think we'll call him over if he stares?

70
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,700
There's no way.

71
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,590
It's not like he's bothering us. I think it's fine.

72
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,770
If he were a girl,

73
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,710
I probably would've fallen head over heels for him.

74
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:09,810
But he was just a good-looking man,

75
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:14,700
so my brain couldn't process it to that extent.

76
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,347
Huh? It's the loner.

77
00:08:07,347 --> 00:08:10,657
Oh, you're right, it's the loner.

78
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,060
- Huh?
- He's always staring at us.

79
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,560
Come here. Let's have a chat.

80
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,520
Is Emi or Chiharu your type?

81
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,320
I'm kinda thirsty.

82
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,100
I'll go buy some drinks.

83
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,620
This is a million times better than getting in a fight.

84
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,150
Thanks. I'll have a milk tea.

85
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,630
I'll have rooibos tea.

86
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,030
Get my tea too.

87
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,700
Me too. What about you, Mizuki?

88
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,100
I'm good.

89
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,697
Get us some snacks too.

90
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:49,940
I can't believe he offered like that.

91
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,151
Seriously.

92
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:53,881
They're all jerks.

93
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,350
I figured it'd be too heavy.

94
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,740
Huh?

95
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,232
I'll hold it.

96
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:08,520
Thank you.

97
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,020
Let's go.

98
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:25,657
You're a pretty slow walker.

99
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,648
I get that a lot.

100
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,710
What's your name?

101
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,100
Oh, I'm Yoh. It means "leaf".

102
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,710

103
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,540

- Mizuki-san, right?

104
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,540
How did you know?

105
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,200
Oh, I heard people call you that.

106
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,820
I'm surprised you heard that.

107
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,780
Right.

108
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,829
Are you having fun?

109
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:02,860
What? Well...

110
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,620
You know, being sent on an errand.

111
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,910
How is it?

112
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,430
No, it's not fun.

113
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,570
What about you?

114
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,400
- Me?
- Yes.

115
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,830
It's not fun at all.

116
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,590
That's a secret.

117
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,060
Okay.

118
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,650
Does he remember?

119
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,000
Certainly.

120
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,460
That's weird.

121
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,270
Sorry, Yoh-kun's stomach is aching,

122
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,020
so I'll walk him home. Here you are.

123
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,630
What? You don't have to go, do you?

124
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,040
I'd feel bad sending him home alone like this.

125
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,140
See you later.

126
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,740
Let's go.

127
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,111
Mizuki is so nice.

128
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,631
But he just left.

129
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,200
Um, are you sure that's fine?

130
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,940
Did you want to go back?

131
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,400
No.

132
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,080
He's always surrounded by friends,

133
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,670
I couldn't understand why he was walking with someone like me.

134
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,735
It was strange.

135
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,940
It'll be raining tomorrow.

136
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
How do you know?

137
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,350
Do you see the vapor trail from that airplane?

138
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,900
Yes.

139
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,570
That's been there for a while.

140
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,090
When that happens, it rains the next day.

141
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,060
Wow.

142
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,120
When low pressure comes close,

143
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,500
the air gets humid, making the vapor last longer.

144
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,890
His face was unbelievably close to mine.

145
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,420
I could hear his voice ringing in my ear.

146
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,040
I realized that I liked it.

147
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,590
Honestly, he scared me.

148
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,980
My heart would jump whenever he was near.

149
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,668
I didn't want him to come over to me.

150
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,890
We lived in different worlds,

151
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,870
so I didn't want him to like me.

152
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,510
But...

153
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,080
This is interesting.

154
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,480
Huh?

155
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,420
- Thank you.
- Tell me what you thought about it then.

156
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,200
I thought I might die if he hated me.

157
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,220
Just imagining the thought upset my stomach.

158
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,650
And here, I want to put a line that shows how Segasaki-san feels.

159
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,580
Can you come up with it?

160
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,280
What?

161
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,350
How he feels?

162
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,200
Um, I'm not sure.

163
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,110
His feelings...

164
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,000
His feelings...

165
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,880
What?

166
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,120
Dayo-kun,

167
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,026
how about a small break?

168
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,560
Sure.

169
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,700
So much foam.

170
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:45,670
[Make an excuse and come back right now.]

171
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,760
You seemed troubled.

172
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,160
I haven't put my feelings into words much before.

173
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,370
That goes for other people's feelings too.

174
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,700
Oh, I see.

175
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:06,180
I want to give you advice, but I only draw four-panel manga.

176
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,460
Oh, but, isn't your manga being made into a movie, Atsuya-san?

177
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,250
Yours might too, Dayo-kun.

178
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,080
No, that would never happen.

179
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,070
By the way, is this manga 100% real?

180
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,090
No, it's mostly Man-san's imagination.

181
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,490
Really?

182
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,270
But that's true.

183
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,628
Getting drunk and acting like a kid to your boyfriend doesn't sound like you.

184
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,340
Yeah... I guess.

185
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,840
[Forward]

186
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,900
When I came home last time, you were doing a crazy pose.

187
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,130
Oh, this?

188
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,830
This was for Man-san's research.

189
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,240
Oh, I see.

190
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,370
So, in other words, it's like this, right?

191
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,220
Kinda like when you go,

192
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,750
- "Ah!"
- That's right.

193
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,300
- Oh, well, for example...
- Yes?

194
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,960
Let's say I wanted it, but the other person isn't reacting at all.

195
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,310
This is just for my own reference.

196
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,090
[Forward]

197
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,320
Then somehow...

198
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,380
You go like this, and this.

199
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,310
Yes.

200
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,270
And then from this side...

201
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,040
Right?

202
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,070
Coming!

203
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,370
And the cat sees you like this.

204
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,070
Meow!

205
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,930
Kanami-san?

206
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,820
I'll mess you up.

207
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,910
I'll mess you up.

208
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,480
Huh? What? Wait.

209
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,580
Why is he here?

210
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,380
Are you working with him?

211
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,910
[MY FAVORITE IDOL]

212
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,120
I'm sorry for moving forward without telling you.

213
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,150
No, it's not your fault, Kanami-san.

214
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,970
Excuse me.

215
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,669
Something came up, so I came to get Yoh.

216
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:00,920
[This guy is the editor?]

217
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,749
[Don't try to seduce Yoh!]

218
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,305
[How dare he touch You like that!]

219
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:07,991
[Who's this?]

220
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
What?

221
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,820
I didn't want him to find out like this.

222
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,700
Oh, you're Segasaki-san, right?

223
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,400
Nice to meet you, I'm...

224
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,460
You can do the rest remotely, right?

225
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,760
Yes.

226
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,460
Let's go.

227
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,360
Well... Um...

228
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,050
I'm her husband.

229
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,760
Segasaki-san sure is a strong character.

230
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,760
Sorry for not telling you.

231
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,990
Hey.

232
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,890
Yes?

233
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,120
Is that your type?

234
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,810
- What?
- What's so great about that guy?

235
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:42,060
[That guy?]

236
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,850
What? I don't think you should compare yourself.

237
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,320
Of course I should.

238
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,990
What's he got that I don't?

239
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,950
I won't accept it if you don't have a good reason.

240
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:01,500
Well, I guess you could say he's kind.

241
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,180
He listens to everything I have to say.

242
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,080
I see.

243
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,106
I'm heading in first.

244
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:45,480
Huh?

245
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,560
Oh, I returned the thing that was in my bag.

246
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,810
A cloud has formed over the south coast.

247
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,010
The tropical cyclone could become a typhoon,

248
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,150
so please plan accordingly.
[Live weather map from 24th (Monday)]

249
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,460
Segasaki-san.

250
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,760
Yes?

251
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,480
Did you notice anything today?

252
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,210
What could it be?

253
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,300
I'm actually wearing fake glasses.

254
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:55,100
I wanted to look as magnificent as you if I can.

255
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,930
You sure are interesting, Hiyoshi-san.

256
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,590
How do I look with my glasses, everyone?

257
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,260
Please post on social media if you like them.

258
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,940
I'll mess you up.

259
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,800
I'll totally mess you up.

260
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,890
Please be careful regarding the tropical cyclone.

261
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,850
Newscaster Segasaki, are you okay?

262
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,870
♫ I accidentally think back to that day and
my chest tightens painfully ♫

263
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:55,340
♫ If this feeling has a name ♫

264
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,970
♫ Why don't you tell me about it, so I can understand? ♫

265
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,740
♫ A sultry night that seems endless ♫

266
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,760
♫ I hope I will get through it alone ♫

267
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,430
♫ The more you put it into words ♫

268
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,280
♫ The more my heart vanishes ♫

269
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:19,110
♫ I want you to feel the body warmth that touches you ♫

270
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,780
♫ The time we spend together ♫

271
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:30,560
♫ I had hoped it would last forever ♫

272
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,150
[Preview]
Do I look like this?

273
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,030
My smile is better than this.

274
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,510
Hey, what happened all of a sudden?

275
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,780
I'm sorry, he doesn't look well.

276
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,380
Accidentally...

277
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,520
It's sunny in Tokyo today,

278
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,020
and the highest temperature could reach 37 degrees.

279
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,420
We've had three hot days.

280
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,990
But tomorrow, with Typhoon No. 5 approaching,

281
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,010
it's going to be stormy.

282
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,530
The information changes every minute.

283
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,120
Please check our program from time to time.
