The forecast said it was unusually warm that day,

2
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,000
so I dressed warmer than necessary.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,722
I was in a daze.

00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:20,837
That's why I didn't really understand what he was saying.

What?

7
00:00:32,474 --> 00:00:34,204
Like I said,

8
00:00:34,204 --> 00:00:37,172
you should keep doing manga.

9
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:40,008
I can give you food, water, and shelter.

00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:41,981
So, live with me.

00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:46,942
And in exchange...

12
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:51,133
do everything I say.

13
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:56,939

It is currently still raining.

You know the live channel that talks about the weather all day?

00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:35,356
Does anyone else out there watch it all day besides me?

Here's what's on the radar.

34
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:53,063
It'll stop raining in many areas,

35
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:57,234
but the humidity will still haunt the Kanto region.

36
00:02:57,234 --> 00:03:02,840
This will keep the clouds around, causing it to rain in the Tokyo city area.

37

Don't forget your umbrella.

00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,320

49
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:55,681
I like his facial structure the most out of everyone else in the world.

50
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:58,606
It doesn't mean I like Segasaki Mizuki.

51

Why? He's not just a pretty face.

Ever since he joined Everyday Weather, their viewership exploded 100-fold.

54
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,258
I never thought I'd ever support a weatherman.

182
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:25,690
I have to find a job.

183
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:28,280
Hm, but that's no fun.

184
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:33,942
You don't want to quit, right?

185
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:38,084
Yes.

186
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,178
Then...

187
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:45,019
Come live with me.

188
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:47,994
I'm planning on making some good money.

189
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:55,921
What do you say?

190
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,165
What?

191
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:03,274
Like I said,

192
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:06,205
you should keep doing manga.

193
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,126
I can give you food, water, and shelter.

194
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,111
So, live with me.

195
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:17,085
And in exchange...

196
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:21,094
Do everything I say.

197
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:31,701
What do you say?

198
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,878
Three years have passed.

199
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,854
Don't lose your way.

200
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,991
Yoh, I'm coming home late, so I won't need dinner.

201
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,567
Okay.

202
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:48,247
We're here for the next three hours on Everyday Weather. I'm Takatsu Reiko.

203
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:52,485
I'm meteorologist Segasaki Mizuki.

204
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,466
An update from the Meteorological Agency.

205
00:21:56,466 --> 00:22:00,760
Both East and West Japan have entered the rainy season.

206
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,156
Did you know that the type of rain differs in each region,

207
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,834
- even during the rainy season?
- What?

208
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:12,018
- West Japan has heavy showers, 
- It can't be true.

209
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:13,800
while East Japan

210
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,760
has comparatively mild rain.

211
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:21,796
We've adopted a new system.

212
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:27,411
We have improved our ability to check global warming trends.

213
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:30,051
- Next. 
- That means...

214
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:36,212
we won't... do it for a while.

215
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:43,637
I don't have to do it for a while.

216
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,830
♫ I accidentally think back to that day and
my chest tightens painfully ♫

217
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,260
♫ If this feeling has a name ♫

218
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,880
♫ Why don't you tell me about it, so I can understand? ♫

219
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,560
♫ A sultry night that seems endless ♫

220
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,620
♫ I hope I will get through it alone ♫

221
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,290
♫ The more you put it into words ♫

222
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,810
♫ The more my heart vanishes ♫

223
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:18,940
♫ I want you to feel the body warmth that touches you ♫

224
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,650
♫ The time we spend together ♫

225
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:30,640
♫ I had hoped it would last forever ♫

226
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:33,928
[Preview]
It's been a while, isn't it?

227
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:35,777
You don't have to do it for a while.

228
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:37,770
Are you working overtime today?

229
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,443
Hey, what is it, tell me, what is it?

230
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:43,856
Open-chested clothes every time!

231
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,442
Is this some sort of erotic disaster?

232
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:48,475
I can't help it!

233
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:50,712
Don't take it for granted.

234
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:55,453
You don't love me. I am only a convenient tool to you.

235
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:59,853
I've never been laughed at like that.
