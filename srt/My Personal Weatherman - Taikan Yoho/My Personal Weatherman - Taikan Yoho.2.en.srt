Both east and west Japan have entered the rainy season.

00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:11,035
- Right, rainy season.
- The rain differs in each region.

00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:14,565
That means...

we won't...

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,690
do it for a while.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,930
More than ever because of global warming.

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,702

15
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,245
Even during the rainy season, it might get sunny on some days.

16
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:34,114
Besides, you never know. He might break that strange rule.

17
00:01:34,114 --> 00:01:38,514
He might start something if he's feeling horny.

Starting from next week's broadcast, Hiyoshi Aika-san will be the new newscaster.

25
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:06,634
She's 22 years old!

26
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:11,913
I'm sure she'll be able to give a breath of fresh air to our program.

Thank you so much.

28
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:15,877
Thank you.

00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:54,795
Hey.

31
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,796
Oh, sorry. I'll warm up dinner.

32
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,600
I told you I wouldn't need any.

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,003
What?

34
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,004
What?

35
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,802
Oh, you're right.

36
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:16,476
I forgot.

37
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:20,474
What's wrong?

38
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:23,239
It's nothing.

39
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:31,944
What'd you make?

40
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:36,799
Meat and potatoes.

41
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:40,317
I see.

42
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,897
I'll have some.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,247
But didn't you eat already?

44
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:03,075
Seeing you eat is making me hungry.

45
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,642
I see.

46
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,584
What're you doing?

47
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,288
What? I wanted to get you a plate.

48
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,386
No, we'd just have more dishes to wash.

49
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:19,706
- What?
- Just sit.

50
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:30,485
Hey.

51
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:33,318
Feed me.

52
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:37,121
Oh, sure.

53
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:52,500
Do slaves usually do stuff like this too?

54
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:56,014
Give me another bite.

The only thing good about him is his face.

56
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,052
Hm?

57
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,320
Oh, no...

58
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,110
It's nothing.

59
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:28,801
I see.

60
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,301
Yeah.

61
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,702
No matter how you look at it, he ate way too much.

62
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:44,093
He even ate most of my share.

63
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:52,451
Well, I guess I'm okay with it.

64
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,468
He has an early morning again tomorrow,

65
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,120
I guess.

66
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:43,211
Um...

67
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,532
Hello?

68
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:04,997
You should sleep in your room.

69
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,914
Sure.

70
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:12,115

Okay.

00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:43,917
After all that he ate today?

78
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,708
This doesn't make sense.

Let's talk about the weather.

86
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:30,599
There are rain clouds from west Japan to east Japan.

87
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,001
The seasonal rain front this year remains in the Honshu area.

88
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,109
Rain will be more frequent,

89
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:43,605
and the Kanto region will continue to have a lack of sun.

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,100
[I'll be late again today.]

91
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,304
He's been coming home late.

92
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:23,180
Of course,

93
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,040
that means he doesn't touch me.

94
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,197
The day simply ends.

95
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:41,023
Yoh.

96
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,832
I'll be late again.

97
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:47,091
- Okay.
- Cool.

98
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,889
The rain spell just won't end.

99
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,389
That's true.

100
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,047
Because of the rainy season,

101
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:05,967
I've been working on creating different dipping sauces.

102
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:09,495
What kind of different sauces have you made?

103
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:12,121
Well, one I've really liked recently

104
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:15,355
is this sauce that uses tofu with a little bit of chili oil

105
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:17,861
rather than just dashi and soy sauce.

106
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:19,867
It's a Chinese variation, which tastes great.

107
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:21,874
That's so creative.

108
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:23,667
That sounds really tasty.

109
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:27,209
- Thanks for the food.
- When it comes to flavors...

110
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:06,358
No.

111
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:15,549
Stop being so flirty.

112
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:20,959
Can we talk about this mini-segment?

113
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,856
It gets humid during the rainy season and mold grows more easily.

114
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:29,976
They say that the word for rainy season, tsuyu, originates from the word for mold.

115
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:33,369
Maybe it would be helpful for viewers if we added that.

116
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:34,609
Oh, sounds good.

117
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,615
Then let's add that too.

118
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:39,853
I think we can squeeze it in.

119
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:42,345
Okay, I'll work on it once the script's ready.

120
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:43,485
That was helpful.

121
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,538
- Thanks.
- Yes.

122
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:50,126
Segasaki-san.

123
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,880
Are you working late again?

124
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,050
Dayo-chan.

125
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,186
Yeah?

126
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,966
Hey, what's with that girl?

127
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:03,507
What's with that Hiyoshi Aika?

128
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:05,889
Yeah, she's cute, right?

129
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:08,950
Why's she always showing off her cleavage?

130
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,487
Being an online broadcast doesn't give you a pass.

131
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:14,884
It'd be over for her if it were the public news.

132
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:16,405
Don't laugh!

133
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:20,070
I hate that Segasaki-san's breathing

134
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,360
the same air as her.

135
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,051
Maybe I'll wreak havoc on their live chat.

136
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:30,290
But I'm a pure, innocent Segasaki fan.

137
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,137
Dayo-chan?

138
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,570
Are you listening?

139
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,757
Dayo-chan.

140
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,613
I can't do this anymore.

141
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:45,898
I'm so tired of this.

142
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,549
Really? Thank you.

143
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,459
- Hello.
- Oh, you're early, Segasaki.

144
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,660
I'm finally getting comfortable with the new weather analysis system.

145
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,132
I'm jealous.

146
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:04,137
Our old eyes are getting blurry.

147
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:06,704
We've already half given up.

148
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:10,570
It'll be a great tool if we take advantage of all the features.

149
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,358
Apparently. So, what should we do?

150
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,990
Why don't we just call it a day for now?

151
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:18,960
Isn't that right?

152
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,865
Segasaki-san.

153
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:23,023
Have a good night.

154
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,927
Oh, right.

155
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:29,817
We were thinking of having a light meal to welcome Hiyoshi-san to our show.

156
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:32,294
Do you want to come?

157
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,116
Sorry, it's been a while since I got to go home early.

158
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:42,170
I'll be off.

159
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:46,379
I bet someone's waiting for him at home.

160
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,411
His fans are going to cry.

161
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:54,583
Well, I guess that's true.

162
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:05,814
I want food.

163
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:11,641
What the...

164
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,979
Huh?

165
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:23,433
You're home?

166
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:28,675
That's pretty bold of you, when I'm holding myself back here.

167
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,120
No, stop.

168
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,553
Let go of me. Let go!

169
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,153
Hey...

170
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:41,144
I'm so tired of this.

171
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:44,303
What's with this erotic spectacle?

172
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:46,718
Shut up.

173
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,930
I'm going to be

174
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,450
the most popular erotic manga artist out there.

175
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,498
The hell?

176
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,943
Hey.

177
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,835
A popular manga artist...

178
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:05,410
said their work gets better

179
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,590
if they draw while jerking off.

180
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,118
You haven't drawn anything.

181
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:17,332
Hey, I told you to stop.

182
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:23,686
You drank too much.

183
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,400
All you did was jerk off and sleep.

184
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Shut up!

185
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,800
I'll draw...

186
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,720
an erotic manga

187
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,570
people can get off on.

188
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:38,628
I'll make a ton of cash...

189
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:42,621
and leave this place.

190
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:45,938
What? Hey.

191
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:47,680
What're you trying to pull?

192
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,282
It doesn't matter!

193
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:56,788
Don't think you can keep embracing me so nonchalantly.

194
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,056
You...

195
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:02,586
don't even like me.

196
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,248
You just consider me a convenient slave.

197
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:12,610
If you want to have sex,

198
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,260
just do it with that weather forecaster.

199
00:16:16,314 --> 00:16:20,337
What are you going on about?

200
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:28,212
You...

201
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:32,866
have never smiled at me like that before.

202
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:58,683
I'm tired of this.

203
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:03,143
It's tiring being with you.

204
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,258
I hate it.

205
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,774
You...

206
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:22,249
speak a lot when you drink, huh?

207
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,256
Hey.

208
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,908
Why can't we do it when it rains?

209
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:39,550
What?

210
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,870
It's because of what you said.

211
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,295
What?

212
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:47,232
The first time we slept together here...

213
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:18,930
What should we do about the bedsheets?

214
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,587
Will they dry?

215
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:26,271
We only have one sheet.

216
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:31,440
We'll do this

217
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,961
on sunny days from now on.

218
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:35,847
Prepare yourself.

219
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,957
I didn't want you to worry about laundry.

220
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:59,304
I'm a thoughtful guy.

221
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:04,476
We could just buy a dryer.

222
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:10,768
Do you want me that bad?

223
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:14,302
Well, that's...

224
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:17,145
- Um...
- What's with

225
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:19,040
all that stuff you said about me

226
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,740
not liking you or you wanting to leave in the first place?

227
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,398
How can you say that after accepting my proposal?

228
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,407
Pr...

229
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:30,728
Then...

230
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,326
Come live with me.

231
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:37,342
I'm planning on making some good money.

232
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,535
Like I said,

233
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:47,135
you should keep doing manga.

234
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:50,177
I can give you food, water, and shelter,

235
00:19:50,177 --> 00:19:52,245
so live with me.

236
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,375
What?

237
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:57,180
Was it that?

238
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,387
I said I'd support you.

239
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:01,669
Of course, that's a proposal.

240
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,081
I knew it. This guy...

241
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:08,297
This guy really...

242
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:10,392
You're...

243
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:12,852
such an idiot.

244
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:17,716
He really needs to use more words.

245
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:01,160
By the way,

246
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:05,067
does that mean you hate me?

247
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,471
Oh.

248
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:16,859
Well?

249
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,654
I need to say it.

250
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:21,959
I need to say he's wrong.

251
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,457
But...

252
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:29,265
I see.

253
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:41,111
When I'm in front of you,

254
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:45,180
I'm always at a loss for words.

255
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,336
I don't want you to hate me.

256
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:52,094
But in that case,

257
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,623
if I tell him he's wrong,

258
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:59,054
that would mean that I don't hate him.

259
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:00,958
In other words...

260
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,877
No, that's not right either.

261
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:11,913
I don't know what's correct anymore.

262
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,278
Aw, geez.

263
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,270
♫ I accidentally think back to that day ♫

264
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,850
♫ And my chest tightens painfully ♫

265
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,330
♫ If this feeling has a name ♫

266
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,050
♫ Why don't you tell me about it, so I can understand? ♫

267
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,690
♫ A sultry night that seems endless ♫

268
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,750
♫ I hope I will get through it alone ♫

269
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,390
♫ The more you put it into words ♫

270
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,590
♫ The more my heart vanishes ♫

271
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:34,080
♫ I want you to feel the body warmth that touches you ♫

272
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,730
♫ The time we spend together ♫

273
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:45,400
♫ I had hoped it would last forever ♫

274
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,662
[Preview]
Cafe sketches, right?

275
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:49,002
That's not your boyfriend, is it?

276
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:50,515
Cool and handsome.

277
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:51,855
Do you work tomorrow?

278
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:53,598
Either way.

279
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,858
Then I won't go out.

280
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:56,860
It's not about the weather.

281
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,090
We can do it anytime.
