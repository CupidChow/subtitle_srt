00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,980
It's sunny in Tokyo today,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,620
and the highest temperature could reach 37 degrees.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,000
We've had three hot days.

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,930
it's going to be stormy.

00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,270

00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,210

I'm watching his show repeatedly again.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,250
We've lived together for four months,

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,690
- but I can't stop looking at his face.

[EPISODE 7]

00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,830
[My Favorite Idol]

26
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,360
Wow.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,600
Come on, this is the result of our sweat and tears

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,190
after thousands of remote meetings.

29
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,440
Be happier.

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,470
Sorry.

31
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,230
Do you feel sorry for Segasaki-san?

32
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,416
Yeah,

33
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,980
to be honest,

34
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,050
he's been avoiding me lately.

35
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,910
I think he wasn't too happy about us writing this manga.

36
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,310
The love you two have is packed into here.

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,010
Have him read it.

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,980
No, I want to wait for him to just forget about it.

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,680
I'm going to hide these in my bag until we sell them.

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,180
I wonder if that guy's still meeting with that editor.

41
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,587
I didn't see him leave this morning, so I'm sure it's fine.

42
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,530
But, wait. Why am I acting so worried?

43
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,420
That's really annoying.

44
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,035
After all, I'm the only one he's willing to sleep with.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,800
Has he ever smiled that way for me?

46
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,750
Oh, welcome back.

47
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,993
Who's he texting?

48
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,590
Are you okay?

49
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,900
Yeah.

50
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,600
Are you not feeling well?

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,440
It was really hot today.

52
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,190
I'm okay.

53
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,420
Anything you want to eat?

54
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,170
I'll go get some groceries.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,700
It's fine.

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,840
I see.

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,883
He's not thinking of going out, is he?

58
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,190
- Thanks to Mizuki...
- You were saved, right?

59
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,860
Is that loner looking at us?

60
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,350
Maybe he wants friends.

61
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,940
In college, I only hung around with trash.

62
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,220
And nothing will happen to me, so I guess it's fine.

63
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,785
Ugh, but that kind of behavior is so creepy.

64
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,079
They'd diss over people out loud

65
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,810
and get all excited over nothing.

66
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,400
It's okay, they don't take attendance in information tech.

67
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,090
Since then, whenever I was in the cafeteria,

68
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,750
I'd feel someone watching me.

69
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,870
It wasn't a glare.

70
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,900
It wasn't a passionate stare either.

71
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,430
It felt like I was being observed.

72
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,460
I thought it was cowardly.

73
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,060
Abandoning any obligation to mix in with the community

74
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,050
and hiding in his own world...

75
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,390
Watching him annoyed me.

76
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,290
- Let's see.
- We'll practice first.

77
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,210
Yeah, practice...

78
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,140
- Then we go to karaoke later.
- Yeah, right.

79
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,670
I'll get it.

80
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,050
- I'll get it.
- What to do?

81
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,060
- I want to go to the sea.
- The sea?

82
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,190
I want to get fireworks.

83
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,690
That's impossible, right?

84
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,580
Sorry. Really sorry.

85
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm going to the restroom.

86
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,000
I figured it'd be too heavy.

87
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,200
I didn't want to be grouped with those guys,

88
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,970
so I figured I'd show him some kindness.

89
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,870
It all started on a whim.

90
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,230
What's your name?

91
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,500
Oh, I'm Yoh. It means "leaf".

92
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,741
- Wow, Yoh-kun, huh?
- Yes.

93
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:24,170
For some reason, I felt at ease around Yoh.

94
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,790
I was tempted. I felt an urge.

95
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,970
And just being watched was annoying.

96
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,519
That's all it was, but...

97
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,950
Good morning.

98
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Oh, hello.

99
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,550
What are you always drawing?

100
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,300
Can you show me?

101
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,360
Huh?

102
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,860
Okay, here.

103
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,590
Thanks.

104
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,930
His drawings were good enough for art school.

105
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,650
But...

106
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,300
Hey,

107
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,580
do I look like this?

108
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,300
What?

109
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,710
Well...

110
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,280
It's practice for taking a quick look

111
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,620
at a model and taking in

112
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,400
their features and ambiance.

113
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,100
You're really talented. Thanks for showing me.

114
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,050
Okay.

115
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,980
My smile is better than this.

116
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,070
You did it!

117
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,960
I want Mizuki to do a speech at my wedding as my best man.

118
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,150
I think of you as my best friend.

119
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,780
I'll write something good.

120
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,400
Then I'll get married to Mizuki.

121
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,440
You keep teasing me.

122
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,421
- I'm not teasing you.
- Me too, then.

123
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:06,350
I fine-tune my facial muscles,

124
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,000
and push down my true feelings.

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,460
I avoided trouble,

126
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,470
and lived life carefully.

127
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,340
Even then.

128
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,840
You keep teasing me.

129
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,510
- I'm not teasing you.
- Me too, then.

130
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,729
Me too, then.

131
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,300
- Um...
- It's the loner!

132
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,970
- You scared me.
- Excuse me.

133
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,690
Sorry.

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,700
Hey!

135
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,740
What is this all of a sudden?

136
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,530
Oh, sorry.

137
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,020
You looked really uncomfortable, so...

138
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,846
What?

139
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:52,370
I saw you as I was passing by.

140
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,310
Are you okay?

141
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,020
You're burning up.

142
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,900
You need to lie down somewhere. In the student health center?

143
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,040
It's fine. I live nearby.

144
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,730
- Want your friends?
- No,

145
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,550
being with them wears me out.

146
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,680
I never had a friend I could be myself around.

147
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,250
I never found anyone that seemed worth it to me.

148
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,800
Shall I take it off?

149
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,820
Don't look. Those feelings were a secret.

150
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,970
No one's found out. But I'm tired.

151
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,810
Are you sure I shouldn't call anyone?

152
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,478
Like your parents?

153
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,121
Yeah, I'm fine.

154
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,220
Are you sure?

155
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,318
Um, I'll be off then.

156
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,721
Don't go.

157
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,400
Huh?

158
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,958
Don't leave.

159
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,370
Can I go get you a sports drink?

160
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,490
Or if you need anything else...

161
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,390
I'm hungry.

162
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,990
Oh, I'll go buy something you can warm up and eat.

163
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,110
I don't want instant food.

164
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,950
What?

165
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,800
Maybe it's the fever talking.

166
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,120
Or maybe I relaxed a bit after my true feelings were seen.

167
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,540
Maybe it's his seemingly absentminded vibe.

168
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,970
I know nothing but his name,

169
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,990
so what is this?

170
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,740
This weakening feeling...

171
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,900
Oh, how are you feeling?

172
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,806
So-so.

173
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,780
Oh, right, something to drink.

174
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,960
Which one would you like?

175
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,300
Anything is fine.

176
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,330
I see.

177
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,300
Curry.

178
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,728
Yes, it's curry.

179
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,703
Did you make it?

180
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:45,928
What?

181
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,897
But you said you were hungry.

182
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,300
Oh, right.

183
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,050
Oh, sorry.

184
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,730
I've only made curry before.

185
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,771
No, it's okay.

186
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,674
Thank you.

187
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,420
Man, this is crazy.

188
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:00,910
Usually, when someone's sick, you'd make them porridge or something.

189
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,970
Oh, sorry.

190
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,300
No,

191
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,830
this is fine.

192
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,770
I'm feeling much better.

193
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,450
Put this in some Tupperware.

194
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,390
- What?
- I'll eat it all.

195
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:29,260
- Okay.
- You'd better not eat any.

196
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,730
Okay.

197
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,830
This is mine.

198
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:57,160
I'm the only one who has to know that this curry tastes bad.

199
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,900
He did his best to make it.

200
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,930
That made me happy.

201
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,907
That fact is all I need.

202
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Sorry,

203
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,000
I suddenly had you take care of me.

204
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,300
Oh, it's fine.

205
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,290
He's slow, clumsy,

206
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,450
somewhat off-beat, and absentminded.

207
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,853
But I liked that.

208
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,495
I liked that...

209
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,240
about you.

210
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,670
What?

211
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,461
- Huh?
- You're right.

212
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,660
It's Mizuki.

213
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,400
Did you need something?

214
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,580
I came for a breather.

215
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,269
The air is nice here.

216
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,750
That's okay, right? I won't bother you.

217
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,880
Okay.

218
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,470
You've got your sketchpad, right? Draw me if you want.

219
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,270
I'm right in front of you now.

220
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,444
Take a good look.

221
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,140
The drawing didn't look much like your face, did it?

222
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,543
What? Oh, the drawing of my face?

223
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,850
No, that's not what I meant.

224
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,586
Okay, then.

225
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,331
- I'll draw you.
- Sure.

226
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:05,610
Draw me well.

227
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,355
I'll do my best.

228
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,300
Draw me more.

229
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,190
The parts deep inside of me

230
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,270
that even I don't know of.

231
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,400
I don't mind it

232
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,300
if you're the one exposing them.

233
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,206
Yoh?

234
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,200
Yoh.

235
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:46,507
I knew the typhoon was coming, but I forgot the laundry.

236
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:49,217
Even though I had to rush out.

237
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,898
You had to rush out?

238
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:01,790
Don't just go out like that.

239
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,646
What? I can't hear you.

240
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,870
I...

241
00:21:09,277 --> 00:21:12,020
I need you.

242
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,741
Or else I can't breathe.

243
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,758
What did you say?

244
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,506
It's dangerous up here.

245
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,221
I'm sorry.

246
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:09,447
What?

247
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:12,800
"Sorry"?

248
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,230
You've never said that before.

249
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,550
It was stupid of me to trust you and leave you like this.

250
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:24,060
Huh? Wait, what?

251
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,160
I didn't want to do this to you.

252
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,520
But I have no choice.

253
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,829
I need to make sure you don't go out on your own.

254
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,320
You look good like this.

255
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,420
What?

256
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,710
♫ I accidentally think back to that day and
my chest tightens painfully ♫

257
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:10,130
♫ If this feeling has a name ♫

258
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,810
♫ Why don't you tell me about it, so I can understand? ♫

259
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,490
♫ A sultry night that seems endless ♫

260
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,550
♫ I hope I will get through it alone ♫

261
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,300
♫ The more you put it into words ♫

262
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,030
♫ The more my heart vanishes ♫

263
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:33,880
♫ I want you to feel the body warmth that touches you ♫

264
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,590
♫ The time we spend together ♫

265
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:45,550
♫ I had hoped it would last forever ♫

266
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,010
[Preview]
You look good like this.

267
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,550
Stay away from girls and other guys.

268
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,750
Don't look, talk, or smile at them.

269
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,130
You can't escape from me.

270
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,790
Hey.

271
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,932
How do I make you mine and mine alone?
