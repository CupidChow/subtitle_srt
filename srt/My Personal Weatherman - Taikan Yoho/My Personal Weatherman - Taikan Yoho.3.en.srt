- He's a radiant type. A real hottie.
- He's not bad.

41
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:51,888
The way he acts in public is as impressive as always.

42
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:56,747
It's great you want to practice, but some people hate being stared at.

50

So, you know, I think it needs to convey an emotional connection.

51

Instead of using words,

58
00:04:56,646 --> 00:05:03,034
I try to express these things by using my character's actions and expressions,

59
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,714
the contour and shading,

60
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:08,559
- and their breath and gaze.
- Okay.

Sorry.

187
00:13:45,722 --> 00:13:49,505
It's indeed like a date, huh?

188
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:03,124
Welcome.

189
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:04,724
Hello.

190
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:16,305
Oh, now I get it.

191
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:20,455
He just wanted me to hold his bags.

192
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:22,730
Are you looking for something?

193
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,924
Oh, um, well...

194
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:30,072
I think this would look good on you.

195
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:35,156
It's a loose fit, but it works for both, casual and more formal occasions.

196
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:37,723
And it goes with any pants.

197
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:42,091
That's great, but doesn't this suit you too?

198
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:45,030
What do you think?

199
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,848
I'm not sure.

200
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:51,666
I don't know much about clothes.

201
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,920
I think it looks good.

202
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,922
I'll buy it for you.

203
00:14:57,685 --> 00:15:00,516
Oh, it's fine.

204
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,316
Thanks.

205
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:11,043
Having fun?

206
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,162
Yeah, I guess.

207
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:23,050
Um, I don't mind if you have other places to be.

208
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:26,452
What?

209
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:31,372
I'm just saying it's fine,

210
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:34,739
since I'm enjoying myself.

211
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:39,884
It's not fun hanging out with a guy you hate on your precious day off?

212
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:43,441
No, that's not...

213
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,042
That's...

214
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,864
I see.

215
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:58,768
I forgot I have plans. Meet back here at five.

216
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:00,347
What?

217
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:58,652
Let's go home.

218
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,152
Okay.

219
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:05,684
To be honest, this whole time,

220
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:08,841
his small facial expressions, his mannerisms,

221
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:12,801
the way he seems a bit happy when I say something,

222
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:15,997
his kind voice when he says it'll be a sunny day,

223
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:18,723
all made me feel like an idiot.

224
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:24,601
I hated how I felt that I was the only one whose heart was racing every day.

225
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:29,082
I had to pick up on things to hate about him.

226
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:33,746
Otherwise, I'd lose my breath from these contradicting feelings.

227
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:35,627
I hated it.

228
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,543
But I don't hate you.

229
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,864
I don't!

230
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:00,099
This is for you.

231
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:05,111
I said it's for you. Take it.

232
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:22,274
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:24,492
For what?

234
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:28,811
For different things.

235
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:31,067
But why?

236
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:41,544
I can't convey it through words, so...

237
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,985
Bed sheets?

238
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,180
Yeah.

239
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,299
You got so many spare sheets.

240
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,555
So, what're you saying?

241
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:30,265
You want to do it whenever, even when it's not sunny?

242
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,385
How many did you buy?

243
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,015
Three...

244
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:49,310
and summer sheets, too.

245
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,699
Well done.

246
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:08,873
Could it be... that this guy actually really...

247
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:14,629
Shall we go to bed?

248
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:23,944
Can I believe that?

249
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:48,383
Isn't this great?

250
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:50,671
Since you bought sheets, we can do it a lot now.

251
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:52,936
That sex you love so much.

252
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:03,758
Well, I'm sorry, it's with the guy you hate so much.

253
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,281
You said I can do whatever I want,

254
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:15,756
so that's what I'll do.

255
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,404
Got it?

256
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:29,537
You really are...

257
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:34,897
an idiot.

258
00:22:27,468 --> 00:22:32,827
This guy really likes me, huh?

259
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,944
I can just tell.

260
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:04,780
♫ I accidentally think back to that day and
my chest tightens painfully ♫

261
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:10,180
♫ If this feeling has a name ♫

262
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,860
♫ Why don't you tell me about it, so I can understand?  ♫

263
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,570
♫ A sultry night that seems endless  ♫

264
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,580
♫ I hope I will get through it alone ♫

265
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,390
♫ The more you put it into words ♫

266
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,530
♫ The more my heart vanishes ♫

267
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:34,020
♫ I want you to feel the body warmth that touches you ♫

268
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,730
♫ The time we spend together ♫

269
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:45,300
♫ I had hoped it would last forever ♫

270
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,334
[PREVIEW]
Hey, Dayo-chan.

271
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:49,118
What do you listen to when you work?

272
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:51,743
An online stream called "Everyday Weather".

273
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:53,815
Wait, is this reality?

274
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,517
Am I really in the place where Segasaki-san lives,

275
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:59,968
breathing the same air as him?
