That sounds just like him.

181
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,754
Yeah, and since then, we got along really well.

182
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:37,353
He helps with my manga a lot, too.

183
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:59,349
Oh, is he asleep?

184
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,826
I figured he drank a lot.

185
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:03,654
Time to wrap up, then.

186
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:05,554
I guess so.

187
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:14,751
Yoh.

188
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:17,299
Let's go to bed.

189
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:19,367
No, I won't.

190
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,772
Go if you want to sleep.

191
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,836
I'm not sleeping.

192
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:35,803
Oh, sorry for intruding.

193
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:39,164
No, this drunkard just requires some care.

194
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:46,894
It really does look like you two are dating.

195
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:49,315
It finally feels real.

196
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:52,094
You think so?

197
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:01,997
I didn't know he was such a baby in front of his boyfriend.

198
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:03,517
I'm a bit surprised.

199
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:06,840
No, that's how he gets when he's drunk.

200
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,310
He usually acts cold.

201
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,070
Oh, that's true.

202
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,322
He's not very honest with himself. He always acts on the contrary.

203
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:16,140
It's hard to deal with, isn't it?

204
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,536
Oh, I don't know.

205
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:24,340
It's cute how he has trouble showing how he really feels.

206
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:27,615
Isn't it?

207
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:37,288
I'm sorry for acting like I know your relationship.

208
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,819
What's wrong?

209
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:46,530
I'll take my leave now.

210
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:51,130
Yoh, I'm taking Kanami-san to the station.

211
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:55,449
No, don't go.

212
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,787
Hey, Yoh.

213
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,324
Yoh?

214
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:09,075
You don't have to walk me there.

215
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:12,507
I'll have my husband come get me.

216
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,175
Sorry.

217
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:20,783
Yoh.

218
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:43,756
Yoh, stop drinking.

219
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:46,400
No.

220
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,902
You keep saying "no".

221
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:52,515
Are you in your rebellious phase?

222
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,758
Stop it already.

223
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,719
Stop what?

224
00:16:58,657 --> 00:17:02,888
I like Man-san a lot.

225
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,942
What did you say?

226
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,536
I hate you.

227
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,807
What's with that laugh?

228
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,137
Why'd you sit by her so calculatingly?

229
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:31,253
Why'd you speak so casually to her?

230
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,771
Stop messing around!

231
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:44,214
I thought...

232
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,452
you liked me.

233
00:17:52,353 --> 00:17:54,053
So...

234
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,921
that's what you didn't like?

235
00:18:00,468 --> 00:18:03,460
Is that what you thought?

236
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,247
This is the best.

237
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,843
There, there.

238
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,438
She took you away from me.

239
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,149
I didn't like feeling like this.

240
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:37,365
Especially toward Man-san.

241
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:40,499
She's my friend.

242
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:44,626
I'm such a weakling.

243
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,789
It's so childish.

244
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:50,949
I know I shouldn't like this.

245
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:57,877
But before I knew it, my mind was a mess.

246
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:00,550
I lost control.

247
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:07,114
It's your fault.

248
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:11,710
For whispering like this...

249
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,839
For smiling...

250
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:19,227
For treating me kindly...

251
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:26,916
You're always acting so high and mighty,

252
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,305
telling me to do this and that.

253
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:36,577
Yet suddenly, you're acting like a lover.

254
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:43,117
Anyone would misunderstand.

255
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,037
Could it be...

256
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:51,510
that love...

257
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:57,023
usually feels this shameful?

258
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:44,469
What's wrong?

259
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,867
Are you okay?

260
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:49,641
Yeah, somewhat.

261
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:56,682
Must've been rough.

262
00:20:56,682 --> 00:21:00,570
Segasaki-san was a tough opponent.

263
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,902
When he asserted his dominance, that was such a rush.

264
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:07,528
Sounds like a great experience.

265
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:08,950
Yeah.

266
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,462
By the way, I asked him something when I left.

267
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:17,061
Since I brought a gift, can I ask a question?

268
00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:18,117
Huh?

269
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:21,450
What made you fall for Dayo?

270
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,862
Oh, well...

271
00:21:27,574 --> 00:21:32,058
It's because the first curry that he made for me tasted awful.

272
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,490
What?

273
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,493
What does that mean?

274
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:40,321
Maybe he was avoiding my question.

275
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:43,700
But with a smile like that,

276
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,858
I couldn't say anything back.

277
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:05,154
Yoh.

278
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:11,591
Hey, Yoh.

279
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:19,566
You're hugging me for once, huh?

280
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:23,862
You should stay drunk.

281
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,536
This reminds me

282
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:34,388
of that curry...

283
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,293
I wish I could eat it again.

[Preview]
Sorry, I can't turn my work around.

295
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,592
I got it irregularly since I was a student.

296
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:43,726
He lost his job and was unemployed.

297
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,880
Hey, Yoh.

298
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,097
This is...

299
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:50,265
You look like a real lover.

300
00:23:50,265 --> 00:23:51,802
Are you feeling down?

301
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:55,372
Mangas are no good.

302
00:23:55,372 --> 00:23:57,332
It's not about the world.

303
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:59,487
What do you want to do?

00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:01,087
What?

305
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,591
Do you want to do it?
