1
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,000
Are you really human,

2
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,020
W sorting through

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,980
what

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,400
are involved as

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,560
providing

6
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:52,900
a

7
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,400
Â¢

8
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,000
button

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,320
I can't see or hear or walk away from you.

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,560
Why did I beg you?

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,000
The hands are shaking.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
The flowers are in full bloom.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Will you save me?

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,480
Do you think I will save you like this?

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,320
Don't you want to know

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,800
what my relationship with Zhao Ying is?

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,920
If you save me, I'll tell you.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,160
The night is empty.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,880
The next life is fierce.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,440
Okay.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
Who can stop time?

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,080
The time is empty.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,560
The heart is empty.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,920
Wait a minute, Zheng.

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
Give him some medicine.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,440
Bring him here.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,240
Okay, boss.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,640
I can't see or hear or walk away from you.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,800
The wound still hurts.

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,320
Memories are still in danger.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
There are two endings.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,400
No matter if you understand or not.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me believe in the night.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:15,440
I can't see or hear or walk away from you.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,400
The night is empty.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,680
The smile is still in my hubris.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,320
Is there something I can't see or hear?

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Oh, it's you.

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Hello, boss.

40
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
The waiter at the bar put the wrong medicine.

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
What?

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
You...

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
What did you put in his medicine?

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Well...

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
The drug is harmless to your health.

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
We just need you to take care of him.

47
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Call the boss.

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Miss, come down.

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Kai.

50
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
It's you.

51
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Where did you split up?

52
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
I went to the reception desk to ask.

53
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
He disappeared when I came back.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Where did you go?

55
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Kai.

56
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Help me.

57
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Help me.

58
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
Kai.

59
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Miss.

60
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Miss.

61
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Oh

62
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Oh

63
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Oh

64
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Oh

65
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
I

66
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Oh

67
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
You can tell me now, right?

68
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,900
Tell me.

69
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,240
What's your relationship with Zhao Yan?

70
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,700
If you find Zhao Yan for me, I'll tell you.

71
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,820
Dr. Gu, are you still dreaming?

72
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,440
Yesterday in the bar,

73
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
it was you who forced me to do that.

74
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

75
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,320
You said that. Do you have any evidence?

78
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Although I'm not very intelligent, I still recorded the video of you helping me to follow me.

79
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,320
If I hand this video to the police, will it cause you some trouble?

80
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Don't forget, you're in my house now. How can I let you go to the police?

81
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Do you think you can get out of here?

82
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
I told Weiwei before we went to the bar yesterday.

83
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I didn't go home for more than 12 hours.

84
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
She will call the police.

85
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Are you threatening me?

86
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
So what if I am?

87
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Brother.

88
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Brother.

89
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Hello, Brother.

90
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Give me back my phone.

91
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Did anyone tell you not to call another man when you're talking to a man?

92
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Give it back.

93
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Give it back.

94
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Give it back.

95
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
I won't give it back.

96
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
The video is going to be deleted anyway.

97
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
What are you doing?

98
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Why are you here?

99
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
I heard from Zheng that you drank too much last night.

100
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I came to see you.

101
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I brought you some soup.

102
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Does your head still hurt?

103
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
I'm sorry.

104
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
I'm sorry.

105
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Let me disappear in the dark

106
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
I can't see who's hiding behind

107
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
There are still pain in the wound

108
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Memories are not heavy

109
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
There are two endings

110
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,320
No matter if you understand

111
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Let me disappear in the dark

112
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I can't see who's hiding behind

113
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
There are still pain in the wound

114
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
A snowstorm in front of me

115
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,320
There is no use in living in the end

116
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Let me disappear in the dark

117
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,320
I can't see who's hiding behind

118
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Let me disappear in the dark

119
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,320
I can't see who's hiding behind
