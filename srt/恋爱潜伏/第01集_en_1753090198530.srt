Episode 16

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,600
Is it me who help you take off your clothes

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,440
or you take it off yourself?

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,640
Whatever.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,280
I'll just take it as a dog bite.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,080
You're tough,

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,520
but you're weak.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Welcome to Taichung.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,280
You're on the edge.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
We're reshaping the route.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Hello, Ani.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,360
The location you gave me is not good.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,720
Are you sure I'm going to Taichung?

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,440
Come back quickly.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,600
Don't get close to Taichung.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,240
Hello.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,360
And you test whether the dog bite is good.

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,020
Mister.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There's a pulse.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No wound.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Then these bloods aren't hers.

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
What are you doing?

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Let go.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,180
The

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
We found the suit.

26
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,040
We're looking for the main lady here.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,680
I...

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,960
If you don't want to say anything,

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,240
just kill me.

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Don't bother me.

31
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,360
Zhen Xiang.

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
This is the Pterodactyl.

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,880
If you don't want to die, press the button.

34
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,560
I want you dead.

35
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,920
For whom?

36
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,440
ThatÃ¡no!

37
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,960
It is fuckinÃ­ hard to kill.

38
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,880
You should die.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let go of me.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Shut up.

41
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,680
I'll kill you if you move.

42
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,040
Did you find that woman?

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
No. What about you?

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I didn't find her either.

45
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
Let's go inside and look for her.

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,280
K's body is still inside.

47
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Don't go looking for her.

48
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Let's go first.

49
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Go.

50
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Go.

51
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Go.

52
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Go.

53
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Go.

54
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Go.

55
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Go.

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Let's go to another place first.

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Go.

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Go.

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Let's go to K's room.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
K ran away.

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Who are you?

62
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Who are you?

63
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Tell me.

64
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
K ran away to save you.

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Then they caught you here.

66
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Save me?

67
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Or you want to kill me?

68
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
You had an external injury.

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
If I didn't do that, you would die.

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,520
I remember the way I was kidnapped.

71
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Let me go.

72
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
I'll take you out.

73
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
There are criminals outside.

74
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Follow me if you don't want to die.

75
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
Criminal?

76
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
They are here.

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Hurry up.

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Search.

79
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
Where is the criminal?

80
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
The criminal.

81
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Let's go to another room.

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Go.

83
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Go.

84
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
Stay here and don't move.

85
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Are you okay?

86
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Go.

87
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Go.

88
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Don't move.

89
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Put down your guns.

90
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Yes.

91
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Great.

92
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
You saved so many people.

93
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
You are late.

94
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
If I didn't help you,

95
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
you think you can still live

96
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,040
if you save the people outside?

97
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
If I didn't let them catch you,

98
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
you think you can still live?

99
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
How dare you rob our goods?

100
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
You want to die?

101
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Take care of everyone here.

102
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Yes, Brother Kun.

103
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
This girl is good.

104
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,040
I found your badge in the car outside.

105
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Gu Nian.

106
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
The international medical team.

107
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
It's troublesome to keep it.

108
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
I wanted to keep it for fun.

109
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Let's kill her.

110
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Wait.

111
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
I saved you.

112
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
You saved the wrong person.

113
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
She is a drug dealer.

114
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Since you provoked me,

115
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I'll leave it to you.

116
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
No.

117
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm a doctor.

118
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I'm useful to you.

119
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I'll do it.

120
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,040
What is the song that only lasts for a second

121
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,040
and disappears without a trace

122
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Hands in the air,

123
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I break free from the cage in the flower

124
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,320
I can't help but feel the pain and break through the

125
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:27,040
The sky is empty, the wind is coming

126
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Who is so reckless that it continues to be empty and empty

127
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Let me disappear in the dark

128
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,040
I can't see who is hiding behind

129
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,040
There are still pains in the wound, the memories are still not heavy

130
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:58,040
There are two endings, no matter if you understand

131
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Let me disappear in the dark

132
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,040
I can't see who is chasing behind

133
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,040
There are still pains in the heart, the blood is still red in front of the eyes

134
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,040
There is only one ending, no matter if it is useful

135
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Let me disappear in the dark

136
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,040
