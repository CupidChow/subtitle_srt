1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,480
Wait a minute you just want to take advantage of his unconsciousness

4
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,680
I can help you find out where his stuff is. Do you think I need it?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

6
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,560
Brother, don't worry. Now there's only the two of us here. Let me

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Take good care of you. Get out of my way

8
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Don't touch me

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,720
You again

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,880
I'll send it back to the room. I don't need to bother you

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,560
Brother Kun won't let you leave. It's okay. Let's go

13
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Don't forget to promise me

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,720
You need to be very careful with your guard. You should know

15
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Why are you helping me?

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
He doesn't have the ability to let me out

17
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
But you have

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Okay

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
I'll give you a chance

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,720
But if you can't get the stuff back tonight

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,720
I'll sell you

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,720
I'll sell you

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Be careful

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Oh

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Oh

26
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Oh

27
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
How's it going? Did you get the stuff?

28
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Gu Nian

29
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Brother Kai, the boss is looking for you

30
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
What's wrong with you?

31
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
I'm fine

32
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
It's just that I just got back from the hospital

33
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm fine

34
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm fine

35
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm fine

36
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
I'm fine

37
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm fine

38
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm fine

39
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm fine

40
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm fine

41
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm fine

42
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm fine

43
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
I'm fine

44
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
I'm fine

45
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Gu Nian

46
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
This USB

47
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
You found it in Kai's room, right?

48
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Yes

49
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Gu Nian, why did you frame me?

50
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Kai

51
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm not a thief

52
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
You betrayed me

53
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Boss, I didn't betray you

54
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Boss, give him a punishment

55
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
You'll know who sent him

56
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Maybe he's a cop

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
If I'm a cop

58
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
I'll put the account book in my room

59
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Wait for you to find it so easily

60
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
How did the USB appear in your room?

61
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
How did it appear in your room?

62
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
You're useless now

63
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Boss won't trust you anymore

64
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Kun, I've helped you get the USB back

65
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
When can I let go?

66
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Let you go?

67
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Who said I would let you go?

68
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
You lied to me

69
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
You told me to put the USB in Kai's room

70
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
You told me to put the USB in Kai's room

71
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
You'll let me go

72
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
What are you talking about?

73
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
What do you mean I told you?

74
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
So you gave the USB to him

75
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
You framed me

76
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Kai, be careful

77
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Stop arguing

78
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
The chip is missing

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Boss

80
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
How is it possible?

81
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
It's you

82
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
I know

83
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
It must be you

84
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
And you

85
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
You two are playing a game

86
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Kun

87
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
You dare to play tricks on me

88
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I'll kill you

89
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Enough

90
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Get out of here

91
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Boss, you can't let her go

92
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
She dares to play tricks on me

93
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I'm a coward

94
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
I'll teach her

95
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
I'll teach her

96
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
I'll teach her

97
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
I'll teach her

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
I'll teach her

99
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
I'll teach her

100
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Let me go

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Let me go

102
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Let me go

103
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Boss

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
If we let them go

105
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
The chip will be lost

106
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Do you think it's easy for me to take it out?

107
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Dr. Gu

108
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
You're good at acting

109
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Didn't you teach me this?

110
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Kun asked me to give the USB to him tonight

111
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
He wants it

112
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Give it to him

113
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
You don't need me to teach you

114
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
You know how to act

115
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Is it so beautiful that women can act?

116
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
So you think I'm beautiful

117
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Are you okay?

118
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
It's just a small wound

119
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Who are you?

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Are you a good person or a bad person?

121
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Do you think it's important?

122
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Important

123
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
It's very important to me

124
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
I'm sorry

125
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm sorry

126
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
I'm sorry

127
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
I'm sorry

128
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
I'm sorry

129
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
For taking your company

130
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
I'm really not used to you

131
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Take a good life

132
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Thank you for helping me

133
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
I'm saying good-bye to you

134
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
After I sell

135
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
You go to the back these days

136
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Someone will pick you up

137
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Take you away

138
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Really

139
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Really

140
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
When you're home

141
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
forget everything here

142
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
My world is like riddle

143
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Tar 꼭要準備

144
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
But snow won't be brave

145
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
You let me go

146
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
I'm determined to be alone

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Will you be brave?

148
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Are you worried about me?

149
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
I want to cover up those sorrows

150
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,720
How long have you been waiting for the start?

151
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Are you worried about me?

152
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
The memories are coming back

153
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
No, you're thinking too much

154
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
But time is growing

155
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
No

156
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Really?

157
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Not at all?

158
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Not at all

159
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Really?

160
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Really

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
I'm telling you not to worry

162
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
And don't have any feelings for me

163
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Because your life has nothing to do with me

164
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Brother Kai, we're going out

165
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Don't worry, I won't

166
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I won't

167
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Don't have feelings for anyone

168
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Otherwise, you and the people around you will be in danger

169
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Hunian

170
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Kai has given you to me

171
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
What did you say?

172
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
It's in my hands

173
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
I'm telling you

174
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
We should be honest

175
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Let me go

176
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Let me go

177
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
There are two endings

178
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
No matter if you understand

179
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Let me disappear in the darkness

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Can't see who's chasing behind

181
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Heartache and heartbeats

182
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,720
A blizzard in front of the eyes

183
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,120
Ending is a kind of

184
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,720
No matter if it's useful

185
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Let me disappear in the darkness

186
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Ending is a kind of

187
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
No matter if it's useful

188
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Let me disappear in the darkness

189
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Ending is a kind of

190
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
No matter if it's useful

191
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Let me disappear in the darkness

192
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Ending is a kind of

193
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
No matter if it's useful

194
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,720
