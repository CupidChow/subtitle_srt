00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Miss, you are mistaken

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
An Nian, what's wrong with you?

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
An Nian, are you ok?

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
An Nian

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Dr.Zhou, I have a question for you

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I didn't see it wrong, it's him

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Song Qian

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Is he really him?

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hello, I want to see Mr. Song

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do you have an appointment?

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then I will ask you first, please wait

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Miss

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have been here for the fifth time

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I want to ask Mr. Song

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When can I see him?

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Sorry, Mr. Song has left the office

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What?

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mr. Song, you have to accompany me tonight

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No, you have to accompany me

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It depends on your performance

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Boss

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Miss Gu comes to see you every day

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You really don't want to see her?

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There are many people who want to see me every day

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Send me away

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If I am the representative of Renxin Hospital

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you want to see Mr. Song?

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Miss Gu

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I didn't expect that

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can come here

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I just want to ask you for some advice

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mr. Song doesn't have to avoid me

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't know you

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why should I see you?

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You know the dean, right?

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The last call before he died was for you

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You doubt me

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just want to know what the dean told you

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Our Wei Group has been cooperating with the hospital

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Normal contact

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Is there any problem?

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Has Mr. Song been to Taicheng?

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Half a year ago, I was in Taicheng

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Met a group of drug dealers

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
One of them looks exactly like you

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But he was killed to save me

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I just want to know

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you and him

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Will be the same person

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Right?

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Miss Gu

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You mean I'm a drug dealer

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Do you know what you are talking about?

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I didn't mean that

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Then what do you mean?

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There are many people who want to get close to me

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You are the first one to get close to me in this way

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I just want to know

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is he still alive?

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Ok

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Then I ask you a question

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's your relationship with that person?

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
A friend who is not familiar

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A friend who is not familiar

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is it worth your concern?

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Miss Gu

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you want to hear what you are talking about?

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I will tell you again

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't care what your relationship with that person is

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
First, I'm not K

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Second, I haven't been to Taicheng

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Third, I haven't saved anyone

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Is it clear enough?

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If there is nothing else, I will go

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't believe there are people who are the same in this world

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mr. Song

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Miss Gu, I warn you

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If you follow me again, I will ask someone to take you out

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Mr. Song

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I know I offended you just now

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I want to apologize to you

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I apologize for this cup of wine

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I will never bother you again

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Miss Gu

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sorry

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Are you okay?

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I was careless

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is it fun?

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Miss Gu

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I didn't expect that

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Your hand to save the patient

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Is so sharp

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
When you are picking up the man's clothes

106
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It seems that you are more powerful than saving people

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What?

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't you like it?

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I like it

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The room is already locked

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We can go up directly

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But I am used to checking the other person's body first

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You don't mind, right?

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Of course not

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why is there no scar?

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I suddenly thought I was busy

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's do it next time

122
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't you think it's too late to leave now?

123
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't you think it's too late to leave now?

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's not impossible for you to play here

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Interesting

126
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Miss Gu

127
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm not used to the play of the love

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm not used to the play of the love

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Next time, I'll directly pay for your examination fee

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm used to the name tag

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You are really not her

132
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
At least she won't be so shameless

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You

134
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What are you doing?

135
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Recently, there are always women chasing money

136
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's you

137
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Who are you?

138
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
She

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is my fiancee

140
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
FiancÃ©e

141
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I have seen a lot of women like you

142
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I can't wait to see a rich man

143
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I can't wait to see a rich man

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't wait to see a rich man

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't have any education

146
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
My education won't let me hit people

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You should wake up Mr. Song

148
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Not me

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
In addition, I suggest you hang up my emergency doctor

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You have lost the memory of the morning fall

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
At least two weeks

152
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What do you mean?

153
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The name is now

154
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You dare to scold me

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
A fiancee who can't even see the ghost

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Should be scolded

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You, you stop

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Miss Gu, are you okay?

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Look at yourself

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Qian

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How are you?

162
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Are you okay?

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Are you okay?

164
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm cold

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go home now

166
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The sadness of the days and nights

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
How long will regret be released

168
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Calmly

169
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The loneliness of memories

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But the time will make me very flustered

171
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There is a little wind on the skin

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I miss those past

173
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I have already seen your yearning

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Tears are too strong

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Spreading this invisible wound

176
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The dream is in the white air

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I think about you when I walk through the window

178
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The way you came back

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't get through the emotions

180
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
One thought is hard

181
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Fill the tears

182
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I can't get through the emotions

183
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
One thought is hard

184
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Fill the tears

185
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I can't get through the emotions

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
One thought is hard

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Fill the tears

188
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
My world is a dark place

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Still learn not to be brave

190
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I decided to wander

191
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I think about those sorrows

192
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
How long will regret be released

193
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Calmly

194
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The loneliness of memories

195
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But the time will make me very flustered

196
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There is a little wind on the skin

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I miss those past

198
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I have already seen your yearning

199
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Spreading this invisible wound

200
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The dream is in the white air

201
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I think about you when I walk through the window

202
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The way you came back
