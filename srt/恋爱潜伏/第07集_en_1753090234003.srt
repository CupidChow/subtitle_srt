1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,400
You woke up don't worry they won't find anything

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,880
Your clothes are all wet so I changed them for you

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

6
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Let go

7
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,840
If you want to kill, kill quickly

8
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,080
If I want to kill you, I won't save you

9
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,480
If you really want to save me, let me go

10
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,240
You can't leave yet

11
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,600
You get out of the way

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,640
Where are you going

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,440
Peng Li is looking for you everywhere now

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,640
So what

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,960
I still want to go

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
I don't want to see you

17
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
You don't want to see me like this

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Yes, I don't want to see you again

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Don't you know who Peng Li is

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,920
Don't be so stubborn

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,960
Can you believe me once

22
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,360
Don't be so

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,360
I believed him, what happened

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,080
I was going to save you right away

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Peng Li will kill you immediately

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,720
I went to save you later

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
But it's too late

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Girl

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,520
You shot me and gave me a slap

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,520
You should be relieved

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Are you done

32
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Can I leave

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,440
If you are not convenient

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,560
Just give me your phone

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
I'll let my brother pick me up

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
What brother

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
What does this have to do with you

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
I don't have a phone

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Ok

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
I will go by myself

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,080
You can't get out of here without me

42
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
I'll do it myself

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Don't worry

44
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,080
After I send you away

45
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
We will not see each other again

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
We are at the police station

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
I want to ask you

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Didn't you say that my life and death have nothing to do with you

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Why are you still coming to save me

50
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,080
I saved you

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,080
You can't report me

52
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
I advise you to turn yourself in as soon as possible

53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
What else

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
You can't get out of here without me

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Take care

56
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
What are you doing

57
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
We are wanted

58
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Go

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Stop

60
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Don't move

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
I'll go and shoot

62
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Why did the police want to arrest us

63
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
The police in the rooftop is dead

64
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
The surveillance camera is on the scene

65
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Dead

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
You killed him

67
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
If I say I didn't kill him

68
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Do you believe

69
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
I don't know

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,080
I only know after coming out of the island

71
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,080
I am not chased or wanted every day

72
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
You can tell the police

73
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I was forced to do everything

74
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
When did you get hurt

75
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
I am not a doctor

76
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
This is a gun

77
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Aren't you going to go

78
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
You can go now, don't worry about me

79
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Don't worry, I will go

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
But not now

81
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
You should believe that I am a doctor

82
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
I won't let you die here

83
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
How long have you been in this body

84
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Less than two hours

85
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
You are really a crazy man

86
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Thank you for your compliment

87
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Don't blame me if you die

88
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
You don't have professional surgery tools

89
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Only some simple bandages

90
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
In the process of surgery

91
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
You may be in pain

92
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Even if you have the limit

93
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
It may be because of the wound

94
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
You want to save me

95
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Or scare me to death

96
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
This is a notice

97
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
If you believe

98
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
I believe you

99
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Don't worry

100
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
If I die

101
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
I won't die so easily

102
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Let's start

103
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
The bullet has been taken out

104
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
I will help you to seal the wound

105
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Wake up

106
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Kai

107
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Wake up

108
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Wake up

109
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
You said you won't die so easily

110
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Get up

111
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Wake up

112
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
You can't die here

113
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
I have something to ask you

114
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
I said

115
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
I won't die so easily

116
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
I won't die so easily

117
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Boss

118
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
I saw an address near here

119
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Find it

120
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
They must be there

121
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Boss

122
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Boss

123
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Boss

124
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Boss

125
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Finally

126
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,400
Oh×™×”

127
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:39,160
estimating

128
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,080
My world is a dark place

129
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm still brave

130
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
I'm still brave

131
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,080
I'm still brave

132
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm still brave

133
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,080
I want to face those sorrow

134
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,080
How long will you be able to release

135
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,080
The deep darkness

136
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Why do you still want to hide

137
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
What about you?

138
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
Why are you still here to save me

139
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,080
What is the secret that keeps me moving

140
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,080
From your mouth, I can't describe

141
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,080
What is the song that only lasts for a second

142
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Disappearing without a trace

143
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Hands shake to break free from the cage in the flower

144
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,080
A knife of pain breaks through the sky

145
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,080
The sky is empty, the wind is coming

146
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Who will be able to continue to be free and not afraid

147
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Let me disappear in the darkness

148
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,080
I can't see who is hiding behind

149
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,080
There are still pain in the wound, the memories are still in the crisis

150
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,080
There are two endings, no matter if you understand

151
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Let me disappear in the darkness

152
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,080
I can't see who is chasing behind

153
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,080
There are still heartbeats, a snowstorm in front of me

154
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,080
The ending is still in the middle, no matter if it is real

155
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Let me disappear in the darkness
