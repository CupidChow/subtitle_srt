1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
the

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:23,640
the

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,060
all we for all

4
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,980
we

5
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,460
forinas

6
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,320
president

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:52,400
to

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
How is it?

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Nothing here.

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Boss, can we really stay here?

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
They found this place so quickly.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
If it wasn't for the woman he saved at the hospital,

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
I really wouldn't have been able to find her.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Boss, we can't find anyone in this room.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
We can't see anyone outside either.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Impossible.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Unless they're still hiding in this room.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Find the third person who's here.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Search carefully.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Yes.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
But this chip...

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Don't come out no matter what happens.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Don't worry.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
I'll keep an eye on her.

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Give me the chip.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Or I'll kill you.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
If you kill me,

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
you won't be able to get the chip back.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
If you don't hand it over,

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
you'll die.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Stop!

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
You're not going to kill me?

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
I'm not going to kill you.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm going to kill you.

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm going to kill you.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm going to kill you.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I'm going to kill you.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I'm going to kill you.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm going to kill you.

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
It's you.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Don't you want this?

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Let us go.

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
I'll give it to you.

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Miss.

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Give me the chip.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Hurry.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Hurry.

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Get out of here.

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Where is she?

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Are you okay?

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Your hand is broken.

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I'm fine.

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Where's the chip?

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Is she that important?

55
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
You don't even want to die?

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
It's important.

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
I don't want to die.

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I don't want to die.

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
It's important.

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
She's more important than my life.

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
We can't run away.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
You can get out of here.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Let's go.

64
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
I'll go find someone to save you.

65
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Get out.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
You're the mole.

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm going to cut your hands off.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
You've exposed yourself.

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
We have to let you go.

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Don't think about it.

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
You're threatening me.

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Go to hell.

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
You're awake.

74
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
It's still burning.

75
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Didn't I tell you to leave?

76
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Why are you still here?

77
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
What are you doing?

78
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Don't you think it's too late to leave now?

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm a drug addict.

80
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Why did you save me?

81
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Answer me.

82
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Because I'm a doctor.

83
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
You're lying.

84
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
I'm not.

85
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Really?

86
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Why?

87
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Why?

88
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Why are you always taking me away?

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,400
I told you not to have any feelings for me.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Enough.

91
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I don't need you to remind me.

92
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Even if I have feelings for you,

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
we can't be together.

94
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Are you satisfied?

95
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Very good.

96
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Very good.

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Remember what you said today.

98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Boss, there's a fire.

99
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Stop.

100
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Hurry.

101
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Hurry.

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Run.

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I'll see where you run to.

104
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Go.

105
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Yes.

106
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Stop.

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Stop.

108
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Tell me.

109
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Where is the gold?

110
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
I don't know.

111
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
What did I say?

112
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
You...

113
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Ken.

114
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,400
You're the first person who can make me run away.

115
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
I finally remember where I saw you.

116
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
You're the daughter of the dean I killed, right?

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Why did you kill him?

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
You want to know?

119
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Then ask her.

120
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Find the chip.

121
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Or I'll push her into the sea.

122
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Wait.

123
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
What does it have to do with me?

124
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
You're really heartless.

125
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I thought she would be different to you.

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay.

127
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Then I'll push her down.

128
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
I'll count to three.

129
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
One.

130
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Two.

131
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Three.

132
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Four.

133
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Five.

134
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Stop.

135
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Go.

136
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Go.

137
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Two hands shake to break free from the cage in the flower

138
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,400
A knife cuts through pain and breaks through the sky

139
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,400
The endless night is empty and the next life is a horror

140
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Who dares to continue the time and space

141
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Let me disappear in the darkness

142
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I can't see who's behind me

143
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,400
There are still pains in the wound and fear in the memories

144
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,400
There are two endings, whether you understand

145
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Let me disappear in the darkness

146
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,400
I can't see who's behind me

147
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,400
There are still beating heart and blood in front of eyes

148
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,400
There are two endings, whether you understand

149
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Let me disappear in the darkness
