The Long Ballad

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Episode 18

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Song Qian, how could it be you?

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Song Qian, wake up!

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You can't die.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I have a lot of questions to ask you.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You... you should wake up.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Song Qian! Song Qian!

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Song Qian!

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why did you save me?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Aren't you with them?

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Say something!

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm asking you why you saved me!

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Song! Run!

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Song!

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Song!

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Song!

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Song!

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Song!

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Thank god it's just a bullet wound.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Take some medicine and wipe it.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It'll be fine after a bandage.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I escaped again.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't worry.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm here.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You won't die.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You still owe me a lot of explanations.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You said we should catch fish for dinner?

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We can't eat anything if we don't catch fish.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Maybe we'll spend the night here tonight.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why don't you catch fish?

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm injured. I can't catch fish.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Fine.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll eat it myself.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You can catch it yourself.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Can we catch fish?

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Can we catch fish?

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why are you laughing?

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Move!

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Move!

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't laugh!

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm not catching fish.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I told you to laugh!

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They're over there!

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Go!

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go!

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Meng!

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's go!

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Go!

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't worry.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I won't let you die.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is he that important?

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You don't even want noodles?

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's important.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's more important than my life.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He doesn't do much like a drug dealer.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He's more like...

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Officer Zhuang Han.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Song Qian.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Where are you?

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you okay?

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Officer Zhuang Han.

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He's at home.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're Gong Qian?

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Officer Zhuang Han.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Are you okay?

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm fine.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Is he...

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You guessed it.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Three years ago,

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I sent him into the drug company Wei's.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I let him meet Wei Qing and find the Poison Master.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Later on,

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Wei's sent Song Qian to Tai City to deal with Peng's brothers.

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He has already been collecting the drug dealers in Tai City.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Although they got their criminal records,

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
they were heavily injured.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But fortunately,

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the mission let him get Wei's approval

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and enter the core circle.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,920
in the core circle.

84
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,800
What surprised me was

85
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
that she met you

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
on that mission.

87
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,480
Although I don't know

88
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,640
what you are,

89
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,960
she was willing to risk her life

90
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,840
to save you.

91
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,760
That means she cares about you.

92
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,680
I want to know

93
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,240
why she was there

94
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,480
when the dean was killed.

95
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Actually,

96
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,360
the dean and your mother

97
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,040
both knew about the extra-parameter

98
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,800
and got the elevator card.

99
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,080
Song Qian secretly found out

100
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,520
that the guards would send Zhao Yan

101
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,480
to deal with the dean.

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
So the police decided

103
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
to send Song Qian to drink wine.

104
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,320
But it didn't occur to me

105
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,000
that the dean was having a heart attack

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
when he was fighting with Zhao Yan.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,520
Dean.

108
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,040
In the end,

109
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,480
Dean.

110
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,840
Song Qian still took a step back.

111
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,280
Dean, I'm going to sleep.

112
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,120
Maybe it's fate.

113
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,320
I didn't expect to see you again.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,800
What about Zhao Yan?

115
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,600
Zhao Yan was afraid

116
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:56,520
that the

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,400
After repelling the plan by complying with the logical interests

118
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,520
and êµ¬ Initially caught him

119
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,160
You said you areGoldy's son.

120
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,760
You didn't know

121
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,400
that you were attracted to me only because of engineers.

122
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,920
True.

123
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,000
She's not for you.

124
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,760
I'll send someone to take care of her.

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,160
I hope you two won't meet again.

126
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,200
Her mission is unpredictable.

127
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,240
Miss Gu, she's not for you.

128
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,000
I hope you two won't meet again.

129
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,760
Gu Nian.

130
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,560
Why are you here?

131
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,600
Why is it so hot?

132
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,200
You have a fever.

133
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm fine. You can go.

134
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm fine.

135
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,280
Why are you still here?

136
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,280
I'm not going.

137
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,760
I don't want to be like that time in Taicheng.

138
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,600
We'll end it without saying anything.

139
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,720
Can we not care about the future

140
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,040
and tomorrow?

141
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,480
Let's just care about now.

142
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,840
Okay?

143
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,120
Do you really want me to leave?

144
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,480
I'm leaving.

145
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,520
You'll regret it.

146
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,080
Gu Nian.

147
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,520
There will be danger around me.

148
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,240
I'm afraid I'll lose you.

149
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm not afraid.

150
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,160
Because you're here.

151
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,440
Don't push me away anymore.

152
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,440
I'm not afraid.

153
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm not afraid.

154
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm not afraid.

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,440
Okay?

156
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I'm not afraid.

157
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm not afraid.

158
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm not afraid.

159
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I'm not afraid.

160
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm not afraid.

161
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
I'm not afraid.

162
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm not afraid.

163
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
I'm not afraid.

164
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm not afraid.

165
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
I'm not afraid.

166
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm not afraid.

167
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm not afraid.

168
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I'm not afraid.

169
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm not afraid.

170
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I'm not afraid.

171
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm not afraid.

172
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm not afraid.

173
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm not afraid.

174
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm not afraid.

175
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm not afraid.

176
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm not afraid.

177
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm not afraid.

178
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm not afraid.

179
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm not afraid.

180
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm not afraid.

181
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I'm not afraid.

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm not afraid.

183
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm not afraid.

184
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm not afraid.

185
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I'm not afraid.

186
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
I'm not afraid.

187
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm not afraid.

188
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm not afraid.

189
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600

I'm not afraid.

191
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm not afraid.

192
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm not afraid.

193
