1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Winnie Winnie

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:19,960
Gong dad had my eyes are you still alive

5
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,680
Ha, ha, ha

6
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,380
Do you think I'm dumb?

7
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,880
Now I want you to look at her and die

8
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,760
Do you burst up running?

9
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,840
You make some�라는

10
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,980
Ouch. You don't stop

11
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Ah Tian!

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Brother Kun, are you okay?

13
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Brother Kun, are you okay?

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm going to kill you!

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Brother Kun, there's a police! Let's go!

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,960
Let's go!

17
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Girl, hold on!

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
Ah Tian!

19
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Doctor!

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Doctor!

21
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Doctor!

22
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Love becomes regret

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,960
The rain is still falling

24
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,960
I want to be with you

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm really not used to

26
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Girl, hold on!

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Girl!

28
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Girl, don't sleep!

29
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
It's hard to live this life

30
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,960
I fill my eyes with tears

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,960
I leave the world in a dark place

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,960
I still learn not to be brave

33
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,960
I decide to wander

34
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,960
I laugh at the sadness

35
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,960
You regret it, I can only let go

36
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,960
A calm resistance

37
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,960
A lonely feeling of memory

38
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,960
But time can make me more anxious

39
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,960
There is a little bit of wind on my skin

40
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,960
I cry and miss the past

41
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm sorry

42
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Who?

43
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
No!

44
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Don't have feelings with anyone

45
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Otherwise, you and the people around you will be in danger

46
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Ah Nian, you're awake

47
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Wait, I'll call the doctor

48
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Great!

49
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
This time, we finally caught the Kun Tuan Huo successfully

50
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,960
I believe you will be back in the police soon

51
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Oh, right, what's your relationship with Gu Nian?

52
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Don't forget your mission

53
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
You are too involved

54
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,960
It's not good for you

55
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,960
I understand

56
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,960
You have to keep the trust Wei Qing has in you

57
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,960
The system will definitely appear at your wedding

58
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
I can't wait any longer

59
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
I have to take the initiative

60
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Why are you so anxious?

61
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Is it for Gu Nian?

62
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
No

63
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Anyway, be careful of the wound

64
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Let's go see Dr. Gu later

65
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,960
After all, he was injured because of you

66
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Okay

67
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Next

68
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Dr. Gu, we haven't seen you since you got hurt

69
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
So we want to see you now

70
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
And also see the doctor

71
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Who are you two seeing?

72
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
It's me

73
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm about to marry Ah Qian

74
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,960
So I want to find you to take care of it

75
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,960
So we can have a cute baby

76
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
I'm a passenger, not a passenger

77
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
I know you

78
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Right, Ah Qian?

79
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Sorry, we don't know each other

80
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Since Dr. Gu doesn't want to see me

81
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Then let's go, Ah Qian

82
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Wait

83
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Don't forget what you promised me

84
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
If you still don't make up your mind

85
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
I'll hand over the recording

86
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
What recording?

87
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
I suggest you ask Mr. Song

88
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Song Qian, you're a bastard

89
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,960
You have to keep your trust in Wei Qing

90
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
If you still don't make up your mind

91
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
I'll hand over the recording

92
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
The kiss is here

93
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
The kiss is here

94
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Are you sure Zhao Yan is here?

95
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
I made an appointment with Zhao Yan tonight

96
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
I promised him

97
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
As long as he shows up tonight

98
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
I can keep him safe

99
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
When will Zhao Yan show up?

100
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Wait a minute

101
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
I don't have time to waste my time with you

102
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Are you so impatient about me?

103
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Go after him

104
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Zhao Yan is there

105
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Hurry

106
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
What happened?

107
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Zhao Yan

108
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Zhao Yan, you can't die

109
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Zhao Yan, wake up

110
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
You can't die

111
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
You can't die

112
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
You haven't told me

113
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
You haven't told me the truth about my mother's death

114
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Song Qian, go call 120

115
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Miss, he's dead

116
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Impossible, he can't die

117
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
I can save him

118
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Calm down

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Let me go

120
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Calm down, he's dead

121
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Why is it like this?

122
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
I almost knew the truth

123
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
You're tired

124
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
I'll take you home

125
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
No need

126
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Miss

127
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Be careful

128
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
An Nian, are you okay?

129
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
I'm tired

130
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Take me home

131
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
An Nian

132
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
An Nian, let me take you inside

133
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
No need

134
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
By the way

135
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
How did you know I was there tonight?

136
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Weiwei told me

137
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
You went to the bar to find someone

138
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
I don't want to have the same thing again

139
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
So I went to find you

140
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
What did you find this time?

141
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Nothing

142
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
An Nian

143
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
I think you're stressed out

144
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
How about going to the medical seminar with me tomorrow?

145
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Let's relax

146
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Okay?

147
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Okay

148
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Why did Zhao Yan give me a card?

149
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
What's that sound?

150
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
What's that sound?

151
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
What's that sound?

152
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I don't care who you are

153
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Leave my house

154
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Miss

155
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
How are you?

156
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Are you okay?

157
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Did you get hurt?

158
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Should I call you K?

159
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Or Song Qian?

160
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Song Qian

161
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Song Qian

162
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Song Qian

163
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Song Qian

164
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Song Qian

165
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Song Qian

166
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Song Qian

167
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Song Qian

168
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Song Qian

169
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Song Qian

170
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Song Qian

171
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Song Qian

172
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Song Qian

173
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Song Qian

174
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Song Qian

175
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Let me disappear in the darkness

176
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,960
I can't see who's behind me

177
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
The wound still hurts

178
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Memories are still in fear

179
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
There are two endings

180
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
No matter if you understand

181
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Let me disappear in the darkness

182
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,960
I can't see who's behind me

183
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
The heart still hurts

184
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
A blizzard in front of me

185
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
There are two endings

186
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
No matter if you understand

187
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Let me disappear in the darkness

188
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Let me disappear in the darkness
