1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
way too sticky

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Episode 18

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Boss, aren't we going out for a deal?

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why did you ask me to come here?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to talk to you before we leave.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry for what happened to the account book.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But I hope you can help me find the mole.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Come on.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll leave this to you after drinking this cup of wine.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll go.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
By the way,

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I've given the idea to Kun in your name.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You can only choose one of the two.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's just a woman.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll ask for a deal.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Gu Nian.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We should go to the toilet before we leave.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let me go.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Boss, I'll go to the toilet.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Check what's going on.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let me go.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let me go.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
My eyes.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My eyes.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Where's Gu Nian?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Gu Nian, I'm going to kill you.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who are you?

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That woman ran to the mountain.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Be careful.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She took Kun's gun.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Gu Nian.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't come over.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Or I'll shoot.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Put the gun down.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What?

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You want to lie to me again?

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Gu Nian, I'm not lying to you.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What happened today was an accident.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll explain to you.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Put the gun down first.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Come back.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Where?

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Back to the place where the prisoner was?

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you know?

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've believed you.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't come over.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Or I'll shoot.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hurry.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Arrest her.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Gu Nian, put the gun down.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't come over.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I won't go back.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Didn't you say jumping down is a life or death?

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I bet on that life.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I bet I can leave here alive.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Gu Nian, don't.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Gu Nian.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Miss.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're finally awake.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Where am I?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is the hospital.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hospital?

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Someone sent you to the hospital from the sea.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Right, I'll call the doctor.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Doctor, she's awake.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Mom.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to call the police.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Call the police?

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What happened?

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Miss Gu.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We've arrested all the criminals

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
according to your positioning.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Just in case,

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
we'll send the police to the hospital to protect you.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hold me tight.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Close your eyes.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't worry.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I won't hurt you.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Open it.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Fireworks.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Miss Gu.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's New Year's Eve tonight.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I wish you a new start tomorrow.

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why am I so uneasy?

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nurse.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Nurse.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hurry up.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't worry, boss.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I've got the security and surveillance.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Gu Nian is in the ward.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hold her.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Go after her.

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hurry.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That one.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That one. Hurry.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Boss.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We need some time to check the surveillance.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We can't find her now.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Useless.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Keep all the exits.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If I want to kill her,

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I must catch her.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Go.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Keep searching.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Keep searching.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Check here.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sir, someone's catching me.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come with me.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll take you out.

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hello.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Did you find that woman?

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think I've seen you somewhere.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't let her get away.

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You...

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Go.

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You...

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How dare you escape?

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let me go.

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The sky is clear, the moon is empty,

127
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the wind is coming to the beast.

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Who dares to

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
continue to be afraid and be fearless?

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let me disappear in the darkness.

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't see who's behind me.

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There's still pain in the wound,

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
but I can't remember it.

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There are two endings,

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
but you don't understand.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Shi Kai.

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He's really not dead.

138
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Useless.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Keep searching.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes.

141
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Go.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't see who's behind me.

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There's still a thud in the heart,

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and a blood redness in front of me.

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
There's still a thud in the heart,

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but I don't understand.

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're awake.

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't worry.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
They won't find us here.

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let go.

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let go.

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Only one second left.

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I can't see who's behind me.

154
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
My hands shake to break free from the cage in the flower.

155
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,280
I can't help but feel hurt and break through the

156
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,000
walls of the warehouse.

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The sky is clear, the moon is empty,

158
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the wind is coming to the beast.

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Who dares to

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
be free from the void?

161
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let me disappear in the darkness.

162
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can't see who's behind me.

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There's still a thud in the wound,

164
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and a blood redness in front of me.

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There are two endings,

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
but you don't understand.

167
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Let me disappear in the darkness.

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I can't see who's behind me.

169
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
There's still a thud in the heart,

170
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and a blood redness in front of me.

171
