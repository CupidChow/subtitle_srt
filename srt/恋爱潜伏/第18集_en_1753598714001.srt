Episode 16

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Are you okay?

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Are you hurt?

4
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,400
Should I call you K?

5
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Or Song Qian?

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
What are you talking about?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When I was in danger, I pressed it.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I knew there was danger and someone would come to save me.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Only K.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because you said

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
As long as you press it.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
As long as you press it.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will come to save you.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will come to save you.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why did you pretend not to know me?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I have my reasons.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Because of Wei family?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Say something.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Say something.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Listen to me.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't investigate this thing anymore.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know all the killers behind the scenes.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But you chose Chen Mo.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You would rather hurt me than to protect them, right?

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I thought you had some respect for me.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I thought too much.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We are never the same kind of people.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't worry.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I won't tell your identity.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Just take it as saving my life.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't owe you anything anymore.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Miss.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Song Qian.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't want to see you anymore.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Take it now.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Get out.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Song Qian.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I want to know how you will come back.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000

Hello, please come in.

99
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Two big rooms, thank you.

100
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence.

101
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,520
Are you also here to attend the medical blood test?

102
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
I'm sorry, miss.

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
There is only one big room now.

104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Ah Qian, thank god we booked a suite.

105
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Otherwise, we would have to fight with Dr. Gu.

106
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Senior, you don't mind living in the same room with me, right?

107
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Of course.

108
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
You are not a couple.

109
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
You are not suitable to live in the same room.

110
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Ah Qian, how do you know they are not a couple?

111
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
It's normal to live in the same room.

112
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Yes, Mr. Song.

113
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
You are too fast.

114
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
One big room, thank you.

115
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Thank you.

116
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,560
Is he really your father?

117
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Hello, sir.

118
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
And saw it in my pockets, sir.

119
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,500
They were just filming you two.

120
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,500
That's why...

121
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,640
Yes, that's the meaning.

122
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,620
Stay at home.

123
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,900
Please stay at home.

124
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,540
Why did you decide to send him away?

125
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,540
I have to sleep with the devil.

126
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,540
An Nian, I'm going to take a shower.

127
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,540
Okay.

128
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Hello, Weiwei.

129
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
Have you turned on Zhou Shen's computer?

130
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,540
I have.

131
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,540
But his office's computer is very clean.

132
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
There is no Zhao Yan's medical record.

133
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
Impossible.

134
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,540
These kitchen medicine are banned from the hospital.

135
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,540
Why, Senior Brother?

136
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Zhao Yan.

137
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Senior Brother knows Zhao Yan.

138
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,540
An Nian.

139
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,540
Why are you here?

140
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,540
I want to have lunch with you.

141
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
Okay.

142
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
What do you want to eat?

143
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
Anything.

144
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Let's go.

145
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
Weiwei, wait a minute.

146
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
He has a second computer.

147
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,540
An Nian, be careful.

148
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
An Nian.

149
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,540
An Nian, what are you doing?

150
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,540
Nothing.

151
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,540
Do you want to take a shower?

152
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
The seminar is about to start.

153
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,540
I have to clean up.

154
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,540
You can go first.

155
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,540
Then I'll wait for you.

156
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
An Nian.

157
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,540
My patience is limited.

158
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
Don't make me wait too long.

159
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,540
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,540
Mr. Song and Miss Wei are really a couple.

161
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,540
When is the wedding?

162
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Soon.

163
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,540
Don't drink too much.

164
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
It's okay.

165
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
Cheers.

166
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,540
Cheers.

167
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,540
Everyone.

168
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,540
I want to announce one thing.

169
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,540
First, my fiancee, Song Qian.

170
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
What do you want to say?

171
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,540
You'll know it soon.

172
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
Are you anxious?

173
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,540
I want to announce a good news to everyone.

174
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,540
Song Qian and I are going to get married next week.

175
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,540
How come I don't know?

176
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,540
I want to give you a surprise.

177
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,540
I wish you a happy wedding.

178
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
An Nian.

179
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Miss.

180
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,540
We've known each other for so long.

181
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,540
Don't you want to wish me a happy wedding?

182
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,540
I wish you a happy wedding next week.

183
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,540
Fake news.

184
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,540
Didn't you ask me to wish you a happy wedding?

185
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,540
I said fake news after I wished you a happy wedding.

186
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,540
You are really strange.

187
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,540
I used to be very happy with Song Qian.

188
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,540
But I didn't know that.

189
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,540
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,540
I used to be very happy with Song Qian.

191
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,540
Since you appeared, everything has changed.

192
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
You'd better watch Song Qian closely.

193
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
In case she falls in love with me.

194
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
You...

195
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Don't play your big girl's temper in front of me.

196
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
I don't want to eat this.

197
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,540
Miss.

198
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,540
Where are you?

199
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
I'm waiting for you in the room.

200
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,540
What are you doing, Mr. Song?

201
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,540
Why don't you answer my phone?

202
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Why should I answer it?

203
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
Don't you want to ask me about my wedding?

204
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,540
No.

205
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
Mr. Song.

206
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
Is there anything else?

207
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,540
I'll go first if there's nothing else.

208
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,540
I'm leaving.

209
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,540
And Zhou Shen is waiting for me.

210
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,540
I'm going back to my room now.

211
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
Miss.

212
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,540
Zhou Shen doesn't suit you.

213
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,540
Who is suitable for me?

214
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,540
You?

215
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,540
Do you think my daughter will be with a gambler?

216
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
Mr. Song.

217
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
Please make it clear.

218
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
You have your fiancee.

219
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
I also have my own fiancee.

220
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
Fiancee?

221
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
What fiancee?

222
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,540
I've already agreed to his proposal.

223
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Do you know what you're doing?

224
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
Of course I know.

225
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,540
You and Wei Qing are getting married next week.

226
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,540
Zhou Shen and I are getting married soon.

227
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
There's nothing between us.

228
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
What do you mean nothing?

229
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
You said you liked me.

230
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
That's the past.

231
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,540
Whether it's K or Song Qian,

232
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,540
I won't love again.

233
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
Nian.

234
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Nian.

235
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,540
What is the secret that makes me feel like I'm in the dark?

236
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,540
It's too hard for me to describe from your mouth.

237
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,540
What is the song that disappears in a second?

238
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,540
It's invisible, invisible.

239
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,540
It's invisible, invisible.

240
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Hands shake to break free from the cage in the flower.

241
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
No need to say a word.

242
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,820
A knife cuts through the pain and breaks through the

243
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,540
sky.

244
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,540
The endless night is empty.

245
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
The next life is a nightmare.

246
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,540
Who is so reckless that it continues to be empty and

247
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,540
empty?

248
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Let me disappear in the dark.

249
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,540
I can't see who's behind me.

250
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,540
There are still pains in the wound.

251
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
Memories are still in the drama.

252
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,540
There are two endings.

253
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,540
No matter if you understand.

254
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Let me disappear in the dark.

255
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,540
I can't see who's behind me.

256
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,540
There are still heartbeats.

257
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,540
A blizzard in front of the eyes.

258
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,540
This life is useless no matter what.

259
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,540
Let me disappear in the dark.

260
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,540
I can't see who's behind me.

261
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,540
There are still pains in the wound.

262
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,540
Let me disappear in the dark.

263
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,540
There are still heartbeats.

264
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,540
Let me disappear in the dark.
