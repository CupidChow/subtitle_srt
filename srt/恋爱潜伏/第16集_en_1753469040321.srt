1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Ani you woke up

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,840
How do you feel uncomfortable where the fire people

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,520
Those people suddenly surrendered but he just wanted to give you a lesson

6
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
I didn't expect the warehouse to really burn up

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,520
Did he tell you who was behind it

8
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
It's okay to tell you

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Blame you for seducing other people's fiancÃ©

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Wei Ji

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Ani, don't look any further

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
If I hadn't arrived in time

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
Save you from the warehouse

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520
You're really gone

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,520
It's you who saved me

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Is it my illusion

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Ani, give me a chance

18
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,520
I want to protect you by your side

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
This is what your mother hoped

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,520
My world is a dark place

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,520
I will never be brave

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,520
I decided to wander

23
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,520
I want to cover up those sorrows

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,520
How long can regret be released

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Calmly resist

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Memories come together

27
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Ani, listen to me

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
I know you promised me

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Song Zimeng

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
I didn't bother you

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
I want to talk to him

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
You go out first

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
it is good

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
I know Wei Qing instructed them

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
I really recorded this time

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
You can listen

37
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Either I call the police

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Or take me to see Zhao Yan

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
You choose

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Gu Nian

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Can you not talk about this

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
I'm not talking about this

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm talking about this

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm talking about this

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm talking about this

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm talking about this

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm talking about this

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Gu Nian, can you not be so stubborn

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Then I will call the police

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
If you don't want trouble

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Take me to see Zhao Yan as soon as possible

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Since you are so stubborn

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Come to this place to find me at night

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Wait a minute

55
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
When the warehouse is on fire

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Are you there

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Not here

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Brother, why are you here

59
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Warehouse matter

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
I hope there will be no next time

61
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
You actually say that for that woman

62
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
If you dare to treat her like this

63
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
I will

64
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
So what

65
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Are you going to kill your sister for her

66
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Don't forget

67
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
His mother was killed by you

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Do you think one day he will know what will happen

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
I checked

70
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
I won

71
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Everyone here is very dangerous

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm not responsible for what happened

73
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
I didn't say you were responsible

74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Sir, this is a private place

75
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Please go back

76
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Baishi card

77
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Continue

78
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Please

79
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
What did you just give him

80
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
The boss here is Baishi Tong

81
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
This card can do anything

82
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Stop playing

83
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Stop playing

84
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
What happened later

85
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Let you go and you go quickly

86
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
What about you

87
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Take care of yourself

88
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Who is this

89
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Long time no see

90
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
You got the wrong person

91
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
I am not K

92
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
You are not K

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Then why do you have this card

94
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
I only gave this card to two people

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
You are not him

96
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Then who are you

97
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
I am from the Wei family

98
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Wei family

99
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
So you are the one

100
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
The new owner of the Wei family

101
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
You look like K

102
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
I thought he was back alive

103
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
This is

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
I am his fiancee

105
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Thank you

106
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,520
So you are the young lady of the Wei family

107
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
But why do I feel

108
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
The young lady in my impression

109
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Seems a little different

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Why are you so serious

111
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
I just want to say

112
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
The young lady of the Wei family

113
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Seems beautiful

114
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Let's talk about business

115
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
I'll find Zhao Yan

116
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
It's weird

117
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Recently

118
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Everyone is asking for Zhao Yan from me

119
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
You take a leave

120
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
So many people

121
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
This is not about money

122
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Or

123
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
You can exchange your most precious things with me

124
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
For example

125
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
The young lady of the Wei family

126
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Your casino in the southeast

127
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Has been controlled by me

128
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
If you don't want to keep it here

129
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
I advise you to do it

130
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I'm sorry

131
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Are you sure Zhao Yan is here

132
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
You two can see it

133
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Yes

134
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Kun

135
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Girl

136
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
I'm not dead

137
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
You are sad

138
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
I know you are looking for Zhao Yan

139
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I let go of the wind

140
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
And then I brought you out

141
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Isn't it a surprise

142
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Go

143
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Tie him

144
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Yes

145
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Kun, it's not too long

146
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
If you do anything to us

147
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
The police won't let you go

148
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I've been standing on the edge of the wind for so many years

149
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Do you think I'm afraid of the police

150
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
Even if I die

151
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
I will hold you together

152
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
I know

153
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Let him go

154
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
I will accept all your requests

155
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Let go

156
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
K

157
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
I want you to die with him

158
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm not K

159
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
You found the wrong person

160
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Pretend

161
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
You keep pretending

162
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
K

163
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Aqian, save me

164
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
Aqian

165
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Aqian, save me

166
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Aqian

167
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
You don't go out with the fire today

168
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,520
And you

169
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
We have done so much for your Wei family

170
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Just because we don't use value

171
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
You sent him here

172
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Want to get rid of us

173
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
K

174
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Do you still deny your identity

175
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
I don't know what you're talking about

176
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
Okay, then you keep acting

177
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Miss Wei

178
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
You don't know yet

179
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
You are a fiancee

180
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
And this woman

181
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
At that time in Taicheng

182
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
But it was very hot

183
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
He even

184
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Doesn't even want to die

185
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
He wants to jump off the sea to save him

186
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
K

187
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Because we were brothers

188
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
I give you a chance to save them

189
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
I have another gun

190
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
I want to see which one you choose

191
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
A fiancee

192
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
An old lover

193
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
You pick one and kill it

194
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I put another one

195
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,520
With you for a hundred years

196
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,520
How about it

197
