The Long Ballad

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Episode 18

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Stop!

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let go!

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Tell me.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How did you know I wasn't in the bathroom?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You admit it?

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You tested me.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How did you know?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Tell me.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We came back to the bathroom to take the rain.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But there are many prints in the bathroom.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you must have been out.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You're the one they're looking for.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why don't we make a deal?

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You let me go.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I promise I won't tell anyone about it.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You think you can threaten me

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
after you know this?

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can kill you now.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Kill me then.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're really not afraid of me?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you want to die?

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm afraid.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm afraid to die.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm trying to find a way out.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If they can't find anyone tonight,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
they'll suspect the people in there.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you kill me now,

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
no one will help you prove it.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I bet you'll end up like me.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Either you help me go,

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
or we die together.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I underestimated you.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I hate people threatening me.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What are you doing?

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's this?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
As long as I press it,

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the thing on your foot will explode immediately.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't think about taking it down.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Only I have the password.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Crazy.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is all crazy.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you say a word,

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you'll die.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why are you doing this to me?

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I just want to go home.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're useless.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You told me

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the account book was stolen.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If we can't find it,

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
we'll all die.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Brother Feng, I swear

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
my security is very strict.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can't even fly a fly.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then tell me,

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
how did you get in?

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Could it be

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that we have a mole?

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Open the door.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Tonight, you're really a suspicious person.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What are you doing?

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can't be friends with him now.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I want to take a bath.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is all crazy.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If you say a word,

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you'll die.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It'll be a trouble to keep it sooner or later.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Although he doesn't kill me now,

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
he won't do anything to me after Nanbao.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why is it so long?

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can you change my clothes?

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are you doing?

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't do anything stupid.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll find someone to get you some clothes.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Brother Tian.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Kun asked for you.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I got it.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm warning you.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't move in the room.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you okay?

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm fine.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Did you get hurt?

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where is he?

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I didn't see him.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He was out there.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But if you touch her,

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
you'll find out something.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Boss will be unhappy.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But this woman

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
can let me know

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
a lot of things.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Brother Kun is smart.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't you think

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
K will come back to save you?

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm his person now.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're not afraid.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He will settle it with you.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
K.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Will he offend me for a toy?

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Say it.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Did K leave my room last night?

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't say it.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If I lose, I'll die immediately.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I knew you wouldn't

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
let go so easily.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I prepared

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
something good for you.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Find her.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is what you want.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Wait.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What?

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We...

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We didn't leave the room.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're kidding.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But I can help you.

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What?

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can help you to keep an eye on her.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You?

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I was caught by her.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
She won't let me go.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Gu Nian.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why do you think I believe you?

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Because I want to live.

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Want to live?

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
As long as you say K left the room last night,

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll let you go.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But if you don't say it,

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I won't be polite.

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll give you three seconds.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
One.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Two.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He...

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He...

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
K.

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You're good.

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're so bad at this.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm here to tell you

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
how you want to treat her.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But if you want to use her

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
to deal with me,

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I won't let you go.

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't mean that.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Now everyone has to pay.

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Do you think a woman

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
can steal something from you?

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I didn't tell you.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Someone stole something last night.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Do you think you can hide it from me?

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
When I interrogate her,

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll know who the culprit is.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
K.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You want to fight back?

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You want to die?

174
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
K.

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Are you okay?

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
How are you?

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Can you still hide?

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I found her.

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What's the matter, K.

180
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll give you three seconds.

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You don't want it?

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Give it to me.

183
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let me disappear in the darkness

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can't see who's behind the scenes

185
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The wound still hurts

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm still afraid

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
There are two endings

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No matter if you understand

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let me disappear in the darkness

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let me disappear in the darkness

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't see who's behind the scenes

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The wound still hurts

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm still afraid

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There are two endings

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No matter if you understand

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let me disappear in the darkness

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't see who's behind the scenes

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The heart is still beating

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
A blizzard in front of me

200
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The ending is still there

201
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No matter if it's useful

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let me disappear in the darkness

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't see who's behind the scenes

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The heart is still beating

205
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A blizzard in front of me

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The ending is still there

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No matter if it's useful

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Let me disappear in the darkness

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
