1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
P seen

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,200
I'm taking him away now.

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,520
If you have any problem, just tell me.

5
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,880
I've given you my face.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,760
You don't want it.

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,920
Go.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,040
Hold me tight.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,920
Close your eyes.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What are you waiting for?

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Kill them all.

12
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,200
OK.

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
You'll regret it.

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
You'll regret it.

15
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,800
You're awake.

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,680
Don't worry.

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,960
I asked aunt to change your clothes.

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,400
I didn't tell them anything.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,920
Can you help me solve this?

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,800
I don't want to be a prisoner.

21
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,400
You...

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
What do you mean?

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
You're not a prisoner.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
You're a prisoner.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
You're a prisoner.

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
You're a prisoner.

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
You're a prisoner.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
You're a prisoner.

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
This is a locator.

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
You lied to me.

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,320
The problem with Kun hasn't been solved yet.

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
There will be danger later.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
As long as you're willing,

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
I'll come to save you.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Locator.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,520
How can I run?

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Don't think about running.

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
If you don't run,

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
I can help you.

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
If you run,

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,480
you'll die a long time.

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,760
Understand?

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
What if I want to

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
bet on the life of that man who died of alcohol?

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
No one can run out of this island.

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Including me.

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,040
It seems that I can only leave

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
with him.

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I can't use this medicine.

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,800
You're so nice to me all of a sudden.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What are you planning?

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Save me.

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
The medicine is a reward for you.

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,120
As the medicine is poison,

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,360
it's stillPal upstairs.

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,360
OK, I accept it.

57
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,560
Jun Chen

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
OK, I accept it.

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Do me the favor,

60
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
please.

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
You'll die covertly if you hurt Dieci.

62
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Stop.

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
I haven't finished.

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
I don't want anyone to touch me.

65
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,960
Why can't I see that man?

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
We're on the same boat now.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,360
You have to trust me at least.

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,560
I won't run away again.

69
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,640
I won't tell anyone about you.

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,240
But I hope you can protect me.

71
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,680
Aren't you afraid that I'll help you sell it?

72
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,880
I believe you're different from them.

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm determined to wander.

74
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,320
What's the difference?

75
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,640
I want to cover up those sorrows.

76
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,440
How long will regret last?

77
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,400
You're so fat.

78
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,520
Are you familiar with it?

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,960
The loneliness of memories.

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,560
No.

81
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,680
But time is growing.

82
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,640
I'm not afraid now.

83
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,280
It will make me and the stars.

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,880
Why?

85
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,920
There's a little bit of wind on the skin.

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,240
At least you haven't hurt me.

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,880
I miss the past.

88
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm depressed to see your eyes.

89
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,600
Okay.

90
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,360
I'll give you a chance.

91
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,600
We debut tonight.

92
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,520
I'll help you get rid of A'Kun.

93
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,680
You're really willing to help me?

94
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,960
But if you fail to escape,

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,120
I'll get rid of you.

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,200
Can you help me?

97
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,000
Have you forgotten A'Kun?

98
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,080
Yes.

99
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,960
Brotherkr cash!

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,120
Boss will be back soon.

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,840
Will it really kill us?

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,520
Zheng Wen is definitely watching K事情.

103
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,320
Can he save her?

104
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,920
Which means he's being guilty.

105
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Hahaha, K.

106
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
What?

107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
You are so angry at me.

108
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
I was impulsive today.

109
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
It's my fault to be your brother.

110
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Dr. Gu, I apologize to you.

111
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
What?

112
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Why are you so mean?

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
We are brothers.

114
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
We should share good things.

115
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I bring you a gift today.

116
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
What?

117
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
The most beautiful woman in Taichung,

118
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Benita.

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Play with me tonight.

120
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Brother K, I want to learn Taichi too.

121
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
How?

122
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I want you to teach me.

123
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Okay.

124
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Don't forget we have something to do tonight.

125
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
What?

126
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Can you give way?

127
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Don't disturb us.

128
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Where?

129
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Take it.

130
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Me?

131
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Brother K, don't you want to teach me?

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Watch carefully.

133
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Put your hand here.

134
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Relax your right hand.

135
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Relax your shoulder.

136
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
And then breathe in.

137
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Exhale.

138
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
And release the root.

139
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Do you learn it?

140
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Play by yourself.

141
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
The gift you gave is too valuable.

142
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
You can keep it for yourself.

143
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Boss, why did you come back early?

144
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I have to go to the hospital.

145
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I have to go to the hospital.

146
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Why did you come back early?

147
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Boss.

148
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Is this the woman you like?

149
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
I gave you so many women but you don't want them.

150
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
So you like this kind of woman.

151
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
I think I've seen you somewhere.

152
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Sorry.

153
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
I need to go to the bathroom.

154
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,920
The man I've been looking for is a drug dealer.

155
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Why did he kill my mom?

156
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
So you two are fighting for this woman?

157
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Boss, no.

158
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
We are good.

159
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Brother Ke.

161
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Drink.

162
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Come on, brother.

163
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
You drank this cup of wine.

164
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
You forgot today.

165
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Come on.

166
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Come on.

167
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
I don't drink the wine that others gave me.

168
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Chung Chang.

169
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,220
dire

170
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Is the task that I left you done?

171
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Yes.

172
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
I don't want to make a mistake.

173
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
You'll see, I kill you.

174
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
I will be noticed here sooner or later.

175
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,720
Don't follow so slowly.

176
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,040
Doesn't she hear you entirely?

177
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,400
That's why I thought she's good- Gross too.

178
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,700
Why do I have to follow so slowly.

179
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,460
Gu Nian.

180
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,200
I think you don't need to leave.

181
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,260
My men will take care of you.

182
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,420
What did you say?

183
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,040
Brother K.

184
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,880
I'll be faster than that woman.

185
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,160
I'll treat you well.

186
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,060
And

187
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,980
I'm shocked by what happened.

188
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,040
I must beat them.

189
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,680
then how many maids should we be?

190
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,400
Where are you going?

191
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,640
Where are you going?

192
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,480
