Nian.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,800
I want to cover up those sorrows

5
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,800
How long will regret be released

6
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,400
Calmly bowing down

7
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Memories come to me alone

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,800
But time can be long

9
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,000
It will make me still panic

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,800
There is a little wind on the skin

11
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,800
I cry and miss those past

12
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
I want to cover up those memories

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Why don't you push it away?

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
I forgot

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
You have always been so stupid

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,900
Did you tell me that

17
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,800
anyone near neighboring city

18
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,000
will know you

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,320
you know me

20
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,440
don't you do

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,600
the things a little more

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,800
ever

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
I didn't.

24
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
I knew you

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,300
were not the only one

26
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
I'll be there in a minute.

27
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,900
Brother, did you see Song Qian?

28
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,460
I told you to warn her

29
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,660
to stay away from Gu Nian.

30
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,620
Gu Nian?

31
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,260
They're messing around again?

32
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,220
Wei Qing,

33
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,460
if you can't control your man,

34
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,820
don't blame me for handling him.

35
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,860
No, brother.

36
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,700
Song Qian helped you a lot.

37
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,740
Remember,

38
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,460
this is the last time.

39
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,940
I'll be there in a minute.

40
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
Where is he?

41
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,100
Where is he?

42
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:31,940
Go with me.

43
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,900
Why did you bring me to your room?

44
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,740
I'm going back to my room.

45
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,260
If you want to go back to your room,

46
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,260
you won't stay outside for so long.

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,820
You can fight with anyone.

48
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,460
But you can't be with Zhou Shen.

49
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,460
Did you know that Zhou Shen had a relationship with Wei's?

50
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,820
She had a relationship with my mother and dean's death?

51
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,940
So she's been lying to me.

52
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,820
But she's been looking for me.

53
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,220
What should we do?

54
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,900
Don't worry.

55
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,500
She won't have time to take care of you.

56
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,020
Why?

57
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,620
I won't let you live in the same room with her.

58
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,120
Lin Qiang, I even talked to her if I have to.

59
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,200
Theaced!

60
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,620
figures where

61
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,620
Mother,

62
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
You's gone.

63
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,080
I can't .

64
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,180
Just in five minutes.

65
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,660
Why don't you invite me to have a drink?

66
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,220
How about

67
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,900
we go to your room and have a chat?

68
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,300
Okay.

69
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,060
Let's go.

70
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,100
Gu Nian.

71
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,100
Give me some more time.

72
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,500
I'll take care of everything.

73
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,180
Boss.

74
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,940
Wei Shiyao hasn't sent the raw materials here.

75
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,140
We can't make it.

76
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,380
It's really you.

77
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,740
Poison Master.

78
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,900
Leave.

79
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,740
You don't look surprised.

80
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,580
When did you find out?

81
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,100
When did you find out?

82
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,820
You suddenly appeared

83
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,100
when Zhao Yan was in trouble.

84
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,180
You were searched

85
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,460
just by Gu Nian.

86
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,220
But what makes me sure is

87
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,260
the ring you gave me

88
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,060
was given to Gu Nian in Taicheng.

89
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,700
When he returned it to me,

90
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
there was no

91
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,820
Peng Li's chip

92
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,740
that I secretly put in

93
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,940
when we escaped.

94
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,420
Only the person beside him

95
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,420
can get the chip

96
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,460
and give it to him.

97
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,500
You were in a hurry

98
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,900
to see me.

99
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,060
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

100
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,180
If you kill me,

101
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,460
where else can you find

102
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,780
such a good shield?

103
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,780
What are you trying to do?

104
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,500
I want to poison him.

105
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,580
Okay.

106
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,900
But I'm far away from Gu Nian.

107
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,980
Why?

108
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,620
Can't you do it?

109
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,700
Of course.

110
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,420
It's a girl.

111
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,060
I found a hospital building map

112
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,700
on Zhou Shen's computer.

113
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,940
The strange thing is

114
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,820
this building map has a layer.

115
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,500
If the hospital really has a layer,

116
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,500
it can explain

117
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,260
why Zhao Yan

118
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,100
disappeared from the hospital.

119
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,340
Then this elevator card

120
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,740
should be the key.

121
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,620
Where is this place?

122
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,540
This is a poison factory.

123
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,780
So the dean and my mom

124
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,860
were killed because they knew

125
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,740
the layer was there.

126
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,420
So the dean and my mom

127
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,420
were killed because they knew

128
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,340
the layer was there.

129
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,820
Who are you?

130
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,420
Stop.

131
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,140
I'm new here.

132
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,420
New here?

133
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Turn around and show me.

134
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,860
Someone is coming in.

135
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,860
Run in the elevator direction.

136
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,260
Chase after them.

137
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,980
Yes.

138
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,460
Don't let them get away.

139
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,620
Ani.

140
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,340
Why are you here?

141
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,620
You said you were sick.

142
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,100
So I went to your house.

143
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,540
But there was no one there.

144
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,140
So I guessed you came to the hospital.

145
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,980
Are you sick?

146
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,540
Why are you sweating so much?

147
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,340
I'm much better.

148
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,980
If you're not feeling well,

149
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,940
I'll send you back.

150
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,940
No need.

151
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,700
I'll leave if I'm busy.

152
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,940
I have to leave here quickly.

153
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,620
Gu Nian's murderer疫 Hence he disappeared.

154
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,060
Ge Nie.

155
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,340
Pain peoples are still alive.

156
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,860
Oh.

157
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,300
Gu Nian.

158
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,860
Practish logic.

159
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,800
Don't differentiate me with all your��,

160
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,940
Gu Nian.

161
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,040
Gu Nian.

162
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,900
Are you hurting now?

163
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,500
already knew the hospital's floor.

164
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,300
So,

165
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,020
she can't stay.

166
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,420
Hello?

167
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,820
Did you find the girl's location?

168
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,020
I found her.

169
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,380
I'll send you the location.

170
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,500
When will you leave the police station?

171
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,620
I'm trying my best.

172
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,380
Don't be impulsive.

173
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,700
I can't wait for you to leave the police station.

174
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,100
She can't come in for her own sake.

175
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,100
What do you want?

176
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,660
Do you want to act alone?

177
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,700
Don't do anything rash.

178
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,460
I'll go with you.

179
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,380
Qian,

180
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,700
I've been looking for you for a long time.

181
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Why are you here?

182
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,500
Didn't we agree to go try on the wedding dress?

183
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,780
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,620
I've been too busy lately.

185
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,140
Where are you going?

186
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,660
Are you going to see Gu Nian?

187
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,260
No.

188
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,500
I have something to do.

189
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,780
I have to leave for a few days.

190
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,220
How about the wedding in a week?

191
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,620
Will you be able to make it?

192
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,180
Don't worry. I'll be there.

193
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,220
Come with me.

194
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,220
Who's that?

195
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,420
Let's go. I'll take you out.

196
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,860
What are you doing?

197
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,020
Where are you running to?

198
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,860
Stop!

199
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,740
Let's go.

200
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,820
Don't move.

201
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,420
Don't run.

202
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,860
Don't run.

203
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,980
The spring rain in my eyes.

204
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,460
From your mouth,

205
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,460
I can't describe.

206
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,060
What song is it?

207
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,380
Just for a second,

208
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,380
it disappears without a trace.

209
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,060
My hands shake to remove the cage in the flower.

210
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,460
Through thick and thin,

211
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:48,820
I broke through the

212
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,740
And let me

213
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,580
Can't see who's hiding behind

214
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,300
There are still pain in the wound, the memories are still in fear

215
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:11,860
There are two endings, no matter if you understand

216
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:17,460
Just let me disappear in the dark

217
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,980
Can't see who's chasing behind

218
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,940
There are still heartbeats, a snowy road in front of me

219
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,580
There are only one ending, no matter if it's useful

220
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,340
Just let me disappear in the dark
