00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 18

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,800
Dr. Gu,

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,240
you broke into the field.

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,760
I can call the police to arrest you.

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,720
Gu Nian, are you really crazy?

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,920
Dr. Gu,

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,880
what do you mean?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
This is where I was sent here.

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,640
I thought the case was complicated,

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,560
so I come to swear

11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,240
that I wasn't part of the punishment team.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Move it.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,160
Our ace is Mr. Cheng.

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,360
It's all search.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,640
His Fatty's...

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,360
Unibile!

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
You think he can just come into it?

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,120
Show me some mercy.

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,900
It's the first free money I've cosmetics and

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,420
once you earn each dollar

21
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,460
you should get married to me.

22
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,620
Thank you.

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,980
Dr. Gu,

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,620
you can get off the car.

25
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,480
I haven't updated it.

26
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,580
Your MackIN loan

27
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,340
Why?

28
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,380
Why should I help you?

29
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,940
But I advise you

30
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,300
not to be too cautious.

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,700
Otherwise, you'll be the best example tonight.

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,460
You set me up.

33
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,660
Dr. Gu.

34
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,700
I'll warn you one last time.

35
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,420
If you have evidence,

36
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,140
you can call the police.

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,780
You don't need to test me here.

38
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,820
You won't always be tough.

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,020
Then I'll wait for you to fight back.

40
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,180
Ani, don't worry.

41
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,260
I've checked it.

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,860
I won't let anything happen to you.

43
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,140
Thank you, Senior.

44
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,860
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,180
I hope

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,100
you can find someone who likes you.

47
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,060
Ani.

48
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,460
I know you have someone in your heart.

49
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,940
But I hope you won't reject me.

50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,540
You should also

51
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,740
forget about the past.

52
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,180
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,860
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,620
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,420
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,180
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,380
I'm a little tired today.

58
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,860
I'll go upstairs and rest.

59
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,340
I can't find any evidence tomorrow.

60
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,980
I have to leave the hospital.

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,260
I wonder how Weiwei is doing.

62
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,060
It's her.

63
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,220
Why is Kuni still here?

64
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,580
Miss Wei.

65
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,260
You want to expel me?

66
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,140
Why are you here?

67
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,620
Nurse Lin has told me

68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,100
that you bought her

69
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,060
and told her to frame me.

70
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,460
Nurse Lin also recorded

71
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,860
the recording of your deal.

72
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,460
Miss Wei, please listen to me.

73
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,300
I'm going to sue you for this.

74
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,860
Miss Wei.

75
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,460
You're not only blind,

76
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,780
but also have a brain problem.

77
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,300
In order to deal with me,

78
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,260
you lost your company.

79
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,860
Do you really think it's worth it?

80
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,700
If you're targeting me

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,700
because of Song Qian,

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,140
I can tell you

83
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,460
that I'm not interested in other people's fiancees.

84
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,620
If you don't like her,

85
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,060
why are you pestering her?

86
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
At first, I thought she was

87
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,140
someone I liked.

88
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,420
Later, I found out that she wasn't.

89
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,180
But I've let it go.

90
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,180
I'm going to accept a new relationship.

91
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,540
My cooperation with you is over.

92
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,020
I don't think we need to see each other again.

93
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
I hope Miss Wei

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,780
doesn't hurt her

95
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,140
because of the so-called love.

96
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
I'm going to help her.

97
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Otherwise,

98
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,940
I'll tell the whole story.

99
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,020
A'Jie, I didn't do anything.

100
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,020
Trust me.

101
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,580
Don't worry.

102
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,020
I trust you.

103
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,100
Wei,

104
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,140
have you found the person who sent us the video?

105
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,140
No.

106
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,900
That person sent it anonymously.

107
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,740
Anonymously?

108
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,940
Who's the one who sent it?

109
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,540
Could it be him?

110
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,100
Boss,

111
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,140
according to your order,

112
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,420
I've sent the video to Li Weiwei

113
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,700
from your travel record.

114
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,700
Gu Nian won't find anything.

115
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,820
But boss,

116
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,420
why should we help Gu Nian?

117
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,420
I have my own plan.

118
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,420
You don't need to know so much.

119
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,780
By the way, boss,

120
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,260
we've found Zhao Yan's whereabouts.

121
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,260
Okay.

122
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,500
Get the thing back.

123
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,140
Yes.

124
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,260
I helped them kill that old man.

125
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,460
They want to kill me.

126
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,740
Zhao Yan won't die so easily.

127
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,420
What's wrong with the patient?

128
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,500
It's just an external injury.

129
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,100
Excuse me, are you okay?

130
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,700
It's him.

131
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,460
How long will it take?

132
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,260
Sir,

133
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,220
here's the thing.

134
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,500
Your wound is seriously injured.

135
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,300
I need to call a nurse to treat it.

136
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,420
I'll treat your wound.

137
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,220
Please wait.

138
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,540
It seems that he didn't show up in the hospital by chance.

139
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,940
Officer Zhang Han,

140
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,540
I saw a suspect who might have killed my mom and dean.

141
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,300
How dare you call the police?

142
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,660
I'm going to kill you.

143
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,380
Are you okay?

144
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,220
Call a doctor.

145
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,540
Why are you coming back?

146
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,300
I don't want to die.

147
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,500
I don't want to die.

148
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,180
Come back.

149
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,940
You don't want to die.

150
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,580
Let me go.

151
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Hello, Zheng.

152
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,860
Keep all the entrances and exits of the hospital.

153
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,140
Catch Zhao Yan.

154
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,500
You really know Zhao Yan.

155
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,940
Is there anything strange about me knowing him?

156
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,980
Why did you get attacked by Zhao Yan?

157
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,260
What's your relationship with him?

158
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,580
Hello.

159
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,980
What?

160
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,900
Zhao Yan ran away?

161
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,260
Impossible.

162
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,220
I just saw him go down to the first floor.

163
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,620
Why did you help me?

164
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,900
You're in trouble.

165
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,300
Isn't it normal for me to help?

166
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,700
Are you worried about me?

167
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,020
Are you worried about me?

168
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,540
No.

169
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,460
Zhao 12 files.

170
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,900
Go to prepare blood for Chao,

171
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,100
and the doctor will check it for me.

172
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,260
Go.

173
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,780
Dr. Gu,

174
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,180
I have to go now.

175
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,820
Score?

176
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,300
Hello, I want to ask

177
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,500
Which room Mr. Song Qian booked?

178
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,300
We are his friends

179
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,700
So I want to say hello

180
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,940
Sorry, ladies

181
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,460
Mr. Song didn't book a room

182
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,620
Do you know Zhao Yan?

183
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,980
Sorry, I'm new here

184
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,420
I don't know who you mean

185
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,220
It's okay, I'll go to the reception and ask

186
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,500
Be careful

187
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm sorry

188
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,660
Where is he?

189
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,180
Qian

190
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,140
Zhao Yan is going to buy tickets and steal tonight

191
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,820
But I don't know what happened

192
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,780
He didn't show up

193
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,740
Boss, Miss Gu is looking for you

194
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,740
She also asked about Zhao Yan's whereabouts

195
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,460
Boss, do you need me to deal with it?

196
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,900
Deal with it

197
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,860
Yes

198
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,620
Wait a minute

199
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,660
Miss, this is the champagne you ordered

200
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,260
The wine tastes a little strange

201
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,980
Will it be itchy?

202
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,180
Miss, are you okay?

203
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,780
Let me help you to have a rest

204
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Don't touch me, go away

205
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,460
What's going on?

206
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,420
What's going on?

207
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,380
Are you crazy?

208
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,260
Are you crazy?

209
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,500
I'm sorry

210
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,460
I'm sorry

211
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,260
I'm sorry

212
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,300
I'm sorry

213
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,260
I'm sorry

214
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,380
I'm sorry

215
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,420
I'm sorry

216
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,460
I'm sorry

217
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,660
I'm sorry

218
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,700
I'm sorry

219
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,820
I'm sorry

220
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,860
I'm sorry

221
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,060
I'm sorry

222
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,100
I'm sorry

223
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,140
I'm sorry

224
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,340
I'm sorry

225
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,460
I'm sorry

226
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,740
I'm sorry

227
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,020
I'm sorry

228
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,300
I'm sorry

229
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,580
I'm sorry

230
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,860
I'm sorry

231
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,140
I'm sorry

232
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,420
I'm sorry

233
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,700
I'm sorry

234
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,980
I'm sorry

235
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,140
Let me disappear in the dark

236
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,740
I can't see who's behind me

237
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,980
There are still pains in the wound

238
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,380
Memories are not heavy

239
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,060
There are two kinds of ending

240
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,100
No matter if you understand

241
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,700
Let me disappear in the dark

242
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,380
I can't see who's behind me

243
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,620
There are still pains in the heart

244
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,100
A snowy road in front of me

245
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,580
There is only one kind of ending

246
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,740
No matter if it's useful

247
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,420
Let me disappear in the dark
