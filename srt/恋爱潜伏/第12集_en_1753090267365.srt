Episode 6

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Who is it?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You guys... Who are you guys?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hey!

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you don't talk, I'll call for help!

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Mr. Song, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Get out.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, yes, yes.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Song.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You guys continue, continue, continue.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Dr. Gu, why did you come to the country?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm lost.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Lost?

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Do you think I'll believe you?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Believe or not, it's up to you.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I told you to leave.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let me go.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't move.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't move.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's you.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The person who was in the dean's office that night, it's you.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He's the one who killed the dean.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let me go.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't move.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I won't hear wrong.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's this sound.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hello, I've arrived.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Where are you?

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What are you doing?

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I advise you to leave quickly.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My friend has called the police.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't talk nonsense with him.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's catch him first.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let me disappear in the darkness.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why don't you get off the car?

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How did you find me?

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Just passing by.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Passing by?

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Or you had a plan?

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What?

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You suspect me of being with them?

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Song Qian, who are you?

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you still suspecting me of that K?

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I said I'm not.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I know the person who was in the dean's office that night, it's you.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I advise you to go to the police station and explain everything.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't care what the reason is.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You think I killed the dean.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you have evidence, you can go directly to the police.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Song Qian, what are you doing?

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Dr. Gu, I don't know who you offended.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But I advise you to not ask for anything.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Otherwise, tonight is your best chance.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's not every time you meet danger,

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
you will be able to get out of it.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not afraid of danger.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not afraid of danger.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not afraid of danger.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm not afraid of danger.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm not afraid of danger.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm not afraid of danger.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not afraid of danger.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Someone will come to save you.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
With his identity, he can't do it himself.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Then why did he appear on the scene?

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But anyway, tonight I was attacked.

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It proves that someone doesn't want me to investigate anymore.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If the dean was really killed by Song Qian,

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm a witness.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why did he save me?

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Boss, in his phone,

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
except for a few photos of the drug drug,

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
there are no other suspicious ones.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Destroy the phone.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And you have to keep an eye on Gu Nian.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, boss.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But if he really starts to suspect you,

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
what should I do?

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Then get rid of him.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Dr. Gu,

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
look what you did.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
From yesterday,

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the drugs that were not yet listed

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
from the Wei family

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
have been sold in the market.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Impossible.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm the one who is watching the drug products.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's impossible to leak it out.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The problem is not with me.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The nurse can help me testify.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Dr. Gu,

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I was there at the time.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I really don't know if the drugs are leaked.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm only responsible for tracking the car.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I can't take the responsibility.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You...

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Dr. Gu,

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
you stop working and take the punishment.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Director,

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
do you think I'm selling drugs?

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
From the beginning,

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you were in charge of this project.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now something happened.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You must be responsible for it.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I haven't done anything.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I won't admit it.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But I will find out the truth.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Director,

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
please give me three days.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If I can't find out,

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will resign automatically.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hello.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I want to confirm

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
when Mr. Song can see me.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Dr. Gu,

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
we have informed you.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But I'm sorry.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mr. Song said

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
it's not convenient to see you for the time being.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Ah-Qian.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's go to eat.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Don't worry, Miss Wei.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
She can't find any evidence.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Soon,

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
she will be punished and expelled from the hospital.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
She will even go to jail.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I tried to enter the drug factory

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and the hospital's surveillance system.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There is no trace of the surveillance video

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
of the hospital.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But the video of the drug factory...

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Look.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The truck is in a blind spot.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There is no way to prove your innocence.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It seems that the problem is in the stomach.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ah-Nian,

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
this is very serious.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You might go to jail.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is the same as

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the way to frame my mother.

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The same.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There is no witness.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There is no surveillance.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is the death of aunt

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
related to the drug factory?

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And the death of the dean.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It may also be related to the drug factory.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I know they were killed.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But I have no evidence.

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
One day,

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
we will find the truth.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Look.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Look at this.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This truck has no fire extinguisher.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Its traffic record

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
should record everything.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This license plate

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
looks familiar.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It should be of the highest level.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But this parking lot

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
needs a certificate to enter.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
How can I get a certificate?

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Niannian,

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
there is no way to prove innocence.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I just have to

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
sell my beauty.

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Brother.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Miss, what's wrong?

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Please help me.

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My ankle is twisted.

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Are you okay?

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
How could it be?

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There is a license plate.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's there.

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Hey, who are you?

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,600
Sorry, let me hide for a while.

179
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,320
Dr. Gu,

180
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,040
you broke into my private property.

181
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,480
I can call the police to arrest you.

182
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,280
Gu Nian,

183
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,800
you're crazy.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,320
Gu Nian.

185
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,000
Is it...

186
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,600
is it Ago?

187
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,480
What is this spring season behind Eunuch Gu?

188
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,320
Yes.

189
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
능

190
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,800
What song is it?

191
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Just for a second

192
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Disappearing without a trace

193
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Hands in the air

194
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Stuck in the gorgeous cage

195
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
No words are needed

196
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
A knife cuts through pain and breaks through the sky

197
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
The endless night is floating

198
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,800
The next is the murderer

199
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,800
How to continue to be empty and empty

200
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Let me disappear in the darkness

201
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,800
See who is hiding behind

202
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
There are still pains in the wound

203
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Memory is still in fear

204
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,800
There are two endings, no matter if you understand

205
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Let me disappear in the darkness

206
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,800
See who is hiding behind

207
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
There are still pains in the wound

208
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
A blood-red eye in front

209
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,800
The ending is still a kind of unimportant

210
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Let me disappear in the darkness

211
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Thanks for watching!
