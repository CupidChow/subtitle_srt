The Long Ballad

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Don't move!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Don't move!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Get up!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sit down!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hurry!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hurry!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Get up!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hurry!

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What are you looking at?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm cleaning up!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The police are here!

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How could it be exposed?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Didn't you say you were hiding it well?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to marry Song Qian soon.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You let me escape now.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Are you kidding me?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Song Qian is a police officer.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You stupid woman!

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Brother, what did you say?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What do you mean by Song Qian is a police officer?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Look at the surveillance of the hospital.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Look!

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He took the police to poison her.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Song Qian is a police officer!

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Song Qian!

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You lied to me!

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will make Bai Yan Long pay for it.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I also want to take back all our goods.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's go.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's go.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mr. Song.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Look who is here.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Take the goods to the East Street Pier.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Or I will kill her.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Song Qian, don't come here.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't come here.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Shut up!

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Song Qian.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come here alone.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I will kill her if you dare to take the police.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I really regret it.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I really regret it.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
At that time, in order to get rid of the idea of investigation,

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I gave you a backup.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I let you meet her.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But it doesn't matter.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When Song Qian comes, I will kill her.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Then we will go abroad.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Zhou Shen.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Can you be sober?

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I would rather die than go abroad with you.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What do you want me to do?

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You killed my mother.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And you still want me to be with you.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I didn't want to kill her.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She found out my secret.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I also found out your secret.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You killed me.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You want to kill my mother.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You kill me.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why do you all force me?

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't worry.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I won't let you die easily.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Girl.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You bitch.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You ruined my life.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I won't let you live easily.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You go to die.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Are you crazy?

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If Gu Nian dies,

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
who will I use to threaten Song Qian?

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My sister.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Then she took my man.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Can't I do anything?

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What time is it?

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You still think about that man.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Good sister.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Can you be sober?

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay?

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Be good.

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't bother me anymore.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you dislike me so much?

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Boss.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Song Qian is here.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I didn't expect you to move so fast.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Qian.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Song Qian.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You know you are a dead man.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But you still come.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't come.

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What will you do?

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You two shut up.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You want to ask your woman, right?

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hand over the goods.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Throw the gun away.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Together.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Central Provincial Office

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hand over the goods.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let them go.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I didn't discuss with you.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you think I'm discussing with you?

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If you don't give me first,

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I will burn it immediately.

108
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,860
There's still three of you!

109
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,860
One...

110
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,580
There's still three of you!

111
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,360
You're here at last!

112
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,620
Artemis!

113
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,200
Artemis!

114
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,180
POLITICAL CATION

115
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,580
I'll count to three and switch with you.

116
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,380
Three.

117
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
Two.

118
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,780
One.

119
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,180
Are you okay?

120
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,980
I'm fine.

121
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,380
Gu Nian, go to hell!

122
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,380
A-Qian.

123
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,780
Song Qian!

124
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,180
Song Qian!

125
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,180
Bring Gu Nian here!

126
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,580
Boss, there are many police outside!

127
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,780
Run!

128
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,980
A-Qian!

129
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,980
Don't move!

130
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Stop!

131
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
Stop, Zhou Shen!

132
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,980
I'm here to help you.

133
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
You're here to help me?

134
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
Stop, Zhou Shen!

135
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,380
You've been arrested!

136
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,380
Hands up!

137
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,380
Hands up!

138
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,180
Let go!

139
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,780
I won't let you go!

140
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
Song Qian.

141
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
Song Qian.

142
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,580
Why are you so stupid?

143
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,180
I'm fine.

144
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,780
I'll be back to the police.

145
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,780
Don't cry.

146
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
Don't cry.

147
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,380
Song Qian.

148
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,980
Song Qian.

149
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,980
Song Qian!

150
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,980
Song Qian.

151
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,380
It's been three days.

152
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,780
Why isn't he back yet?

153
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,580
Hello, Wei Wei.

154
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
Song Qian.

155
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,380
Song Qian.

156
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,780
Zhang Han has been sacrificed.

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,780
I believe he's been taken revenge.

158
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
We'll arrange a new identity for you.

159
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,780
The mission is confidential.

160
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,980
We'll start immediately.

161
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
Hello, Wei Wei.

162
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,780
Nian, go on a blind date with me tonight.

163
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,380
Don't wait for that rich man anymore.

164
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
Okay, I'll go change.

165
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,980
I have a lot of pain in my heart.

166
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,380
My memory is stillFF.

167
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,180
There are two endings.

168
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,380
No matter if you understand or not.

169
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,180
Song Qian!

170
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,380
Let me disappear in the darkness.

171
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,180
Who is chasing after me when I can't see?

172
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,580
My heart is fluttering.

173
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,980
My eyes are covered in blood.

174
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,780
There is only one ending.

175
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,580
No matter it's useful or not

176
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,580
Just let me disappear in the darkness

177
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,100
Can't see who's behind me

178
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,700
Turn the end of the world

179
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,620
Start from the unknown

180
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,900
Just let me disappear in the darkness

181
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,340
Can't see who's behind me

182
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,860
Life is far away

183
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,020
Run towards the wide sky from now on

184
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,940
I never give up on my original intention

185
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,700
Just let me disappear in the darkness

186
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,580
Can't see who's behind me

187
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,100
Wounds and pain are still in the memory

188
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,780
There are two endings, no matter you know or not

189
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:17,500
Just let me disappear in the darkness

190
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,020
Can't see who's behind me

191
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,700
Wounds and pain are still in the memory

192
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:34,420
There are two endings, no matter you know or not

193
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:40,020
Just let me disappear in the darkness

194
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,540
Can't see who's behind me

195
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,860
Heartbeats are still beating

196
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,300
A blizzard in front of me

197
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,980
There are two endings, no matter you know or not

198
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,660
Just let me disappear in the darkness

199
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:08,220
Can't see who's behind me

200
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,500
Heartbeats are still beating

201
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,940
A blizzard in front of me

202
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:19,620
There are two endings, no matter you know or not

203
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,300
Just let me disappear in the darkness

204
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,820
Can't see who's behind me

205
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,900
Wounds and pain are still in the memory

206
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:44,260
There are two endings, no matter you know or not

207
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:50,860
Just let me disappear in the darkness
