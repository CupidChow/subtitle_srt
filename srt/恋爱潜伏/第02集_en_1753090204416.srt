Episode 16

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What are you doing, K?

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You really want to let her go?

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Are you looking for death?

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
She is right.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is indeed useful to keep her.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We will sell her to the rebels after we play for two days.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We will get what we want.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You are really something, K.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But I seem to remember that you don't like women.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Why don't we let our brothers try first?

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
She is now in a position to fight.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let me go! Let me down! Let me go!

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Keep an eye on her.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Brother Kun, that woman can't escape.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I am not talking about that woman.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It is K.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She is a bit strange tonight.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let me go!

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Bastard, let me go!

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Instead of torturing me, why don't you kill me now?

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You want to die?

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What do you think this is?

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You want to die?

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me tell you.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you die, guess if I can find you a friend.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Qin Shou!

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You don't want to die?

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Qin Shou?

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you know what Qin Shou is?

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Qin Shou?

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Welcome to Tai City.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is it me who helped you take off your clothes or yourself?

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Whatever. I will just take it as a dog bite.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But my body is very hot.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So exciting!

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Keep barking.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And then you will be more annoying.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What is this?

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Aren't you just trying to fight me?

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Stop!

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't worry. I am not interested in you.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Until now, you have to keep barking.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So that everyone outside can hear your voice.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It is indeed useful to keep it.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
After we play for a few days, we will sell it to the rebels.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It will be a great deal.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Someone is guarding outside.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How do I leave?

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
As long as you get the account book of Pengli, your mission is completed.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What is this?

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Brother Kun, what happened?

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Open the door!

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Open the door!

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Open the door!

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Open the door!

57
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Open the door!

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Did you get out?

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No one got out. We have been guarding here.

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Open the door!

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Open the door!

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There is no one here.

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't see anyone here.

64
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No one here either.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Brother Kun, there is no one here.

66
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No one?

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Open the door!

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Open the door!

69
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Why are you still standing there?

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Search!

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes!

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Who let you in?

73
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Search!

74
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But I don't exist.

75
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There are outsiders.

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
All rooms must be searched.

77
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you think a small bathroom like this can hide others?

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Still not leaving?

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I advise you to go to another place to search.

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Otherwise, you will be very difficult to get rid of them.

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Go!

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If it weren't for me, you would have been dead.

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What are you doing?

84
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't you want to die?

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Give me your hand!

86
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What are you doing?

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Open the door!

88
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You like to have someone, don't you?

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I warn you one last time.

90
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If you break again, I won't save you.

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If you really want to die, you will die.

92
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you let me go, I won't cause you trouble.

93
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Why do you want me to let you go?

94
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You didn't care about me just now.

95
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You just wanted to save me.

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't want to die.

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You didn't care about me just now.

98
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you know what you are talking about?

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If they know that we were just acting,

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
what do you think they will think?

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You are threatening me?

102
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you let me go, no one can threaten you.

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Only the dead can't be saved.

104
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You are threatening me.

105
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What is the secret that keeps me moving?

106
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
From your mouth, I can't describe it.

107
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What is the song that only lasts for a second?

108
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Disappearing without a trace.

109
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The hands shake to break free from the cage in the flower.

110
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The eyes are helpless.

111
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
A stab of pain cuts through the sky.

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The sky is empty, the wind is strong.

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Who is so reckless that it's empty and empty?

114
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let me disappear in the darkness.

115
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can't see who is hiding behind me.

116
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The wound still hurts.

117
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Memories are still in the drama.

118
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There are two endings, no matter if you understand.

119
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let me disappear in the darkness.

120
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't see who is chasing behind me.

121
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The heart still beats.

122
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
A blizzard in front of the eyes.

123
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The ending is still in the drama, no matter if it's true or not.

124
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let me disappear in the darkness.

125
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:22,000
