00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll pay for you.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I...

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Aren't you going to pick out wedding dress today?

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You go first. I'll pack up and be back soon.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay. Then come early.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Still not coming out?

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's go.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll take you out.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Give me back my phone.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Delete the video.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Please help me find Zhao Yan. I'll delete the video.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm asking you if you want to delete it or not.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't think about it.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Then don't blame me for talking nonsense.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What do you want to do?

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello, An Nian.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Give me back my phone.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Give it back.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
An Nian.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Give it back.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why don't you talk?

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I saw the surveillance video of the bar.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It was Song Qian who took you away.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You didn't sleep with her, did you?

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You really like her.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're asking me?

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You really like her.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Li Wen Wen, shut up.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What's wrong? Why are you not happy?

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Didn't you say she was annoying?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But at least the skin is good.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You should still enjoy it.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Li Wen Wen, you...

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why are you angry?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Are you not satisfied with her?

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How are you not satisfied with me?

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why are you not satisfied with me?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Mr. Song, I advise you not to misunderstand.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Please find Zhao Yan for me as soon as possible.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We can work together.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Work together?

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You slept with me.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How can we work together?

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I...

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't sleep with you.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Did you forget what you did to me last night?

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I remember I didn't sleep with you.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't play tricks on me.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you don't want to play tricks on me now,

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
delete the video for me.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why are you looking for Zhao Yan?

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He owes me money.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you don't tell me why you're looking for Zhao Yan,

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can't help you.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you don't help me,

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll have other ways.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What the hell are you doing?

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Open the door.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, I got it.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
An Nian.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
An Nian.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Open the door, An Nian.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
An Nian.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's related to my mother's death.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is it okay?

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
An Nian, open the door.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Delete the video.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll help you find it.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
An Nian.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I didn't record the video.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Gu Nian, you're really something.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This trick is always good.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
When can you find him?

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I only promised to help you find him.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I didn't say I would find him.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You lied to me again.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Open the door, An Nian.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We're all the same.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What else do you want?

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Open the door.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Song Qian.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Open the door.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You like him?

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I thought you liked someone called K.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, I like him.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But it has nothing to do with you.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're not K.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Open the door, An Nian.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Song Qian,

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I asked you to figure out that you have a fiancee.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't do this kind of misunderstanding again, okay?

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Open the door.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
An Nian, are you okay?

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I looked for you all night with Weiwei yesterday.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Are you and her...

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have nothing to do with her.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm not brave enough to decide.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I warned you not to have any feelings for me.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Even if I have feelings for you,

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
we can't be together.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We've already forged the secret of the lost memory for you.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Your current identity is Song Qian.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Remember to cut the past.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Otherwise, it will be very dangerous.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Gu Nian, why are you bothering her again?

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Next.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Dr. Mu, the owner is looking for you.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's strange.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why would the owner ask me to come to the warehouse?

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Who are you?

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How did you get in?

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Gu Nian,

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you've offended someone you shouldn't have.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Someone spent money to buy your life.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You can't run away.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let me go.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm telling you,

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm not going to let you go.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let me go.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll pay double the price.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can't get out of here no matter how much money you give today.

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then let me die in peace.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Tell me who sent you here.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's okay to tell you.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Blame you for seducing other people's fiancÃ©.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Wei Qing.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You have the guts.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I've recorded everything you said just now.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
As long as something happens to me,

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll upload it to the cloud.

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then the police will know that you killed me.

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But as long as you let me go,

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll delete all these recordings.

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Who told you to set the fire?

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Boss,

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
we didn't set the fire.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's burning in here.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's go.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Open the door.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The meeting is over today.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Mr. Song,

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
something's wrong.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The warehouse where we cooperated with the hospital is on fire.

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What?

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
An Nian.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
An Nian.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
An Nian, wait.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The fire brigade will be here soon.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Move.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
An Nian.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
An Nian.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
An Nian.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
An Nian.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Wake up.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
An Nian.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
An Nian.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What are you doing?

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't go in.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Come out.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let me go.

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
An Nian, you're hurting An Nian.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
An Nian, you're hurting An Nian.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Shut up.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
An Nian.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Shut up.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
An Nian.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
An Nian.

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Qian,

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
you gave up your life to save Gu Nian?

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're the one who set the fire in the warehouse, right?

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Have you ever thought about

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
how troublesome it would be

176
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
if he died in the warehouse where we cooperated with the hospital?

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Qian,

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
why do you think so much about me?

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
How can I think of you?

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're the one who set the fire.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're the one who set the fire.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You're the one who set the fire.

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're the one who set the fire.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
How can you think of me like that?

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How can I think of you?

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The people who set the fire yesterday

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
were caught by me.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They said you ordered them.

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Who told them to bother you?

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Just because of this,

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you asked someone to set the fire.

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I just wanted to scare him.

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Scare him?

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If I didn't arrive in time,

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
he would be dead.

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You care about him?

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Not caring about him,

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm worried about you.

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you know that

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
it's not easy to set the fire?

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
My brother will help me solve everything.

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If the police find the evidence,

204
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
your brother can't do anything.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I just ordered Li Yong to scare him.

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I didn't order him to set the fire.

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Qian,

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
believe me.

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I didn't want to kill him.

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Please help me.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He doesn't want to lie.

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He doesn't want to lie.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If it wasn't him,

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
who wanted to kill Gu Nian?

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yesterday, in the city of Oishi,

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
a woman was caught in an emergency fire

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
in the medical warehouse of Weishi Pharmaceutical.

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The police found a lot of traces of gas around the warehouse.

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The police have never judged the person who died.

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Gu Nian.

222
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Gu Nian.

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The song is only one second

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Disappearing without a trace

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hands shake to break free from the gorgeous cage

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No need to say a word, a knife cuts through the pain

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The endless night is empty, the next is the murderer

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Who is so reckless that it is empty and empty

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let me disappear in the dark

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't see who is hiding behind

231
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
There are still pain in the wound, the memories are still in fear

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
There are two endings, no matter if you understand

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Let me disappear in the dark

234
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I can't see who is hiding behind

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There are still heartbeats, a blood-red face in front of the eyes

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There is only one ending, no matter if it is useful

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let me disappear in the dark

238
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The End
