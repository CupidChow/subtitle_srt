00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,480
Nian, I found out that Song Qian

4
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,240
was in the workplace three years ago.

5
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,520
She has never been to Taicheng

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,720
since she was in the local province.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,080
A month ago,

8
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,920
she officially took over the Wei family

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,200
after she got engaged to Wei Qing.

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,640
She has become the new executive director.

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,240
It seems that

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
she has been promoted.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,040
Could it be that

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,160
she really isn't her?

15
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,040
Qian,

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,000
the female doctor today

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,200
is your friend?

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,480
How could I know her?

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,280
Could it be that you forgot her

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,120
after you lost your job?

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,040
I'm afraid that

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,760
she really knows that

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,280
you are in Taicheng

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,680
and she will threaten you.

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,400
It's better to deal with her as soon as possible.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,040
She is a doctor.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,200
She can't threaten me.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,760
Then don't see her anymore.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,760
She looks like

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,440
an unruly woman.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,200
Okay.

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,160
It's too late.

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
I'll ask Zhao to send you back.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,400
I won't go back.

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,160
I won't go back tonight.

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,040
I'm your fiancee.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
You haven't even touched me yet.

38
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
I was injured before.

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,520
You know that

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,640
I haven't recovered yet.

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,760
I don't care.

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,480
I'm going to be here tonight.

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,880
Be good.

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,160
I have something to deal with with your brother.

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,120
Haozheng,

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,800
send Miss Wei back first.

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,440
Yes.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,720
Miss,

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,920
the secretary who got the certificate

50
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,200
must be dealt with immediately.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,960
Miss Wei,

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,800
I've unlocked the phone of the dean.

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,160
Wei's Drugstore?

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
These photos are all confidential.

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
Could it be

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,240
that the dean's death

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,680
is related to Wei's Drugstore?

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,280
Guiyun,

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,240
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,760
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,080
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,680
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,880
Dr. Gu,

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,400
please wait here for a while.

72
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,600
The representatives of our cooperation

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,560
will be here soon.

74
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,400
Okay, thank you.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
You're welcome.

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,760
What's in the photo?

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,600
Judging from the background,

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,840
it should be the warehouse of Wei's Drugstore.

79
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,560
But how can I find it?

80
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,320
Dr. Gu,

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
I didn't expect that.

82
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480
Mr. Song?

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,560
We met again.

84
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,440
You're the person in charge of the cooperation?

85
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,480
Is it an accident?

86
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,640
I hope we can cooperate happily.

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,960
Let's cooperate happily.

88
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,360
Let's stop here for the morning plan.

89
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,160
Let's call it a day.

90
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,880
Okay, Mr. Song.

91
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,520
Okay.

92
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,160
Dr. Gu,

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,360
let's have lunch together.

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,320
Mr. Song, I'm sorry.

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,640
I've made an appointment with someone.

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,000
It's late.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
I'll leave first.

98
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,440
Okay.

99
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,200
Am I that scary?

100
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,960
Dr. Gu,

101
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,480
you were bothering me two days ago.

102
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,200
Now you're so impatient.

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,920
Mr. Song,

104
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,680
I think you've misunderstood.

105
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,280
We're just cooperating.

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,800
Why are you bothering me?

107
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,120
An Nian.

108
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,800
Senior.

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,520
Dr. Gu,

110
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,640
this gentleman is looking for you.

111
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,600
Why are you here?

112
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,280
I'm here to pick you up for lunch.

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
Okay, I can leave now.

114
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,840
Mr. Song, we'll leave first.

115
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,920
Won't you introduce yourself?

116
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,240
This is the psychologist in our hospital,

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
Dr. Zhou.

118
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,360
This is Mr. Song from Wei's Drugstore.

119
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,200
Hello, Mr. Song.

120
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,720
Are you going to have lunch?

121
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
Mr. Song, we'll leave first.

122
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
Okay, let's have lunch together.

123
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
I happen to have something

124
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,480
to ask Dr. Zhou.

125
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,200
Okay.

126
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,240
Hello.

127
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,040
Hello.

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,080
What would you like to eat?

129
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,960
Help me order.

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,440
How about

131
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
trying our couple meal?

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,960
We're three people.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,760
Three people can also order couple meal.

134
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,400
I want to order couple meal.

135
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,120
Two servings.

136
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,440
Okay, please wait a moment.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,880
Where's Mr. Song?

138
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,000
He...

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,240
He went out for lunch with Dr. Gu.

140
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,840
Dr. Gu?

141
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,200
Gu Nian?

142
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
Miss,

143
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
I'll leave first.

144
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,240
Song Qian,

145
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,440
how dare you lie to me?

146
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,400
Nian,

147
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
have a shrimp.

148
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,120
It's good for your health.

149
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,240
You two seem to be in a good relationship.

150
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,160
Of course we're in a good relationship.

151
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,120
Nian's mother gave it to me.

152
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,920
Of course I have to take care of her for the rest of my life.

153
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,640
By the way, Mr. Song,

154
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,160
aren't you going to ask me a favor?

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,560
I want to ask you

156
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,760
how to treat me

157
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,720
if I have amnesia.

158
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,880
Amnesia?

159
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,720
Then you need to

160
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
go to the hospital for a checkup first.

161
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Then I'll give you a treatment plan.

162
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,240
Then I'll trouble Dr. Zhou.

163
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
Are you Nian's friend?

164
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,840
No trouble.

165
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,400
I still want to thank you.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,720
Eat more.

167
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
It's good for your eyes.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
Mr. Song,

169
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,880
you don't like mango?

170
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm allergic to mango.

171
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,240
You eat it.

172
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,920
I'm allergic to mango.

173
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,840
I'm allergic to mango.

174
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,480
Nian,

175
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,840
what's wrong with you?

176
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm leaving first.

177
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,880
I have to organize the materials.

178
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,880
Nian,

179
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,400
I'll go with you.

180
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,480
No need.

181
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,600
What a coincidence.

182
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,800
I don't like mango either.

183
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,280
Is it a coincidence?

184
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,880
He's also allergic to mango.

185
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,360
I want to ask you

186
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,320
how to treat me

187
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,360
if I have amnesia.

188
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,040
He has amnesia?

189
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
But his shoulder is not injured.

190
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,120
He hasn't been to the hospital either.

191
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,360
Which floor are you going?

192
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,320
The warehouse.

193
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,440
I know the place.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,640
I'll try.

195
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,240
Let's go together.

196
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,320
The warehouse.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,320
Where are the boxes in the photos?

198
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,600
Why is it out of power?

199
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,240
Who?

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,360
Your words are too hard for me to describe.

201
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
What song is it?

202
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
Just for a second,

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,200
it disappears without a trace.

204
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,920
Hands in the air,

205
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,880
break free from the gorgeous cage.

206
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,600
No need to say it,

207
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,960
a pain is gone,

208
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
it's gone.

209
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,200
The endless night,

210
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,920
the empty wind,

211
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
the next is the murderer.

212
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
Who is so unruly?

213
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
Maybe it's empty,

214
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,440
but it's empty again.

215
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,880
Let me disappear in the darkness.

216
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,480
I can't see who is hiding behind.

217
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,640
The wound still hurts,

218
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,120
the memories are still in danger.

219
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,800
There are two endings,

220
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,840
whether you understand or not.

221
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,440
Let me disappear in the darkness.

222
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,120
I can't see who is hiding behind.

223
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,280
The heart still beats,

224
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,760
a blood-red in front of me.

225
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,360
There are two endings,

226
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,400
whether you understand or not.

227
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:22,160
Let me disappear in the darkness.
