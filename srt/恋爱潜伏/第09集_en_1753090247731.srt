1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh

6
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
You can't leave today

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh

8
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh

9
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh

10
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh

11
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,520
You're not there. I'm Nian

12
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,280
You're not there. You're not there. You're not there. You're not there

13
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Don't move or I'll kill you

14
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,960
January

15
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Ah Twin, you're here

16
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,280
Yeah, it's

17
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We tried to save him for a long time.

18
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But he still left.

19
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Xing Geng?

20
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No, I saw the murderer.

21
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The president was killed.

22
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Miss Gu, are you sure you saw someone kill the president?

23
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I didn't see him kill him.

24
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But he was there.

25
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Where is the surveillance camera?

26
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We checked the surveillance camera.

27
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No one went into the president's office.

28
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Miss Gu, if the murderer really exists,

29
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you may be in danger.

30
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Please be careful.

31
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't move.

32
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you move, I'll kill you.

33
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why does this voice sound like him?

34
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If I could find the president earlier that day,

35
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
he might not be killed.

36
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Maybe there's no murderer.

37
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's just a hallucination caused by your anti-drug drug.

38
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Even you don't believe me?

39
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
An Nian, I didn't mean that.

40
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They said the president was killed.

41
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you think the president

42
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
offended someone like the former president?

43
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Didn't president Gu kill himself?

44
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Who knows?

45
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Didn't his daughter say there was a murderer?

46
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't know.

47
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is there a murderer?

48
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This time, it seems that Dr. Gu said there was a murderer.

49
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But I heard that he had a hallucination.

50
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So he didn't say anything.

51
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't mind what they say.

52
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
By the way,

53
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I brought your phone back for you.

54
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is not my phone.

55
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
President, what's wrong with you?

56
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is the president's phone.

57
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What did you say?

58
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It should be their wrong phone.

59
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The president has been in contact with someone.

60
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay, I'll go now.

61
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
At that time, the president's phone was still on the line.

62
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The president did call before the accident.

63
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He refused to cooperate with the U.S.

64
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Do you think he offended

65
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
the new president of the U.S.?

66
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What's wrong with him?

67
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Song Qian?

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think it's Song Qian.

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I heard that he was ruthless.

70
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He was bloodthirsty.

71
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
An Nian, what are you doing?

72
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
An Nian, what are you doing?

76
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm sorry.
