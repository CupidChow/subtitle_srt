00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hey, hey, ha, ha, ha

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey, ha, ha, ha

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, hey, ha, ha, ha

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha

Episode 16

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You stay here and lighten the things again

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, Lord Yang

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I choose you because I like you

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You are a meticulous person

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's just that you just came here and you are not familiar with the food in the mansion

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Start from this thing

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Work out and open your eyes

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you, Lord Yang

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
After this person comes out

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Search carefully for him

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If there is anything wrong, arrest him immediately

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Go

23
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000

Ha, ha, ha, ha

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,100
It's wonderful

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
I won't let you win

53
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,500
sham

54
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,080
who

55
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,080
who are you

56
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,360
what are you doing here

57
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,120
greet me

58
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,480
kill me

59
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm Zang Hai.

60
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
Nice to meet you, Second Young Master.

61
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
You know me?

62
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,280
You're a talented man.

63
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
Everyone in the Marquis' Manor knows you.

64
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
Let me ask you.

65
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,680
As a servant,

66
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,880
why didn't you stay at the Sheren Manor in the middle of the night

67
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,480
and come to the stockade?

68
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,280
I was ordered to collect the money here.

69
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,680
Collect what?

70
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,880
I think you're just picking on me.

71
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,480
I was born in a poor family.

72
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,080
My family is poor.

73
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,680
I've never seen such a rich and prosperous place

74
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,880
with a treasured life.

75
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,280
I knew it.

76
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,880
But my mother taught me since I was little

77
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
that a man should be a man.

78
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,680
A man should be poor and rich.

79
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
No matter how poor I am,

80
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,280
I will never be greedy for wealth and wealth.

81
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm staying here tonight

82
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,680
to follow the orders of Lord Yang.

83
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm not going to stay here.

84
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,080
I'm staying here to follow the orders of Lord Yang.

85
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
If you don't believe me,

86
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
you can go to the house at my door.

87
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,080
Okay.

88
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,480
Since you said that, I'll believe you.

89
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,880
I have something else to do. I'll go now.

90
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
That's strange.

91
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,880
I didn't want to stay for so long when I went out.

92
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,080
Why are you laughing?

93
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Let me tell you.

94
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,680
You're lucky to have met me today.

95
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,080
If you meet my father,

96
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,880
you'll be here in the middle of the night,

97
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,680
and you won't be able to explain it.

98
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,880
Second Young Master, you have a noble identity.

99
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,680
Why are you stealing here?

100
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm not stealing.

101
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm taking it.

102
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,480
The Marquis Manor is my home.

103
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,280
The things in the Marquis Manor are naturally mine.

104
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,680
I'll take a few things to play with them.

105
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,280
Is there any problem?

106
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,280
No problem. Of course, there's no problem.

107
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,280
I'm just talking too much.

108
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
Don't worry, Second Young Master.

109
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,280
I'll treat it as I've never seen you tonight.

110
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,280
Good.

111
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,680
Let's do it then.

112
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,680
This is for you.

113
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
Let's go.

114
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,880
Second Young Master, this...

115
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,080
Why are you still here?

116
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm still in the middle of the night.

117
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,680
It's too late.

118
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Go back.

119
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,720
ester egg

120
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
We can change the rule

121
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,000
Sugar

122
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay

123
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,920
Master

124
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,840
We will go online

125
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,700
We will go into the palace

126
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,180
We will also collect

127
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,680
the old search as his city

128
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,540
Perert

129
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,520
We will also find

130
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,600
the old bridge

131
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,660
That's it

132
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,460
After that

133
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,260
This is the financial banknote?

134
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Please have a look.

135
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,220
Who made this banknote?

136
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,820
It's different from what you wrote before.

137
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,300
A friend wrote it.

138
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,740
Is the question I asked so complicated?

139
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,740
Who wrote it?

140
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,020
A friend called Zang Hai wrote it.

141
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,540
Mr. Feng Shui?

142
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,460
Marquis is so smart.

143
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,820
It seems you have a deep impression of him.

144
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,220
This new servant

145
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,700
doesn't know the rules.

146
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,020
He made Marquis angry.

147
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,740
Please don't be angry, Marquis.

148
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,420
I'll send him away tomorrow.

149
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,380
Who said he made me angry?

150
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,300
In your heart,

151
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,180
I'm such a cruel person.

152
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,740
No, I dare not.

153
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,940
But I'll do my best.

154
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,260
Marquis has seen one of my弟 in our hands.

155
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,700
To make orders,

156
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,500
General PiaoWA is debugging the

157
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,360
살짝al bolus strategy to donít aquilo que rec risen compose a

158
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,380
Do you understand?

159
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,860
You know what it means to do it.

160
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,120
to use nota as a assessment.

161
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,960
Dev opaque

162
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,680
the Tantrum Sword

163
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,580
may House of Compassion be led astray.

164
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,820
Although I know

165
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,060
per大概.

166
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:34,580
I have dryer

167
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,340
For this battle,

168
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,140
I drew all the historical pieces

169
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,600
and 허팝ed the sword

170
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,840
that I was still young

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,240
and had the courage

172
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,040
to necessitate.

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,040
I'm the elderly now.

174
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,080
You're the Vital stimulus

175
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,600
who means the world to you.

176
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,880
The people who work for me

177
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,760
are thanks to me

178
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,320
throughout the war in Sheng

179
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,120
and my motivation.

180
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,840
But few people know

181
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,840
what Lord Yan, Guan Yexi

182
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,280
means to me.

183
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,720
The Zanghai Sea is quite three-营

184
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,140
and something

185
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
but I know him a little.

186
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,840
What does he do in the mansion?

187
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,480
He's like other woodlice,

188
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,400
he's good at books and books.

189
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,360
What do you think of him?

190
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,200
Marquis, you're right.

191
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,760
He's not wrong.

192
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,560
If he's a talent,

193
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,840
you must train him well for me.

194
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,080
You'll be able to relax a lot in the future.

195
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,360
Yes.

196
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,960
I won't let you down.

197
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,480
Thank you for your hard work.

198
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,960
I have my fears on point told.

199
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,520
I though he's important,

200
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,720
but his future is just in front of you

201
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
and it's also the most important thing.

202
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
Simple as that.

203
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,280
Marquis,

204
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,600
it feels weird

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,160
that your old jade sword

206
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,640
is justゲ

207
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,800
more valuable than

208
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,240
yourself today.

209
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,960
But I believe

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,820
принципе

211
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,400
will find the right sword

212
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,840
If you let her go, I'm afraid I won't be able to live well.

213
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,600
I've made her suffer. I'm afraid she won't take revenge.

214
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,800
All these years, there have been many smarter people than her.

215
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,600
Since the Marquis mentioned her,

216
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,600
we should be careful.

217
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,600
Coming.

218
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Young Master Zang, Lord Yang asked you to come to the clinic for a chat.

219
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,800
Okay.

220
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
Good! Good!

221
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,200
Good!

222
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Second Young Master Zhuang owes 500 taels of lotus lotus flower pond to Gou Lan.

223
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
320 taels of peony pond.

224
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,800
850 taels of Xiyue Wine Temple.

225
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,600
170 taels of Yecha Shuangxi.

226
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,800
He also owes 1325 taels of gambling house.

227
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,800
Are you all in charge of the accounting team?

228
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Yes.

229
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Then he owes 3165 taels of the clinic.

230
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
Where is Second Young Master Zhuang now?

231
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
He's in the gambling house.

232
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Bring him in.

233
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Yes.

234
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
Yang Zhen, from Pingjing's Marquis, is here too.

235
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He's in Jing'er Pavilion.

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,600
Is he alone?

237
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,000
Qu Jiao and Chu Huai Ming are also here.

238
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,000
Are they just here to have fun?

239
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,400
I heard that they are going to invite a servant of the Marquis' House today.

240
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,000
His name is Zang Hai.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,800
Zang Hai?

242
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I've never heard of him.

243
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,400
He's here.

244
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,000
It's him.

245
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,800
Keep an eye on him.

246
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Xu Xiao!

248
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,800
Xu Xiao, come.

249
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,200
Let's drink this cup together.

250
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Come, let's do something fun.

251
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,200
Sing in the daytime, and the people who lose drink.

252
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,400
It's fun.

253
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,200
One more sip. This isn't enough.

254
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Lord Yang, don't make fun of me.

255
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,800
I only gave you one sip. Why can't you count?

256
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,000
Of course, I'll use your cherry blossom wine to make a tree.

257
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm from the Zanghai Clan.

258
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,000
Greetings, three lords.

259
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,800
Brother Zanghai, you're here.

260
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,400
Come, come, come. Sit.

261
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
Brother, don't be so formal.

262
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,000
You've been in the house for a long time.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You should also experience

264
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,600
what is the meaning of life and the fragrance of the flowers.

265
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,400
You're paying attention to the articles of His Majesty.

266
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,400
This is a little tip from Brother Yu.

267
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Brother, what do you think?

268
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,400
The three lords are in a good mood.

269
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,200
I just don't know why Lord Yang called me here.

270
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Don't be so formal.

271
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Today is Lord Yang's birthday.

272
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,200
I specially invited you to join us.

273
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,000
So today is Lord Yang's birthday.

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This... this guy didn't prepare anything.

275
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
It's fine that he's here.

276
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,400
You and I are in the Marquis Manor.

277
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,600
We don't see each other often.

278
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
You don't have to be so formal.

279
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,200
You've never seen the culture of the capital before.

280
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Today, let's relax together.

281
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,800
Lord Yang has spoken.

282
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Don't lose the goodwill of Lord Yang.

283
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Thank you, Lord Yang.

284
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,400
Come in.

285
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,200
The Marquis Manor is a place with a lot of wood.

286
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,000
There's only one person who can play the gun under my eyes.

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,200
There's only one person who can make me see through my eyes.

288
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Lord Yang, I don't understand what you're saying.

289
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,400
It's fine if you don't understand.

290
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,600
This beauty was found by me from the capital.

291
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,400
She's born with a good voice.

292
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,200
She's a good voice.

293
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,800
She's a good girl.

294
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,400
Miss, what's your name?

295
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,800
My Lord, my name is Xiao Zhi.

296
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,200
Xiao Zhi.

297
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Then record your good voice and let this young man hear it.

298
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
He just arrived in the capital.

299
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,800
You have to make him like this place.

300
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,400
Yes.

301
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Xiao Zhi nee

302
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,200
Lecturer書

303
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,340
Leaf business

304
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,120
Known for it

305
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,920
Is

306
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,840
I'll waste it.

307
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Absolutely educate yourself.

308
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,240
Forget it.

309
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,840
Forget it.

310
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,200
Just forget it.

311
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,160
Why do you call me here?

312
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,960
Apologize to me?

313
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,160
Ne reduction.

314
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,040
My friends are waiting for me.

315
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,520
Second young master lost again?

316
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,360
Why are you so stubborn?

317
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,160
Mr. Cheng.

318
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,160
Should we pay the money?

319
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,920
I knew you would come to me.

320
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,280
It's not a good thing.

321
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,400
Come on.

322
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,440
As usual,

323
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,280
I'll give you all these.

324
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,560
These things are worth a few dollars.

325
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,360
But I can't pay you.

326
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,560
You know the rules of the clinic.

327
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,640
We'll get the needle in all corners.

328
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,680
Make a living on these.

329
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,000
But last year,

330
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,820
his body was smothered by horse

331
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,600
Producer Dongxia sent.

332
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,920
That's one of the papers

333
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,240
my dad received in the battles,

334
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,480
which didn't have a sh urgank.

335
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Is it?

336
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,600
Then I'll have to

337
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,520
send the note to blade office.

338
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,040
Handsome.

339
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,840
Gorgeous.

340
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,960
So they won't get caught.

341
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Good.

342
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,520
Okay.

343
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,760
Sun Hai.

344
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,520
This girl is receptionist of dasgust.

345
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,200
and took my gift

346
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,080
From now on, we will share wealth and wealth

347
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,200
In the capital, you can choose which girl

348
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I will give you all

349
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,920
It seems that she is too ambitious

350
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,320
I'm afraid she can't

351
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,880
Childe, please take me

352
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
I'm poor and I owe a lot of money

353
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,600
I have to serve...

354
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,000
Thank you for your kindness

355
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm afraid

356
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,440
I just don't know

357
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,640
how I can afford your care

358
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,560
I've been working in the Marquis's Mansion for many years

359
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,320
Marquis is a good man

360
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,440
I know him better than anyone

361
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,320
The Marquis's Mansion is a good place

362
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,280
I always want to find someone

363
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,720
to serve the Marquis with me

364
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,480
But no one is satisfied with me

365
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,720
I've been waiting for years

366
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,040
Now that my brother is here

367
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,880
you are smart

368
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,600
You know the facts

369
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
You know the things

370
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,840
You are not afraid of the consequences

371
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,880
I think you are very kind

372
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,280
I want to promote you to be my assistant

373
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,120
We will work for the Marquis

374
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,880
and share the burden for the Marquis

375
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,960
Thank you for your kindness

376
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,160
OK

377
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,760
The beauty is hard to get

378
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,440
You can have her today

379
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,360
We won't play the game

380
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
of being a man

381
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,720
Thank you for your kindness

382
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,360
But I really don't dare to take this gift

383
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,480
You just promoted you

384
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,680
but you don't appreciate it

385
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,080
You should know

386
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,040
smart people are everywhere

387
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,160
But the real smart people

388
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,440
must be obedient

389
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,400
My lords

390
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,560
I just don't understand

391
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
what will happen

392
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,400
if I don't take this gift

393
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,680
What will happen?

394
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,280
My brother is in trouble

395
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,200
It's OK that you don't appreciate this gift

396
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm not a stingy person

397
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,120
But you just came to the Marquis' mansion

398
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,680
I just promoted you to be my assistant

399
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
You will be reprimanded

400
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,280
I have a good idea for you

401
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,680
I'll give you a good idea

402
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,400
I'll give you a good idea

403
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,880
I'll give you a good idea

404
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,320
Write a letter to the Marquis

405
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,400
and write a novel for him

406
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,480
It takes three years to finish the novel

407
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,360
You can't serve the Marquis during this period

408
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,320
After three years

409
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,520
you will be a great man

410
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,880
and you will be a great scholar

411
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,880
I will introduce you to the Marquis

412
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,640
I will make you the Marquis' favorite

413
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,520
Then no one will hate you

414
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,480
No one will hate you

415
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,040
Zang Hai

416
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Write it

417
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,520
If I don't agree

418
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,120
you will not be a great man

419
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,760
anymore

420
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,400
See you

421
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,000
Only to be because they could.

422
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,640
Your kindness

423
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,560
anti-abortion.

424
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,720
I am word-veping myself.

425
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,280
It's thoughtless

426
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,720
to endure

427
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,680
the three year of hardship.

428
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,440
I can't afford

429
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,160
my lunch.

430
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,360
So I won't

431
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,880
spoil your tackle.

432
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,800
Goodbye.

433
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm a familiar guest here.

434
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Can you let me in?

435
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Lord Qu, don't be angry.

436
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Xiao Zhi, you didn't take care of the old brother of Zang Hai.

437
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
He's leaving.

438
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Lord, please forgive me.

439
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Please forgive me.

440
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Tell me, how should I punish you?

441
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Punish you?

442
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Lord, I beg you.

443
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Please, don't.

444
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
What are you doing?

445
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
What are you doing?

446
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
What are you doing?

447
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Stop it.

448
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
No.

449
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Open your eyes.

450
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Zhang Zeyu.

451
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Stop it.

452
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Stop it.

453
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,400
My lords, I'm from the countryside.

454
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Lord, I don't know how to deal with this situation.

455
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm sorry for the trouble.

456
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Please forgive me.

457
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
I can't be punished.

458
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Since you've given me this girl,

459
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
I'll take her away.

460
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
My lords, you're all here.

461
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
What are you doing?

462
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
This is not a place for weapons.

463
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Isn't this Miss Xiang?

464
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Why are you here?

465
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
I have a message.

466
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Mr. Zhuang wants to see you.

467
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
He's here, too.

468
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
He's here to check the accounts.

469
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Please go and have a look.

470
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
His accounts are not easy to check.

471
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
What do you mean?

472
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Let's go check the accounts together?

473
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
I don't know.

474
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
You'd better talk in person.

475
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
How about this, my lords?

476
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
I'll go to see the second son alone.

477
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
I'll take this girl.

478
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,400
I'll consider Lord Yang's suggestion.

479
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
If you had said so earlier, it would have been fine.

480
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
You're so bad.

481
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Let's go.

482
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Let's go, ladies.

483
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Miss Xiao Zhi.

484
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Is there a clinic nearby?

485
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
There's a doctor in the clinic.

486
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
But it costs a lot to save her.

487
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
No one would care about a dead person like her.

488
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Do you want to save her?

489
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Of course.

490
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Call the doctor.

491
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Her throat is burning.

492
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
It depends on her luck if she's alive.

493
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Doctor.

494
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Please save her.

495
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I'll do my best.

496
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Thank you.

497
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
I'm Zang Hai.

498
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Thanks to Miss Xiang for saving me.

499
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
No need.

500
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
You helped Zhui Lou with the disaster last time.

501
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
It's a draw.

502
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Why did you offend them?

503
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
It's nothing.

504
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Really?

505
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Forget it.

506
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Miss Xiang.

507
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Can you stay in the clinic today?

508
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
I'll go back and get some money.

509
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Don't worry.

510
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
She's dead.

511
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Can she still stay here?

512
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Don't worry.

513
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Zhui Lou will settle her down.

514
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
How can I repay you for saving me?

515
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
I really need your help.

516
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Mr. Zhuang.

517
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Your staff is here to pick you up.

518
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
It's you.

519
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Mr. Zhuang.

520
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Come on.

521
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
We're here.

522
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Be careful.

523
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Mr. Zhuang.

524
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Come on.

525
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Be careful.

526
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Help him up.

527
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Zang Hai.

528
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
See you.

529
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
See you.

530
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Zang Hai, the staff is here.

531
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Come on.

532
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Don't let him down.

533
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
I'll go back to the clinic.

535
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Mr. Zhuang.

536
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
You're here.

537
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Mr. Zhuang.

538
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
You can go back to the clinic.

539
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Thank you.

540
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Mr. Zhuang,

541
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
I'm sorry.

542
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
I'm sorry.

543
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
I'm sorry.

544
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
You're an innocent man.

545
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Do you know who you're facing now?

546
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
A group of people are like grass and a sword.

547
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
There's no bottom line.

548
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
You.

549
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
A gentleman does what he's supposed to do.

550
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
It's not easy to beat them.

551
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Yang Zhen is anxious.

552
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
It means that Pingjing Marquis

553
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
noticed me.

554
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
But it's not enough.

555
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I want to let Pingjing Marquis know

556
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
that I'm more useful than Yang Zhen.

557
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
It's easy to say.

558
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
How many people are there between you and Pingjing Marquis?

559
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
How can you get into his eyes?

560
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Master.

561
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
I can't see him.

562
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
But someone can take me to see him.

563
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
You mean

564
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Zhuang Zhiqin?

565
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
He's not a good actor.

566
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
But he's closer to Zhuang Zhi's mansion than his brother.

567
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I'll go and see him.

568
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
See if he can help me out.

569
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
I'll go and see him.

570
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
I'll go to my room.

571
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Go.

572
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Go.

573
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Greetings, Young Master.

574
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
You're here so late.

575
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
You sent me back to the mansion last night.

576
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I remember it right?

577
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Yes.

578
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
I didn't expect you to come here too.

579
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
I've asked you before

580
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,600
You misunderstood me

581
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,560
I'm a little weak

582
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,320
I dare not come to the whole building

583
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,800
I came yesterday

584
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
to celebrate his birthday

585
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,640
with Lord Yang's invitation

586
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,280
What a coincidence

587
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,400
I don't want to

588
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,200
owe others

589
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,240
I asked you to come today

590
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,320
just to relax

591
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,280
Come on, let's have a bath

592
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,600
You're too serious

593
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,080
It's just my duty

594
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,920
What's your identity?

595
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,040
I dare not be your accomplice

596
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,240
Why do you need my identity?

597
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,000
I asked you to come down

598
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,640
I'll pour tea for Mr. Yang

599
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,160
Whatever

600
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
There are hundreds of

601
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,400
valuable ingredients in this pool

602
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,360
After one bath

603
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,560
you'll feel refreshed

604
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,360
You'll feel happy

605
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,680
It's your loss to make a bath

606
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
I'm so ignorant

607
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,960
I didn't know in the whole building

608
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,560
there is such a place

609
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,480
The district office

610
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,960
is cooperation

611
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,520
or Anti-corruption

612
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,200
Apart from Elliott, PF intéress 대박

613
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,680
I've never had an audition

614
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,560
Fr stumbled

615
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
or

616
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,200
made connections with the boss

617
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,120
Otherwise

618
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,520
even if I was rich

619
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,200
we would have no cause

620
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,480
You're such a

621
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,680
He knows how to enjoy life.

622
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,240
If we don't even know how to eat and play,

623
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,840
what's the point of living?

624
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,960
Young Master and Young Master are busy helping the Marquis.

625
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,960
I didn't expect that they could take time

626
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,320
to arrange their lives in a good way.

627
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,800
I admire them.

628
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,760
I admire them.

629
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,600
I'm so free now.

630
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,560
It's all thanks to my brother.

631
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,560
He doesn't want me to work so hard.

632
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,080
I just help my family do something.

633
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,120
My brother is the one who should be the one to make the most contribution.

634
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,760
But what I did is very important.

635
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,280
Why are you laughing?

636
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,720
Young Master and Young Master are family.

637
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,760
They are close to each other.

638
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,120
They are willing to kill others.

639
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,080
But you are so carefree.

640
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,720
Besides Young Master's care for you,

641
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,880
you are still loyal to Marquis because of your love.

642
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,600
You are right.

643
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,920
My father doesn't need to say much to me.

644
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
To be honest,

645
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,160
my father loves me more than my brother.

646
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,360
Back then, my father took me to ride a horse.

647
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,280
He took me to the army.

648
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,160
I was the only one on his horse.

649
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,960
But now I'm grown up.

650
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,960
I have many things to do.

651
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,840
My father is busy.

652
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,320
He doesn't care about me.

653
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,600
Marquis doesn't care about you.

654
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,880
But he must miss you.

655
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,920
Why don't you take the initiative?

656
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,880
What do you know?

657
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,560
My father cares about me.

658
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,360
I don't need to see him every day.

659
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,920
You are right.

660
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,320
If you want to see him every day,

661
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,480
I have an idea.

662
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,680
Why do you always mention my father?

663
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,520
My dear.

664
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,240
I admire you.

665
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,960
You didn't get a chance to see him after you entered the mansion.

666
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,040
So you were a little bit unruly and rude.

667
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,880
Please forgive me.

668
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,560
I knew it.

669
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,200
The people in the mansion

670
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,440
just want to show their faces in front of my father.

671
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,720
You are honest.

672
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,960
You used your time to pursue the people.

673
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,880
You people

674
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,040
really don't understand.

675
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,440
Your father is a noble man.

676
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,840
He doesn't need to understand

677
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,360
the difficulties of us.

678
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,400
Why don't you listen to my suggestion?

679
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
I will listen to you.

680
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,720
Many people died in the mansion.

681
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,640
It's because they were too smart.

682
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,000
So I think

683
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,520
you should be pure.

684
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,400
You are bold.

685
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,800
It is said that

686
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,180
you don't learn a lot of different

687
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,560
體 pairs.

688
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,720
You're a loser

689
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,860
because you have no other few best motorcycle percent.

690
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,800
She is different

691
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,960
is indeed different

692
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
He used to be

693
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
a spoiled boy

694
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,120
but he still had

695
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,280
the blood and bones of the five generals

696
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Now it seems

697
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,120
they were already rubbed off

698
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,160
He is a real king

699
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,200
But I can see

700
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,440
he wants to attract Pingjing King's attention

701
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,920
This is my chance

702
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,760
Then you have to hurry up

703
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,080
Time doesn't wait

704
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,440
What is it?

705
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,280
Why are you so late?

706
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,080
It is time to go to the city

707
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,600
Hurry greater

708
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,400
the coffin of Imperial Concubine Dowager.

709
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,840
And the late emperor was angry.

710
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,280
Maybe he wants to die.

711
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,080
What are you talking about?

712
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,080
We dare to say that.

713
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,200
Go.

714
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,440
Go.

715
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,560
Ghost.

716
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,240
There's a ghost.

717
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,640
There's a ghost.

718
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,280
The late emperor is in danger.

719
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,880
It's really strange.

720
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,760
Last night, the sound of the knock

721
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,040
was heard in the inn of the late emperor's coffin.

722
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,840
This morning, the craftsmen entered the back hall from the side door.

723
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,160
The late emperor's coffin was not at the original place,

724
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,760
but at the entrance of the inn.

725
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,720
The coffin of Imperial Concubine Dowager Li

726
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,160
just moved out.

727
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,760
The ground was making noise.

728
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Do you know about this?

729
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,360
I haven't had time to report it.

730
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,040
I just came here to discuss with you.

731
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,640
The opportunity is here.

732
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,920
What Mr. Yang means is

733
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,480
to take this opportunity

734
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,880
to push Zang Hai out.

735
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,520
If Zang Hai can

736
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,720
solve the problem of the late emperor's coffin,

737
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,240
it's a good thing

738
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,960
to let him die with him.

739
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,360
But if he can't solve it,

740
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,680
he'll be charged with

741
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,240
a crime that's not good for his job.

742
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,000
It's all a lie.

743
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,840
I'm not lying.

744
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,760
I'm not lying.

745
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
I'm not lying.

746
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
I'm not lying.

747
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I'm not lying.

748
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
I'm not lying.

749
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,760
I'm not lying.

750
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,760
I'm not lying.

751
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
I'm not lying.

752
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
