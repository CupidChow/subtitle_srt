went to the East Xia

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The army of the East Xia was defeated

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and returned to the Great Yong

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The army of the Great Yong was stationed at the East Xia border

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and built a fan tower in the south of the Dan Sui Mountain

The fan tower can be completed in three months

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How is the situation below?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's a little over 1,000 feet

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's almost there

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let them all stop

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000

What happened to them?

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,500

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,300
He is alive.

45
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,300
Just fainted.

46
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,920
Libationer, it's dangerous up ahead.

47
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,000
We can't move forward.

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,300
Libationer.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,720
Go get the rope.

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,240
Okay.

51
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,440

53
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,560
Don't go there.

54
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,800
What we just heard,

55
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,640
could it be them?

56
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,440
Li Zheng,

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,960

58
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,240

62
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,760
This is bad.

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,480
Which end willinated us most do the best

64
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,320

65
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,320
We'll just take this one.

66
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,600
You're still holding the rope 페.

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
You can't go in.

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,520
Back off.

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,440
How dare you laugh at my carriage examples?

193
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,000
I just saw you.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,880
So what?

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,440
You didn't lose your temper.

196
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,720
The Emperor is back!

197
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,360
The Emperor is back!

198
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,040
The Emperor is back!

199
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,560
The Emperor is back!

200
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,040
The Emperor's back!

201
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
What's going on?

202
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Why did you hit me?

203
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,080
How dare you talk to me like that?

204
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
You hit me.

205
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,520
Run!

206
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,200
Run!

207
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,880
Run!

208
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,720
Move aside!

209
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,600
Move aside!

210
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,560
Move aside!

211
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,400
Go away!

212
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,760
Move aside!

213
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,240
Move aside!

214
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,960
Help!

215
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,800
Help!

216
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Help!

217
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Be gentle, Senior Qiao!

218
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
The meat is broken. How can it not hurt?

219
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,800
I have no food. I have limited medical knowledge. I can only give you some medicine.

220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,800
You are really cruel, Feng Ya Duo.

221
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,800
These two holes, one is a line, one is a tree.

222
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
On the back, there is a sword. How did you offend him?

223
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I didn't offend him. I swear to God,

224
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
I just wanted to see if my father was in the car.

225
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Who knows that he would be so angry?

226
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
What is he doing here? So angry?

227
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
You are all so polite.

228
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
You don't even know Princess Dong Xia?

229
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
What did you say? That woman is Princess Dong Xia?

230
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Why did she come to our Imperial Palace?

231
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Princess Dong Xia is an important guest of His Majesty.

232
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
How can she be treated like this?

233
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
What are you talking about?

234
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Let me ask you. Didn't my father come back with you?

235
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Who is your father?

236
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,800
My father is the Emperor of Qing Tian.

237
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,800
You came to help me? You are asking me to draw?

238
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,800
I am thirsty. I want some water.

239
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
What kind of water is this?

240
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,800
You are so drunk and you are even drinking a weird taste.

241
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I won't drink it. Why are you talking so much?

242
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Tell me the truth. Have you seen my father?

243
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I won't tell you. Let's see how you can take me.

244
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
You won't tell me? Beat him!

245
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Are you going to tell me?

246
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Stop it! Stop it!

247
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Stop it!

248
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Stop it!

249
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Are you going to tell me?

250
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
I won't tell you!

251
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
You are all useless if you beat me.

252
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,800
I will beat you to death when I become a general.

253
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Pingjing Duke is back. Why isn't Master back?

254
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
It should be the brothers.

255
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Zhendu, I will go outside and take them.

256
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Gao Shuang, I will leave this place to you.

257
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Let's go.

258
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
My mother made this.

259
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Eat it.

260
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
You must have never eaten such delicious food.

261
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Let me see.

262
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
How is it?

263
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
The ingredients are rough and not delicate.

264
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
But...

265
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
It tastes good.

266
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I don't know you. I don't want to bully you.

267
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I just want to ask you something.

268
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
If you tell me, I will let you go.

269
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
I will let you go.

270
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Then give me some medicine.

271
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
On our way back to the capital,

272
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I heard that the fan was broken.

273
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
The fan was broken?

274
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Yes. Your father couldn't come back.

275
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
When the fan was broken,

276
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,800
the people they saw were buried under the ground.

277
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
You are lying!

278
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
My father's fan couldn't be broken.

279
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
He is the best imperial doctor in the capital.

280
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
The imperial doctor is also a human.

281
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
He is the one who broke the fan.

282
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:23,480
My father's

283
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
I am a little tiger.

284
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Do you think my father really forgot?

285
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
He must have said yes.

286
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
What did he say tonight?

287
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
The seniors said that

288
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
the east dragon's seven-beams have shooting stars.

289
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
But after I came up,

290
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
I saw a sky with a sky of stars.

291
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
It's a miracle.

292
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
This is a miracle.

293
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
This is a miracle.

294
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
This is a miracle.

295
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
This is a miracle.

296
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
This is a miracle.

297
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,200
But after I came up, I didn't see anything.

298
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,680
It's okay.

299
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,640
That's the shooting star of the new show.

300
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,280
Just wait for next year.

301
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,400
As long as you wait patiently,

302
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,680
you can see it.

303
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,360
But when I look at it next year,

304
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,440
dad is not by my side.

305
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,920
When dad is not at home,

306
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,920
you should listen to your mom

307
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,600
and take care of your sister.

308
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,160
When dad comes back,

309
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,880
I'll make you a bigger one.

310
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,680
Okay?

311
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Besides the fish and the fish that dad taught you,

312
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
you should practice more.

313
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,960
You should study hard

314
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,200
and study more.

315
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
If you have any questions,

316
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,560
ask your mom.

317
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,560
Dad is leaving tomorrow.

318
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,800
How about

319
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,520
going to see my big bug with me?

320
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,360
Okay.

321
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,920
Let's go.

322
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,200
Dad, look.

323
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,120
When did you dig

324
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,720
such a big underground tunnel here?

325
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,160
Not long ago.

326
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,640
I dug it up

327
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,840
with the skills that dad taught me.

328
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,080
I also dug a tunnel here

329
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,440
to go to the kitchen.

330
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,040
It's right behind the water bucket.

331
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,880
A few days ago,

332
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,640
the kitchen's dishes were always missing.

333
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,240
It was you who did it.

334
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,560
Don't tell mom.

335
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,680
I have to dig many tunnels

336
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,160
to go to different places.

337
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,920
I have to drink some dry food and water

338
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,280
in the tunnel.

339
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,920
When mom is sitting on me,

340
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
I'll hide for three days and nights.

341
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,320
It's a big project.

342
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,200
When dad comes back,

343
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,200
he will definitely finish the work.

344
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,800
Then dad will see

345
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,400
if I can be a qualified

346
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,680
martial arts break-up wolf.

347
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,400
You are still far from it.

348
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You promise dad first

349
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
not to dig up the house in the house.

350
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,680
Can't help it.

351
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,000
There will be more channels.

352
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,280
The noodles I made

353
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,840
Prawn Noodles

354
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,760
can only be bought

355
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,360
on the internet far away.

356
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:20,860
I wish they could sell ran pint

357
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,680
plum聽

358
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,220
or fresh vegetables for me.

359
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,720
I need to make it wiping.

360
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Pour it on the powder

361
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,500
Mother.

362
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,320
No wonder the people in His Majesty's Mansion

363
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,300
are looking for him.

364
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,400
You hid him here!

365
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,900
Mother, I didn't�et him in.

366
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,040
But why?

367
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,000
Shut your mouth.

368
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
After he was gently injured,

369
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,480
you even tied him up.

370
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,640
Such asix-pack!

371
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,840
Looks like he got very lucky this time.

372
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,340
Tomorrow,

373
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,800
After he heard about this,

374
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll send him home and apologize to him.

375
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,880
But his father is Pingjing Duke.

376
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,880
He will definitely complain to his father.

377
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,160
Who will complain?

378
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
Who is the little dog?

379
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,080
When I recover,

380
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,120
I'll fight with you when I come back.

381
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,520
Come on, I'll send you home.

382
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,400
Come on.

383
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,200
You made a big mistake.

384
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,120
You can't be forgiven.

385
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,320
Guan Feng.

386
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,920
You can go to the back mountain to chop firewood for ten days.

387
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,640
You can't go down the mountain until you're done.

388
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,560
Gou Sheng.

389
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,880
You'll be punished for sweeping the toilet for a month.

390
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,080
You can't come here.

391
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,600
As for you,

392
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
you can't play with the land

393
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,840
and you can't gamble it.

394
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,600
Mother.

395
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,000
You can punish me for anything.

396
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,320
Don't let me gamble on the land.

397
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,760
I want to show it to my father.

398
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,560
It's him.

399
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,480
He said my father was buried in the ground.

400
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,480
I'll...

401
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,360
Stop talking nonsense.

402
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,680
Let's go.

403
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,240
Brother, what are you doing?

404
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,160
Get lost!

405
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,320
Brother, eat some candy.

406
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,840
I don't eat your food.

407
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,080
You're acting like you're scared.

408
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,040
Brother, I'm sorry.

409
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,800
Get a pair of mutual use boots

410
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
and put on some Henriette attires.

411
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,320
Father!

412
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,040
I thought you were dead.

413
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,240
I'm fine.

414
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm back.

415
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,920
It's good that you're back.

416
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,920
It's good that you're back.

417
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,080
Hurry and pack up.

418
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,520
Call everyone.

419
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,120
Leave the capital tonight.

420
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,920
Leave tonight?

421
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,920
What happened?

422
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,320
There's no time to explain.

423
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,920
I'll explain it to you on the way.

424
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Go.

425
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
Call the maidservant first.

426
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,720
Hurry, Zhinu.

427
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Hurry.

428
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Hurry.

429
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Hurry.

430
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Hurry.

431
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,520
Zhinu, call everyone.

432
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Hurry.

433
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,520
Yuan Nuo, wake up.

434
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
I'll hold you.

435
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,720
Mother, what's wrong?

436
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Father is back.

437
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Father is back.

438
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Huo, wake up.

439
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,920
Wake up.

440
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
My father is back.

441
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,120
Gou Sheng.

442
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Huo, wake up.

443
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Get up.

444
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Get up.

445
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
What's wrong?

446
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,320
Gou Sheng, my father.

447
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
My father is back.

448
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,120
Master.

449
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Master.

450
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Master.

451
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Get up.

452
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,920
Everyone, pack up quickly.

453
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,920
We have to leave here tonight.

454
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Where are we going?

455
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Who's up there?

456
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Run.

457
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Run.

458
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Run.

459
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Are you okay?

460
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,920
Take your sister to hide in the grass in the back yard.

461
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,320
Without mother's order, you can't come out.

462
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,720
Mother, is it because of me?

463
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
I made a mistake.

464
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I'll admit it myself.

465
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,120
Be good. It's not your fault.

466
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Go.

467
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Go.

468
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Hurry.

469
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Go.

470
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,520
Yuan Nuo, hide in there.

471
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,920
You hide here and hide from the students.

472
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,320
I'll go and have a look.

473
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Wait for me.

474
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
Go.

475
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,120
Real last words.

476
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Instable Quite,

477
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,120
I haven't seen you in a long time.

478
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,440
Marquis Marquis comes

479
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,320
for a sudden reason.

480
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,040
Why did you come back to the capital without permission?

481
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,960
I'm guilty.

482
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,520
Is it the crime of corruption in Fengshan Terrace

483
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,480
or the crime of taking what you shouldn't have?

484
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,680
I don't understand what you mean.

485
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,560
I heard that Lord Kwai has two sons and two daughters.

486
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,440
Qi Jiang,

487
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,520
find them out.

488
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,320
When the child comes,

489
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,000
Lord Kwai might understand.

490
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,880
Yes.

491
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,760
I'm guilty.

492
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,760
I should be punished by the court.

493
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,560
I'm the court.

494
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,880
Hand over the thing.

495
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,560
I'll spare your life.

496
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,000
I don't understand what you want.

497
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,320
Then don't blame me for being rude to you.

498
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,080
Qi Jiang.

499
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,640
Hange!

500
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,240
Run!

501
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,760
If you want to kill me,

502
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,600
spare these children.

503
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,520
They are innocent.

504
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You're a good man.

505
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,480
I won't kill you.

506
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,120
But you have to watch them

507
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,800
die because of you.

508
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,720
Zou Luo Yin.

509
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,760
Look at what I'm about to do.

510
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,600
Let's go.

511
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,400
Hurry.

512
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,040
Quickly, hide.

513
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,520
This

514
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,640
will be given to save you.

515
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,840
Qi Sissi

516
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,920
I'm sorry.

517
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,720
Series

518
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,200
Thank you.

519
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,080
Come.

520
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,240
I'll take you to see your parents.

521
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,960
Go.

522
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,560
My lord.

523
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,280
Ye Nong.

524
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,560
Dad, mom.

525
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,600
Ye Nong.

526
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,320
Gui Duo.

527
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,480
Why?

528
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,440
You were dead

529
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,800
when Fengshan was attacked.

530
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,600
What I want is

531
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,400
the thing you took back from the Eastern Xia.

532
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,200
As long as you hand it over,

533
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,960
I'll make it clear to the emperor for you.

534
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,640
If you really think so,

535
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,240
will you kill so many people?

536
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,600
These people are all rotten.

537
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,160
We can take new ones.

538
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,480
But if you don't let go,

539
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,280
not only the disciples will die.

540
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,040
I'll kill your son first.

541
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,680
Then your daughter.

542
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,440
Don't kill him.

543
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,880
He's my only son.

544
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,880
We know you have a ten-year-old son.

545
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,640
Little boy.

546
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,600
Is he your father?

547
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,320
Dad, mom.

548
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm not afraid of death.

549
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,600
I'm not afraid of death.

550
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,040
I'm not afraid of death.

551
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,640
I'm not afraid of death.

552
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,080
I'm not afraid of death.

553
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,440
I'm not afraid of death.

554
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,920
I'm not afraid of death.

555
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,880
Mom, I'm not afraid of death.

556
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,320
Dad.

557
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,640
Don't shoot him.

558
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,480
You only have one daughter left.

559
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,600
Take it off.

560
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,880
Dad, mom.

561
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,480
Mom.

562
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,360
Mom.

563
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,600
Yanluo.

564
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,480
Hurry up.

565
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,920
Don't be afraid.

566
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,200
Yanluo.

567
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,000
Mom is here.

568
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,360
I'm sorry.

569
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,320
I'm sorry.

570
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,760
Spring лишal.

571
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,520
Dreamись screening strawberry begone.

572
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,240
owingwe are separated into two.

573
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Brother.

574
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,120
Now you have your wife.

575
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,480
I will take her back.

576
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,080
Cut off her fingers.

577
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,520
Can you still keep your mouth shut?

578
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,680
Stop.

579
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,040
Stop!

580
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:58,920
I must let them get what they want.

581
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
Mother.

582
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Mother.

583
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Mother.

584
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Mother.

585
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Don't take what you want.

586
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,920
But even if you turn this place upside down,

587
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
you won't find him.

588
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,920
You will never get the way back.

589
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Don't let him.

590
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Don't let him.

591
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Mother.

592
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
My Lord.

593
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Someone has been watching us here.

594
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
After we get him,

595
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
we can't hide anything.

596
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Search him.

597
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Yes.

598
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
Mother.

599
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
My Lord.

600
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
It's almost dawn.

601
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
You know what to do?

602
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Yes.

603
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Search everything.

604
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
Take him away.

605
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
Yes.

606
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Mother.

607
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Put out the fire.

608
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Mother.

609
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Mother.

610
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,920
Mother.

611
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
Mother.

612
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,920
Mother.

613
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
Mother.

614
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,920
Mother.

615
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Mother.

616
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,920
The sun rises like the sun sets.

617
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Sing with the Lord.

618
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,920
I am in your dream.

619
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,920
I am the beast.

620
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,920
I am the world.

621
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,920
I am the world.

622
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,920
You are me.

623
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,920
I am the world.

624
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,920
I am the world.

625
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,920
I am the world.

626
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,920
I am the world.

627
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,920
I am the world.
