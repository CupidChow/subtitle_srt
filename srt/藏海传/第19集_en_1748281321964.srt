Episode 18

2
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,720
Mr. Zhuang.

3
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm looking for your Lord Zang.

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,480
He went out at night.

5
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,560
He hasn't come back yet.

6
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,000
Do you know where he is?

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
I don't know.

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm afraid he has some business.

9
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
You should go back to headphones.

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,960
I must explain something to him.

11
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,440
Fine.

12
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,480
Wait until headline Li comes back.

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,200
Tell him for me.

14
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,880
I'll go my way his way.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,040
She told me, she went to the court today

16
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
She had a date with my friends

17
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,320
Last night

18
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,480
and invited us to her house

19
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,040
Do you have to 50 take-away everyday?

20
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,320
I am not waiting for her

21
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,600
I just want to see her

22
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,360
Depth of bus to now

23
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,840
has missileized her body

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,320
Come and take the medicine

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Miss, Lord Zang is here.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Where is he?

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He's downstairs.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's wrong?

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're so close to him.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You don't dare to do that again?

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've waited for so long.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have to see him as soon as he comes.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's no such thing as that in this world.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll let him wait for me today.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Since Lord Zang is so patient,

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wang Liu, take him to Liutao Pavilion.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What are you doing again?

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Lord Zang, please wait.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Our Miss will be here soon.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Kill!

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Kill!

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Kill!

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Kill!

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Kill!

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Shen Xiaoxin, you stay in this camp.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Go in.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There are so many people.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where do I live?

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What?

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You want me to find a place for you?

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is a military camp, not a hotel.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Find it yourself.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He doesn't want to live in a single house, does he?

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can't live in a single house?

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why are you laughing?

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Be honest with me.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
From today on, he's your man.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Shen Xiaoxin, go back to your room.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why are you standing here? Go.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They don't like us, the rough guys.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We're too much.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Look at you, so delicate.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So I think you'd better call him Young Master Shen.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think you're fine.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Young Master, are you okay?

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Get up!

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you okay?

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Are you going to cry?

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Young Master is going to cry!

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm going to cry

72
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,000
How dare you

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
Do you know who I am?

74
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,320
You

75
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,680
Who?

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,240
General Shen

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
General Shen came to us

78
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,600
and was wronged

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,800
It's General Shen

80
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,320
You scared me to death

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
Go

82
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,280
Someone is here

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,360
What should we do, young master?

84
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,840
The place at the door is good

85
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,440
The wind blows down, you block it

86
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
You can still see the enemy

87
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,480
Look at the view from the brother and sister

88
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,320
Did Sanghai make any noise?

89
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,240
He's not impatient at all

90
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,440
He's sitting there

91
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,200
and didn't even frown

92
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,120
Come on

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,760
Sanghai

94
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,720
is sitting there and drinking tea

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,000
He's not inferior

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
He's really good

97
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,200
You said

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,560
Where is the man's patience?

99
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
Where is his love?

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
I told him to wait for me for two hours

101
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Isn't it too much?

102
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
I just don't know

103
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,360
Are you torturing him

104
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,400
or yourself?

105
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
How is it?

106
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,760
Is it beautiful?

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600
I've never seen such a beautiful woman

108
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,080
I'm afraid I can't take Sanghai's eyes away

109
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,240
Then invite him up

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,840
Yes

111
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,920
Forget it

112
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,680
I'll go down and find him myself

113
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Miss Hongliu

114
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,520
Is Miss Xiang not done yet?

115
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,200
Sir, please sit down

116
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Have some more tea

117
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,960
Our Miss will be fine in a while

118
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
This is the sixth cup of tea

119
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,920
If you drink more, your mouth will start to bubble

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Please tell Miss Xiang

121
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,680
I have work to do today

122
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,560
I'll come another day

123
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,200
Sir, won't you wait a little longer?

124
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,280
I think I understand

125
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,360
what Miss Xiang means

126
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,800
Sir, what are you talking about?

127
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,520
Wait a little longer

128
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,160
I'll go ask

129
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,800
No need

130
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank her for me

131
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,440
Goodbye

132
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,680
Thanks

133
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,880
They're all Star- prevention medicines

134
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,240
My lord

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,360
You will be coming back again

136
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,920
I will

137
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,960
Miss.

138
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,680
Could he be waitingclamation?

139
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
Has he been akuutiquing us?

140
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,800
Lord Zang said that there was some official material and addressed him.

141
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,100
He has left.

142
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,320
Miss.

143
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,200
Who are you?

144
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,760
I'm looking for unexpected person.

145
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,600
No one there is waiting for somebody.

146
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
Ye Linea

147
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
Last optimist

148
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,480
Why is there a little bit performers here?

149
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,180
She

150
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,200
just went away

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,720
Miss

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,160
He seems to have misunderstood

153
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,760
He believed you changed your mind

154
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,800
What did he say when he died?

155
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
He said

156
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,280
He knows what you're thinking

157
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,760
I can wait for him.

158
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,240
Can't he wait for me?

159
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm not someone

160
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,560
he can meet whenever he wants.

161
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,320
My Lady,

162
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,200
it might be too late

163
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,080
to chase after him now.

164
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,960
Why?

165
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,440
Fine.

166
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,320
Since he's so brave,

167
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,320
I won't serve him then.

168
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
If he comes here again,

169
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,440
just tell him I'm not here.

170
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,880
Let him go.

171
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Where's Fang bomb?

172
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,400
Yes.

173
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,080
Master.

174
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,680
What are you doing here?

175
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,840
What about him?

176
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,560
He didn't see me before.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,840
I know he's upset.

178
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,280
If I really see him,

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,280
how can I say these words?

180
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,200
But then I thought it over.

181
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,120
Rather than seeing him and being sad,

182
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,440
I'd rather be disappointed.

183
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,640
I'll just ignore him.

184
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Maybe it's the best result

185
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,200
if I don't see him.

186
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,160
I don't want to drag him

187
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
into this rotten pit of revenge.

188
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,440
He's close to me.

189
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,040
It'll be dangerous.

190
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,320
I've been waiting for too long.

191
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,840
Now the blue sky has been cleared.

192
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
I'm going to find the third person.

193
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,720
Let me tell you something.

194
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,520
Zhuang Zhixiang has gone to the camp.

195
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,440
He came to say goodbye to you this morning.

196
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,240
You weren't there.

197
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,160
He's quite quick.

198
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,080
Hai,

199
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,360
do you really think he can go on?

200
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,760
Who's there?

201
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,280
Aren't you the new soldier

202
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,440
who joined the camp today?

203
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,680
Why are you here?

204
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,280
You must have been bullied

205
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
by those brats.

206
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,840
Let's go.

207
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,120
Stay with me tonight.

208
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
If you stay here for one night,

209
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,120
you'll be in trouble.

210
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,320
My name is Xiang Hong.

211
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,320
I'm the chief of the third cavalry.

212
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,920
The former commander of the neighboring army

213
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,400
who went to the front line

214
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,280
was killed.

215
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,080
The one who was left behind

216
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,880
was killed.

217
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,840
The one who didn't join the army

218
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,680
was killed.

219
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,360
The one who didn't join the front line

220
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,240
was killed.

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,320
The one who ran away from the carriage

222
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,040
was killed.

223
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,200
The one who was ordered by the chief

224
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,280
was killed.

225
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,680
The one who was ordered to be killed

226
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,440
was killed.

227
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,640
You.

228
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,520
It's you.

229
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,280
What are you doing?

230
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,080
Stand still.

231
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,360
What are you doing?

232
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,320
Chief Huizong,

233
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,360
I have something on me.

234
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,680
How dare you talk back?

235
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,480
Come out.

236
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,360
What's your name?

237
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,600
Shen Xiaoxing.

238
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,920
You're not a good soldier.

239
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,120
Stand still.

240
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,440
What's your name?

241
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,040
Zhang Shi.

242
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,680
He almost got a tear.

243
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,480
Among ten sentries,

244
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,240
one of them talked back to the other.

245
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,000
Seriously!

246
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
Who was I?

247
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
Isn't he Mr. Shen?

248
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
You put the bug on me, right?

249
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,760
I'm just kidding.

250
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,720
You're not afraid of the chief commander?

251
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,640
What are you looking at?

252
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,520
Eat

253
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,040
Go

254
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,880
Go

255
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,680
Go

256
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,480
Go

257
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Go

258
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Go

259
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Go

260
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Go

261
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Go

262
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Go

263
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
Go

264
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Go

265
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Go

266
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Go

267
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Go

268
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Go

269
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
Go

270
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Go

271
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Go

272
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Be patient

273
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,680
This medicine is good for the head

274
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,480
But it's not effective

275
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
It will be cured in less than seven days

276
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,480
I never harassed them

277
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,080
Why are they targeting me like this?

278
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,680
Come on, sit down

279
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
Slow down

280
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,080
A person above the group, moresoft as a queen

281
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,680
The weaker you are, the more you are despised

282
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,480
After all, we'll enter the battlefield

283
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,080
You would die sooner or later

284
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,080
No one would like to fight Tuo Youping

285
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
But when you become strong

286
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
they won't do this to you

287
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,040
Then why didn't you bully me

288
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,200
instead help me

289
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,880
You're not afraid that I'll Carsick Doldom after dragging you down a little?

290
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I'll drag you down.

291
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,880
You may look weak,

292
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
but you're very stubborn.

293
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,880
Zhan Hao is so strong.

294
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,400
You even fought with him.

295
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,040
From this point,

296
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,720
you're worthy of being called a brother.

297
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,960
Besides,

298
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,520
you won't drag me down.

299
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,880
You'll be strong in the future.

300
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,240
Do you believe me?

301
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
You were beaten by Zhan Hao

302
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,320
just to help me.

303
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,400
It's nothing.

304
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
For a brother,

305
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,800
it's nothing.

306
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I have another good thing.

307
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,520
I can't bear to drink

308
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,200
the hurt Chu Yueqing.

309
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,960
Don't you have a glass of wine?

310
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
What kind of wine?

311
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,960
Have a big mouth.

312
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,520
Try it.

313
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,720
I'll drink it.

314
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,000
It's really a pleasure to drink like this.

315
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,920
In the future, we'll eat meat and drink wine.

316
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,920
It's more delicious.

317
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,640
You rest first.

318
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,360
I'll go to the other camp.

319
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,840
Xiao Hong, thank you.

320
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,040
Before I came, I thought

321
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
the days in the camp would be hard.

322
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,040
I didn't expect

323
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,560
I could make friends like you.

324
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,840
Have a good rest.

325
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,480
You're really bold.

326
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,080
You dare to bully him.

327
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,480
Do you know who he is?

328
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,040
I don't care who he is.

329
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,280
I've seen

330
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,160
a little white face like him.

331
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,040
Okay, I'll tell you.

332
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,960
He's the second son of Pingjing Duke,

333
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,040
Zhuang Zhixing.

334
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,680
Really?

335
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,360
How do you know?

336
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,280
I saw him

337
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,080
at the year of the no-fighting game.

338
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,160
This face is not wrong.

339
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,840
I don't know why he

340
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,160
came here secretly.

341
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
But I know

342
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,560
we can't afford to offend him.

343
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,440
He's dead.

344
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Where is he?

345
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,680
Oh, no.

346
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,960
Oh, no.

347
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,960
No wonder you've been

348
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,160
trying to please him.

349
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,200
You knew his identity

350
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,320
from the beginning.

351
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

352
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,840
I beat him up like that today.

353
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,560
He went back to tell his father.

354
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,240
I can't live.

355
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,360
Okay.

356
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,440
You're lucky.

357
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,680
I'll make him happy.

358
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,880
He's a good man.

359
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,720
He's simple and good-natured.

360
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,920
You can talk to him

361
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,960
and follow him.

362
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
As long as he's happy,

363
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
he won't tell you.

364
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,160
Yuxing,

365
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,000
why are you out?

366
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,320
You knew my identity from the beginning.

367
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,240
You helped me many times.

368
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,840
I thought

369
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,760
you were good to me

370
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,920
without any selfishness.

371
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Qing, you grew up in the Heng's Mansion.

372
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,360
You don't understand that

373
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,320
there are many things in this world...

374
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,120
If I wasn't a poor man,

375
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,760
you wouldn't have helped me

376
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,760
when Qin Rizhang hit me.

377
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,040
That's why you said

378
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,160
you believed I would become stronger.

379
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,440
You were born in a family of armed soldiers.

380
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,640
You won't be weak.

381
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,240
So it's because of my father.

382
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,560
I thought you were a real man.

383
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,440
You really wanted to be my friend.

384
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,600
I thought you saved me

385
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,840
because of me.

386
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,880
You're the son of the pervert.

387
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,640
You can't lose your identity no matter where you go.

388
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,640
Besides,

389
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,440
you have no other interests.

390
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,160
We're not related.

391
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,880
Why should we be nice to you?

392
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,760
You're overacting.

393
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,440
You can't call her.

394
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,400
You can't say it to DIDU.

395
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,400
It's my time now.

396
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,200
No.

397
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,520
Stop it.

398
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,640
Stop

399
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,040
Stop

400
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,680
Where are you going?

401
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,240
Why are you here?

402
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,280
Escaping is a capital crime

403
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,000
Come with me

404
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,760
Luckily, you met me today

405
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,480
Otherwise, you would be in big trouble

406
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,960
Why are you so embarrassed?

407
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,680
Eat

408
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,320
I'll send you back after eating

409
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,600
If I say

410
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,760
I don't go back to the camp

411
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,760
Am I not

412
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
unconditionally good

413
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
between people?

414
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,760
People in this world

415
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,200
have their own pursuits and goals

416
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,560
Few people will make a sacrifice without taking the reward

417
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,200
What about you?

418
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,160
If I'm not the son of the Marquis

419
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,720
will you approach me?

420
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,480
If I have no hatred for my father

421
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,360
I will never betray him

422
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,640
Will you ally with me?

423
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,960
If I can't find out

424
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,360
the secret of that year

425
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,960
will you help me?

426
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,680
I know

427
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,640
I know

428
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,720
In this world

429
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,160
there is only one person

430
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,320
who is good to me

431
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,200
That person is my mother

432
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,680
But she is dead

433
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,880
I hope you will remember

434
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,480
how she died

435
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,960
You don't have to send me off

436
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,400
I'm going back

437
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,840
Please

438
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Lord

439
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,320
Shi

440
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,240
Master

441
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,800
Shi

442
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,360
Great

443
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
I should thank you

444
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,120
Although you are the only three officials left

445
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,720
you were the only one who did the real thing

446
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,480
You can't make any mistakes

447
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,880
I will consider the new candidates

448
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
You are so powerful

449
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,480
I think I am out of line

450
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
No one listened to your suggestion

451
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,200
It's Chu Huai Ming's problem

452
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
The officials are not for the people. Why should they be the officials?

453
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,160
I won't be involved in this kind of situation

454
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Your Excellency

455
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Chu Huai Ming's remains have been in the warehouse for a long time

456
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Should we take care of it directly or do you want to see it again?

457
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Give it to me

458
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
I will take care of it

459
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,160
I will take care of it

460
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
It's not him

461
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
He is a big figure in the capital

462
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,160
His Majesty's brother, Prince Yongrong

463
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Prince Yongrong?

464
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Not many people know about this

465
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Chu Huai Ming asked Shi Quan to help him find the remains

466
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
Shi Quan revealed it to me

467
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,160
After Chu Huai Ming became the spy of the Qingtian Sword

468
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
he had no way to survive

469
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,160
But he never gave up on the power of the capital

470
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Prince Yongrong

471
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Be careful

472
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
is the best choice

473
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,120
But the common coins can't be used for Prince Yongrong

474
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Only the whole set of real and transparent treasures can attract his interest

475
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
But Chu Huai Ming failed to find the power

476
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,120
He lacked one and folded it three times

477
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
I have a guess

478
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Chu Huai Ming wants to get rid of Yongrong

479
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Does he know that Yongrong is behind the Marquis Pingjing and Cao Jinxian?

480
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
It's possible

481
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
But he only has one coin

482
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,080
and he still thinks Yongrong is the third person

483
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
It's not enough

484
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,080
But this is the only clue

485
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,080
The third person didn't show up for so many years

486
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Marquis Pingjing and Cao Jinxian are willing to hide his identity

487
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I still think

488
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,040
his identity is not necessarily lower than them

489
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Maybe even higher than them

490
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
There are not many people like him

491
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Yongrong is one

492
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Yongrong

493
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Yes

494
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
What?

495
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's almost the day when the local officials will be on duty

496
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
According to the court

497
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
they can stay in the capital for a day after the duty

498
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And then?

499
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Prince Yongrong loves to have fun

500
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He will hold a banquet every time to invite local officials

501
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Many famous people in the capital will be invited

502
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What if I can go to the night banquet of Prince Yongrong?

503
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
I can investigate him

504
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,960
and these important people

505
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
Right

506
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
But master

507
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
I'm just a small witness

508
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
I won't make friends with Prince Yongrong

509
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Is there any way to invite me to the banquet?

510
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,960
You are just a little boy

511
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,960
If I can go to the capital, I can't find him

512
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
I will take care of it

513
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Okay

514
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,360
Greetings, Your Highness

515
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,440
Lords

516
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,440
This is the private..?

517
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,440
How is the investigation for the funeral

518
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,440
and ру Maple change?

519
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
The state although he is new

520
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,040
It makes strict behavioral newest

521
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,640
and investigate so many problematic officials and nobles.

522
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Sanghai is just a mere martial art.

523
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,040
If we investigate it in this list,

524
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,440
we will offend all the court officials.

525
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,440
How should we establish Qingtian Sword?

526
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,440
This is a new official's task. Three fire.

527
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,840
What three fire?

528
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,840
Your Highness.

529
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,040
I am here today for nothing.

530
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,640
I am here to gather some fun in the Inner Council.

531
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,840
You didn't delay the official affairs, did you?

532
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,040
No, no.

533
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Your Highness.

534
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,240
Grand Secretary Shi, who did you just mention?

535
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,240
The newly appointed Qingtian Sword Provincial, Sanghai.

536
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Sanghai?

537
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Sanghai?

538
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,240
The one who fought with Chu Huai Min on the sky?

539
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Interesting.

540
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I didn't expect that Lord Zang

541
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,240
could set the fire so high.

542
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,240
What do you think of this matter?

543
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,240
In my opinion, let's examine the list first.

544
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Let's see if these people are as Qingtian Sword said,

545
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,240
they did so many things that hurt the heavens.

546
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Since the old emperor established the rules of the capital investigation,

547
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
he has been doing this for six years.

548
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,240
He will meet with officials every time.

549
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,240
He will examine the situation from top to bottom.

550
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,840
Since we have this list,

551
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840
let's start this year's investigation from these people.

552
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,040
Let's see how long this fire can last.

553
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,640
Good.

554
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,240
I want to see what surprise Lord Zang can bring.

555
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Come.

556
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Don't be afraid.

557
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Slowly.

558
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
How is it, Master?

559
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
I've been to all the capital.

560
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I've never been to the black market.

561
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
I've asked around.

562
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
It's strange.

563
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,240
All the money was bought away.

564
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
I finally asked

565
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,240
if there was a treasured copper coin at the auction.

566
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,240
It's the money.

567
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,240
I went there after I had a good review.

568
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
But I was late.

569
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
It was bought away at a high price.

570
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240
You're so stubborn.

571
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Guess who bought it?

572
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Xiang Andu.

573
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,240
We underestimated him.

574
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,240
How did he get the money Kuguo was looking for?

575
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
He was targeting you.

576
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Otherwise, it wouldn't be so coincidental.

577
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,240
It's appropriate to go to the capital next time.

578
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Wait three more years.

579
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,240
I'll think of another way.

580
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Maybe there are other ways

581
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,240
to find Zhe San.

582
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
I'll go look for it.

583
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Go ahead.

584
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Go.

585
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
That's right.

586
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I'm even more embarrassed

587
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
if you can't find it.

588
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Hai.

589
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
With this skill,

590
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
why don't you think about it

591
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
and get it from Boss Xiang?

592
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
How can I get it from him?

593
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Whether it's Zhe San's money

594
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
or the treasured coin,

595
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,240
they're all in the building.

596
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,240
It's a scheme.

597
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
You can't avoid it.

598
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
How much did he spend

599
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
on the coin?

600
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
500 taels.

601
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,240
He's really good at it.

602
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Okay.

603
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Let's prepare 1,000 taels.

604
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,240
Where can I find 1,000 taels?

605
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Where's Fang Xi?

606
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
You thief!

607
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,240
You want to give him the house?

608
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
I'll live with him.

609
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
It's not that important.

610
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
We need to be sincere.

611
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Let's go to the inn first.

612
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
We can save the money

613
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
for the food and drinks.

614
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,240
Save what?

615
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Hai, I'll think of a better way.

616
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
I have no other way.

617
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
How about this?

618
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
You go to the building tomorrow

619
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,240
and give him the house and the land.

620
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Me?

621
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
What's the use of me?

622
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
He's forcing you.

623
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
If I go,

624
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
I'll give you 2,000 taels.

625
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
What will you do?

626
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
I have no other way.

627
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,240
You'd better beg Boss Xiang.

628
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
You can't run away from any mistake.

629
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
As long as you make him happy,

630
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Boss Xiang won't make it hard for you.

631
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,240
It's not a matter of whether I beg or not.

632
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,240
I've decided to focus on revenge.

633
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
No matter what his purpose is,

634
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
I've already made my choice.

635
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Let's talk about it later.

636
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
The family is gone.

637
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
It's all gone.

638
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Why don't you think about it again?

639
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,240
The memory doesn't stop

640
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,240
One pair of eyes, one pair of hands

641
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Fate is like a broken glass

642
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,240
The light in the dark

643
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,240
How I wish to keep it

644
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Fate is a trick

645
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,240
How absurd it is

646
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:10,240
The small things are for the sake of the big things

647
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,240
The people are deep in the heart

648
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,240
How crazy this life is

649
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,240
The north wind is cold

650
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,240
How crazy this life is

651
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
The world is changing

652
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
When you get on the battlefield,

653
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
there is only one dead end.

654
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,240
There is no regret

655
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,240
How can I forget

656
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,240
How can I forget

657
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,240
this life

658
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:57,240
The south wind is cold

659
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,240
The tears outside the window

660
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,240
are left in the year of the ox

661
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,240
When the world is over,

662
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,240
I turn around and hide

663
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
You usually laugh at me.

664
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Now you don't say anything.

665
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
I'm not used to it.

666
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,240
Who dares to fight with you like this?

667
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,240
Didn't you say you wouldn't be with him anymore?

668
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
He can hold his temper.

669
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Since he left last time, he never came again.

670
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Instead, he has been sending people to find Gu Bi.

671
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,240
Didn't you say you wouldn't see him again?

672
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
You want to drive him away?

673
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Then he has to come first.

674
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
Miss, Mr. Zang is here.

675
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,240
He just said that he would come.

676
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
Invite him to Liutao Pavilion.

677
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Yes.

678
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Mr. Zang has a good fruit to eat.

679
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Mr. Zang, today,

680
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Han Shuo is really in a good mood.

681
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
I left in a hurry that day.

682
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
I didn't get Mr. Xiang.

683
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Please forgive me.

684
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
Which day?

685
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
The day when I was in the hospital.

686
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Which day?

687
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
When did you come to me?

688
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Why don't I remember?

689
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
It's my fault.

690
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
But Mr. Xiang forced me to come today.

691
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
He must know what I'm doing.

692
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Don't be so self-willed.

693
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
I didn't force you.

694
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
You came on your own.

695
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Then I'm here now.

696
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,240
Mr. Xiang, let's not sell the pavilion.

697
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,240
Mr. Zang, you must have come for him.

698
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,240
I've been looking for this three-fold.

699
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Fortunately, it's in the hands of Mr. Xiang.

700
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,240
I'm willing to pay double the price.

701
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Please.

702
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Double?

703
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Can you afford it?

704
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,240
I brought the house and land.

705
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
Please take it.

706
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,240
This three-fold is rare.

707
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,240
It's priceless to the real estate agent.

708
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Mr. Zang, I want to know what you want him to do.

709
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
To be honest,

710
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,240
I need to meet the officials when I first enter the official field.

711
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,240
I want to know more about the Prince Yongrong of the capital.

712
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,240
I heard he likes to collect ancient coins.

713
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
I want to steal his number.

714
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,240
It seems that Mr. Zang still cares about his own disciple.

715
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,240
This coin is really my new favorite.

716
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,240
After hearing you say it, I feel that it's more valuable.

717
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
I want to keep it myself.

718
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
Everything is here.

719
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Since Mr. Xiang doesn't want to,

720
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
I won't force you.

721
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Thank you for seeing me today.

722
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Goodbye.

723
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Stop.

724
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
I remember something.

725
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
I haven't finished reading the first page of the last time.

726
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Let me read it for you.

727
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
The wound healed so fast.

728
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,240
I can't see the scar from that day.

729
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
It's more official.

730
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
It looks deeper.

731
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,240
But the other part

732
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,240
is lighter than before.

733
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
It's lighter than before.

734
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,240
I don't dare to take the house that Pingjing Duke gave you.

735
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
I don't lack money.

736
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Take this coin.

737
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,240
But you owe me another favor.

738
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,240
Miss, you let him go so easily?

739
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,240
I can see that he has a lot of secrets in his heart.

740
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,240
But if we keep investigating, we won't find any result.

741
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,240
Let me see what he wants to do next.

742
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Green peach, small green grass.

743
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Green tears, no sound.

744
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
The dust is deep.

745
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:51,240
But I can't see through it.

746
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:04,240
The shadow is my life.

747
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,240
The eyes are my weapon.

748
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,240
The light is always on.

749
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,240
The hidden truth is not dark.

750
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:28,240
It's just that my heart is burning.

751
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:34,240
The cloud is me.

752
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,240
The cloud is me.

753
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,240
I'm so willful.

754
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,240
I'll be remembered by others.

755
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,240
The sound is me.

756
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,240
The rain is me.

757
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,240
When the sun sets,

758
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,240
I'll sing with the army.

759
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,240
The dream is me.

760
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,240
The hand is me.

761
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
The world is me.

762
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,240
The world is me.

763
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,240
You are me too.
