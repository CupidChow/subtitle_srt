1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We are the people of the world.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We are the people of the world.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We are the people of the world.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We are the people of the world.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We are the people of the world.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 13

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
His Majesty was furious at the palace today.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm afraid he already knew that the ghost-wrapped was here.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And the Eastern Prime Minister was also in the dark last night.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There was nothing so coincidental about it.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The imperial guards around the palace are not satisfied with the imperial guards.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It seems that His Majesty not only knows that the ghost-wrapped was here,

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but also suspects that it was on the head of the Eastern servants.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And Cao Jing Xian has already got the ghost-wrapped.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He is already dead.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Cao Jing Xian did not appear today.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He was injured badly.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He will not be in the dark for a short time.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The most important thing now is how to help the assassins to clear the suspicion.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If His Majesty's attitude is as you said,

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm afraid we can't even do anything about it.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
PrinceIGHT

23
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Your Highness, don't look anymore.

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Go back to your room.

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You are not recovered.

46
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I've lived here for ten years.

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I didn't like this place that much.

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But now

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't see how long

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want to see it.

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,840
You can't miss 3 more Chapters!

52
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I have already got the things.

53
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But I have no more.

54
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We spent so little.

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I didn't expect that the last one was you.

56
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think I will give it to you in the future.

57
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I will give it to you in the future.

58
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can leave now.

59
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What should we do now?

60
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The army has been in the palace for so many days.

61
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Have you seen the map? How is it?

62
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The news of the palace has been blocked.

63
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Now, we can't even ask him how he is.

64
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't worry.

65
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Everything is still in the discussion.

66
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But I am afraid that this situation won't last for long.

67
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Go back to my father and let him think of a way to help me.

68
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No.

69
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The palace is now in danger.

70
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There is no possibility of a private bed.

71
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Even if your father is willing to help us,

72
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
he will only make the situation more complicated and more difficult.

73
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
At that time, he can't help you.

74
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Even your family will be implicated.

75
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What should we do?

76
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't worry.

77
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I will do everything I can to make him out of danger.

78
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Minister.

79
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What's wrong?

80
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is the letter sent by the capital.

81
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The capital?

82
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It was sent by Eunuch Cao.

83
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes.

84
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It seems that these are all the letters sent by the capital.

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will go to the emperor.

86
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes.

87
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Minister.

88
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Minister.

89
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Something happened.

90
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What's wrong?

91
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I went to the capital and found that the building was surrounded by the imperial army.

92
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They said that the boss of the building is the capital.

93
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The boss of the building has been in the winter for ten years.

94
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He has been in the winter and the big deal.

95
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And he has a pair of imperial army.

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, no.

97
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What's wrong?

98
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The princess of the winter.

99
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What happened to the princess of the winter?

100
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Didn't you hear that?

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The princess of the winter is dead.

102
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I heard that she killed her.

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
She killed her own mother.

104
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's a good news.

105
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
She is out.

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It seems that...

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It seems that...

108
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Stop.

109
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What are you doing?

110
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Your highness.

111
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Your highness.

112
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I got the news.

113
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The new queen is coming.

114
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's Miss Xiang's sister.

115
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She is famous for her name.

116
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know what's wrong with her.

117
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The place is in the building.

118
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Miss Xiang's ten years of experience

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
has been in the winter and the big deal.

120
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
She has all the evidence.

121
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
She has all the evidence.

122
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
She said that Miss Xiang is not satisfied with her being a son.

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
She is still angry.

124
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
These are all wrong.

125
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Cao Jinxin knows that His Majesty wants to investigate the ghost.

126
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He is not satisfied with his son.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He is not satisfied with his son.

128
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Cao Jinxin knows that His Majesty wants to investigate the ghost.

129
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He made the decision in advance.

130
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And the new queen

131
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
has just been out of Miss Xiang's princess.

132
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
She is on the throne.

133
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
She is in great danger.

134
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Dong Xia won't interfere.

135
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That means

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
she is still angry with Dong Xia?

137
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You can say that.

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Cao Jinxin is seriously injured.

139
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
She has such a big ability.

140
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The queen is dead.

141
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
She has the first one to be out of the ghost.

142
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's me and An Tu.

143
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What should we do?

144
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Should we go to save Miss Xiang?

145
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't be so excited.

146
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If we have any action,

147
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
it's possible to kill her.

148
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Is there no way?

149
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Master,

150
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I need you to make a star-shaped armor.

151
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You want to go to the prison?

152
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No, no, no.

153
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Absolutely not.

154
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Xiaozi,

155
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
you are a special person.

156
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's very dangerous to do that.

157
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I have never reported to the public.

158
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I won't do anything wrong.

159
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Please help me this time.

160
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But the star-shaped armor

161
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
is not so easy to make.

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But my master will do it.

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't need to be very careful.

164
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I just need to protect the jade tribes.

165
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But you two can't get out of here.

166
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Xiaohai,

167
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
what are you going to do?

168
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The next thing I want to say is very important.

169
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No,

170
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
don't ask Yun Yong.

171
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Just do what I say.

172
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I want to make sure everything is safe.

173
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I will use this star-shaped armor

174
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
to build a peace-making map today.

175
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know about the situation there.

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So I have to see her as soon as possible.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What you have to do

178
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
is wait for me at home.

179
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No matter how late it is,

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
we have to find a way

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
to save her

182
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
when I come back.

183
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Time is running out.

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
She will be in trouble tomorrow.

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
We may have to wait for a few hours

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
to save her.

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Master,

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
believe me.

189
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We can definitely save An Tu.

190
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Go on.

191
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes.

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Zang.

193
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You have suffered.

194
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Why are you here?

195
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't do stupid things for me.

196
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't worry.

197
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I came here

198
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
to do the work.

199
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Did His Majesty ask you to take the case?

200
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No.

201
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is fake.

202
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Are you crazy?

203
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Wei Caowen and Shu Zui Tong are in the same army.

204
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They will find out the problem

205
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
as soon as they fight.

206
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You should leave the capital.

207
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't bother me.

208
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I have sold out this map.

209
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can't let you go.

210
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I will.

211
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
For Dong Xia,

212
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I am a useless person now.

213
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I am afraid I will die.

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I won't let you die.

215
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You will leave here safely.

216
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
His Majesty told me

217
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that he suspected that Dong Xia took away the ghost blood.

218
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
If he didn't find the ghost blood,

219
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
he wouldn't have taken it.

220
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If I leave,

221
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
he will only be angry with Dong Xia.

222
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
My sister went to the throne

223
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and followed the superior.

224
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Once the two armies are fighting,

225
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Dong Xia will be killed.

226
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Don't worry.

227
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I have a plan.

228
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I have a plan.

229
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't do anything for me.

230
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You can leave here as soon as you can.

231
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You should leave.

232
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I have lost too many relatives.

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Now,

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I can't lose you.

235
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Dong.

236
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Lord Song.

237
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Lord Zhang.

238
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's late.

239
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
His Majesty has been resting.

240
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Let's talk about it when we go to the court.

241
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Lord Song.

242
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I have something urgent.

243
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I must meet His Majesty right away.

244
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Please take it back.

245
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Master Gao.

246
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
This is the letter from Lord Zhang.

247
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
When is it?

248
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Lord Zhang gave it to me before he left.

249
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He specially ordered me to give it to you.

250
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What does it mean?

251
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Master.

252
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What I said to you is true and false.

253
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't know what you mean.

254
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't know what you mean.

255
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't know what you mean.

256
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't know what you mean.

257
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Even if it's true or false,

258
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I will do my best to save him.

259
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can only go by myself.

260
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I will confess everything to His Majesty.

261
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You know what it means.

262
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You are avoiding me tonight.

263
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If I fail,

264
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
please take Guan Feng and Shilei away from Gao Fei.

265
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
If I come back with him tomorrow,

266
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
we can still meet again.

267
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What did Xiao Ai say?

268
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Are you thinking about this marriage?

269
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We've been cheated.

270
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:06,100
May we just

271
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
He doesn't feel guilty at all.

272
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
He wants us to be out of our mind.

273
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,100
He also wants us to be without any worries and worries.

274
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
The Magistrate is here.

275
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Magistrate Dan, please.

276
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Your Majesty, Magistrate Zhang is here.

277
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

278
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Minister of Justice, Zang Hai.

279
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
What's your crime?

280
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
Tell me.

281
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
Tell me.

282
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
The thing that Your Majesty lost.

283
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Shut up!

284
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
Come on!

285
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
Tie him up for me.

286
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Yes.

287
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
Zang Hai.

288
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,100
You all leave.

289
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,100
Yes.

290
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
You can say it now.

291
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Zichen Zang Hai.

292
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,100
A few days ago, he entered His Majesty's hall

293
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
and opened His Majesty's gate in the warm room.

294
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
He took away Gui Xi.

295
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Zang Hai.

296
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
You're so bold.

297
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Where is Gui Xi?

298
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Your Majesty, Gui Xi was in the hands of Cao Jian Xian.

299
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,100
That night, Zui Sheng took Gui Xi back to Qing Zhen Sword

300
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
and was taken away by Cao Jian Xian.

301
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Was the Qi Army a crime?

302
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Your Majesty, the Qi Army is a crime.

303
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
It's even more a crime to take away Gui Xi.

304
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
I can tell you everything.

305
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
I can't believe it.

306
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
I'm going to deceive you.

307
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Why should I believe you?

308
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
There's another reason.

309
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,100
That day, I saw a tombstone in the hall

310
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,100
with the money and the record.

311
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,100
I found out that

312
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,100
my father and His Majesty had a relationship with His Majesty.

313
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,100
So I came today to tell you

314
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,100
that I'm afraid to have an old relationship with His Majesty.

315
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Father.

316
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Who are you?

317
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,100
My former name is Zhi Nu.

318
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
He was the son of the former emperor of Qing Tian Sword,

319
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
and ten years ago,

320
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
the Kui family lost their lives.

321
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,100
They were killed in the slaughter.

322
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
I escaped.

323
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Now I'm back to the capital

324
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
to avenge my father.

325
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
Your Majesty.

326
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
You're here to take a look?

327
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,100
What do you mean by Zhi Nu?

328
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
When I was a child,

329
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,100
my father set up a tombstone at home.

330
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
I asked him.

331
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
He said,

332
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
you'll never know

333
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,100
what the wild beast Kui is

334
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,100
and what it is.

335
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
But he told me

336
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,100
that he hoped you'd meet him in the most dangerous situation.

337
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
That's Li Rong.

338
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,100
I'm sorry.

339
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,100
Where is that road now?

340
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
It'll take some ages

341
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,100
to wear the crown at my house.

342
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,180
Pit Lord!

343
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,980
Your father earned what you deserve,

344
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,420
please rise!

345
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,420
Thanks, your majesty.

346
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,540
Sun Dongfang!

347
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,340
Your majesty.

348
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,580
Send some people to the C each of the correctional houses.

349
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,740
All of theoring of the others.

350
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,380
Y這個別人,

351
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,260
to search for me.

352
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

353
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,860
Who is your enemy?

354
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,340
Zhong Luyi,

355
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,180
Cao Jingxian.

356
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,380
And one more person.

357
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
I can't find out.

358
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,460
How about this?

359
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,500
After-syncfahrenzhen to Minnie

360
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,340
contagion遲 Today.

361
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,300
You� behaviour

362
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,860
You obtained

363
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,860
your team

364
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,460
To folder

365
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,100
defeated by the enemy of this company.

366
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,300
Your Majesty.

367
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,300
They killed my family because of Gui Xi.

368
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,300
So I had to find the third person through Gui Xi.

369
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,300
But you didn't find the enemy and you lost Gui Xi.

370
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,300
So they've been looking for Gui Xi for so many years.

371
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,300
Zhuang Lu Yi killed my family

372
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,300
and didn't want to return empty-handed.

373
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,300
He even broke my parents' skin and hanged it in the temple.

374
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,300
He also asked Chu Huai Ming to use his position to find the enemy.

375
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,300
And Cao Jin Xian used his position to find the enemy.

376
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,300
And Cao Jin Xian used his position to find the enemy.

377
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,300
And he arranged his son to be buried in the Sky Sword

378
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,300
until I took him out.

379
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,300
If they knew that Gui Xi was in your hands from the beginning

380
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,300
they might not know anything.

381
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,300
You blamed me for not telling the world about Gui Xi.

382
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:09,300
You made the whole family die and killed many people.

383
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
I don't dare.

384
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,300
Zhang Hai, you're too simple.

385
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,300
Even if I tell the world, they still won't give up.

386
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Are you willing to get rid of me?

387
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,300
Do you want to know what happened that year?

388
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,300
I'm the third enemy. I'm trying to find the enemy.

389
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,300
If you can tell me what happened that year

390
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,300
I might be able to find this person.

391
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,300
Do you know how to make a bird cage?

392
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,300
When I met your father, I was still a prince.

393
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,300
I like to be a magician.

394
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:52,300
The late emperor loved me and he especially liked to be my companion.

395
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,300
Your Highness.

396
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:06,300
The boat that Kuaido has sailed has become the best companion for me.

397
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,300
That's the most unforgettable time for me.

398
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
With Kuaido's company

399
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,300
I've also experienced the happiness of the ordinary people.

400
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,300
In the 20th and 20th years

401
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
In the 20th and 20th years

402
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,300
the war of Chu's position was finally settled.

403
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,300
The late emperor chose the crown prince.

404
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,300
He wasn't the prince's first son, Yan Wang.

405
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,300
He wasn't the king of the talents.

406
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,300
He was the mother of the prime minister.

407
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,300
At the time of the first edict

408
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,300
the emperor was called to the heaven and the earth.

409
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,300
He was appointed as the crown prince.

410
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
He was appointed for ten thousand years.

411
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,300
I can't study the art of wood now.

412
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,300
I'm taught by the crown prince's teacher.

413
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Kuaido went to the Qingtian Sword

414
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,300
to learn the art of wood with his father.

415
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:18,300
It's not a good day to be born in the emperor's family.

416
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
At that time I still didn't understand

417
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,300
what was waiting for me in front of me.

418
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,300
In the year of the 35th of the 5th of the 5th

419
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,300
the winter was a bit of a disaster.

420
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,300
The late emperor decided to fight the winter.

421
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
And I, as the crown prince

422
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,300
was left in the court to govern the state.

423
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,300
The army didn't come to the news.

424
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,300
The whole capital was in the happy mood.

425
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,300
But the palace was quietly looking at

426
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,300
a true hero.

427
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Your Highness.

428
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
Your Highness.

429
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
What's wrong with you?

430
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Someone, put on the doctor.

431
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,300
Put on the doctor.

432
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,300
Eunuch, it's bad.

433
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
The royal physician reported that

434
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
the empress was in a bad mood.

435
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
She called the doctor.

436
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
What?

437
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Your Highness.

438
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
You must hold on.

439
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,300
I'll go to the palace and get the doctor.

440
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Your Highness.

441
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:46,300
Go and find someone for me.

442
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Hurry up.

443
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Hurry up.

444
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Yes, Your Highness.

445
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Your Highness, hold on.

446
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,300
Your Highness.

447
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,300
I've been poisoned for a long time.

448
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,300
I've been here for a long time.

449
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,300
I'm afraid that

450
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,300
there will be more trouble for the enemy.

451
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
Eunuch Sun, inform the imperial army

452
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
to send more people.

453
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,300
But the imperial army is being transferred

454
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,300
to the mountain gate.

455
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
Eunuch Sun.

456
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Yes.

457
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Go to the camp and find Xuezhao.

458
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Let him bring someone to protect the family.

459
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Yes, Your Highness.

460
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,300
It's a good day to be at the emperor's house.

461
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
You're right.

462
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,300
They didn't poison me.

463
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,300
They'll bring someone to kill me.

464
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
I'm afraid that they'll be here tonight.

465
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
Go home.

466
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Go.

467
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,300
Don't stay here and die.

468
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Go.

469
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,300
Don't worry, Your Highness.

470
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,300
I won't let them hurt you again.

471
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,300
Your Highness.

472
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,300
The commander of the army.

473
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
The crown prince is in trouble.

474
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,300
Go to the front gate.

475
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
Yes.

476
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
Go.

477
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
Go.

478
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Go.

479
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
Go.

480
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
Go.

481
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Go.

482
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
Where is the crown prince?

483
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
Where is the crown prince?

484
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300
Who are you?

485
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
I'm the crown prince of Fengming.

486
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,300
I'm being summoned by His Majesty.

487
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
Your Highness.

488
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,300
His Majesty is in trouble.

489
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,300
The late emperor ordered to send the crown prince to the throne.

490
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,300
My father saved my life.

491
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,300
Your father is my most trusted man.

492
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,300
The army of the Great Yong is in a hurry.

493
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,300
The late emperor died because of the bad luck.

494
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,300
It's all because of the ghost.

495
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,300
The late emperor left me one last thing.

496
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,300
I'm sorry.

497
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,300
The late emperor left me one last thing.

498
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
I took the throne.

499
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,300
I was in the first place.

500
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,300
I was in a hurry.

501
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,300
So I wanted to make the private sword have its own people.

502
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,300
This person is Cao Jingxian.

503
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,300
And the second thing I want to do is to fight the emperor.

504
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,300
To learn the late emperor's name.

505
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,300
Although I defeated the late emperor with the ghost,

506
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,300
the queen of the east is still alive.

507
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,300
The ghost is not only the key.

508
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,300
I used the disguise of the guard.

509
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,300
The army of the Great Yong is in a hurry.

510
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,300
I fought the east again.

511
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,300
This time, the ghost of the east is not here.

512
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
It's finally my turn.

513
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,300
The third thing I want to do is to send your father

514
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,300
to the east of the mountain Dancui to build the fan stage.

515
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,300
To find the secret.

516
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,300
I know your father will never let me down.

517
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,300
And I have been waiting for three years.

518
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,300
The night of the ninth year of the holy year, your father is back.

519
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Your Majesty, the commander is back.

520
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,000
Calm down, your height and may be high and grab the壁 to theais for you.

521
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,300
Who is the emperor's인지?

522
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
You've said enough.

523
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,300
I know soon you'll find the emperor.

524
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,300
leads给我

525
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,520
It will be divided now.

526
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,860
This is a发then Lygo box.

527
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,240
Right.

528
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,140
Such a small thing

529
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,300
I have never seen it in person.

530
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,300
I only heard that it is powerful and powerful.

531
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,300
I was able to get this item.

532
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,300
Now, it is still in my hands.

533
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:26,300
I can't say whether it is useful or not.

534
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,300
How did you use this item?

535
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,300
Your Majesty, I don't know either.

536
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:53,300
Do you know what this item feels like in my hands?

537
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,300
I don't fear anyone.

538
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,300
The world is so important to me.

539
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Your Majesty, you are the son of Heaven.

540
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Even if it is not him,

541
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,300
everything in the world is yours.

542
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
You don't understand.

543
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
If this item is not here,

544
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
even after a few years,

545
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,300
the name of the son of Heaven will be gone.

546
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,300
I fear you will say this to others.

547
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Your Majesty.

548
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,300
I am just joking.

549
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Get up.

550
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,300
In the end,

551
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,300
you still don't want me to have this item?

552
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
I don't dare.

553
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,300
You are not aware of the tragic events many years ago.

554
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,300
If you use this item again to use the Star of the Great War,

555
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,300
you will regret it.

556
