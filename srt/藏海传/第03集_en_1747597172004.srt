00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,600
You have all the information?

5
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,640
Yes

6
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,600
When you arrive in the capital, someone will pick you up at the clinic

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,280
They want to find out your identity

8
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,440
It's not that easy

9
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,520
I will erase your traces here

10
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,440
Master

11
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,160
I have a question for you

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
OK

13
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,960
I found your trace when we were together

14
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
why didn't you ask me?

15
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
I

16
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,680
I had no choice

17
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,040
Because I know you must love me

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,520
You kiss me

00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
None of these matters.

22
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,920
You just need to remember,

23
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
from the night you got the old one,

24
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,080
we all exist because of you.

If you insist on knowing,

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,440
you can ask him

27
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
when you see Gao Ming next time.

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,520

Good.

52
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Come on.

53
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Everyone.

54
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
All the guests who have just arrived in the capital,

55
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
you must visit the building.

56
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
That's right.

57
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Here, besides eating, drinking, playing,

58
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
and having fun,

00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,920
the movie of the Eighth Prince of the Hall of the Moon,

60
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,920
you must watch it.

the secret of the capital,

63
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
you should have it here.

64
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Come on, guests.

65
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Please come in.

Please come in.

Young Master.

68
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Remember to watch the movie of the Eighth Prince.

69
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Please come in.

70
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Come on, guests.

71
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Please come in.

72
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Have fun.

73
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
You know it.

74
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Come on.

75
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Please come in.

76
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Please come in.

77
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Come on.

78
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
This way.

79
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
This way.

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
This way.

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
This way.

85
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Come on.

86
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Come on.

87
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
So beautiful.

88
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Come on.

89
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Come on.

90
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Be careful.

91
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
It's a boat.

92
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Get on it.

93
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Come on.

94
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
You can't be too serious.

95
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Don't go.

96
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Good.

97
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Good.

98
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Good.

99
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Good.

100
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Good.

101
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Good.

102
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
It's so beautiful.

103
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
So beautiful.

104
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
So beautiful.

105
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
So beautiful.

106
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
It fell again.

107
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
It's so wonderful.

108
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
So beautiful.

109
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
So beautiful.

110
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,480
Master, you...

111
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,100
쎄壺茶. Turn on the lights

112
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,520
Master, you want to light the lantern?

113
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,720
Yes, light the lantern

114
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,280
Sir, wait a second

115
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,860
You want to enter through the candlelight

116
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,500
or we eat with ginger

117
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Light the lamp.

118
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Wait a moment, young master.

119
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.

120
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Your lamp.

121
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Miss, why is this lamp

122
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
different from the lamps in other places?

123
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Sir, you don't know.

124
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I've been looking for you for a long time.

125
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
I don't know the rules here.

126
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
May I ask,

127
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
what is this lamp?

128
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
This place you're sitting in is called the pig's head.

129
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
It's the most prestigious and

130
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
most prosperous guest in our whole building.

131
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Whoever makes this pig's head and lights it

132
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
will be able to pay for tonight's Wangyue Pavilion.

133
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Not only will they reward the people on stage,

134
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
but also pay for the tea and wine

135
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
that the guests at the stage are watching.

136
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
This lamp is one thousand taels.

137
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
It's worth a thousand taels.

138
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
The last time you lit the lamp was Prince Yongrong.

139
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I won't light this lamp.

140
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I won't do this either.

141
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Goodbye.

142
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Wait.

143
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Since the pig's head is sitting on it,

144
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
it can't be left as it is.

145
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
The lamp is lit.

146
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
It can't be extinguished as it is.

147
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
To be honest,

148
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
I don't have that much money.

149
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
This is my whole family's money.

150
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Seven taels of silver.

151
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
I really can't afford to do this.

152
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
I'm sorry.

153
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I'm sorry.

154
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
This is for you.

156
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Thank you.

157
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Thank you.

158
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Wait.

160
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
I'll wait for you down there.

161
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I'll wait for you down there.

162
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Just wait.

163
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm sorry.

165
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I'm sorry.

166
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm sorry.

167
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,340
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,060
You just came to the capital?

169
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,540
Yes.

170
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,540
You need to collect money

171
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,460
to watch the show in our clinic.

172
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,300
You are standing here

173
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,580
with five taels of silver.

174
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,580
You just gave me seven taels.

175
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,860
Did I return the rest of the money to you

176
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
or did I tell you

177
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,980
about today's show?

178
00:14:51,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Even the guest

179
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Please note that this scene was narrationed with sound quality.

180
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,580
If either the director 접怨太久,

181
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:40,460
he would have scaled as a

182
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,180
extraterrestrial creature.

183
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,340
I just think he's just bratty,

184
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,340
The phoenix is gone first.

185
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,780
This phoenix is the Empress Dowager?

186
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,620
You're quite smart.

187
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,100
This phoenix

188
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,060
was the Empress Dowager who died eight days ago.

189
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,980
This dragon is the late emperor.

190
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,940
And the one next to it,

191
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,420
is the late emperor's favorite,

192
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,500
Concubine Li.

193
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,140
The late emperor has given the gift.

194
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,820
He doesn't care about the phoenix.

195
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,300
The Empress Dowager died.

196
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,180
According to the etiquette,

197
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,140
she should be buried with the late emperor.

198
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,700
But the late emperor

199
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,340
has Concubine Li to accompany him.

200
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,460
So he left such a difficult task to the emperor.

201
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,700
InCause of style

202
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,780
This gold dragon is the late emperor's favorite.

203
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,780
According to well smells of his downfall,

204
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,380
you pick this fry,

205
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,980
this eat it,

206
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,820
but I will not fear the dream last day.

207
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,580
I feel this is the golden dragon

208
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,860
after all the hard work of the Palace皆さん.

209
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,900
What about the King?

210
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,020
Over yet?

211
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,460
I find job applications peoples

212
00:16:51,180 --> 00:17:07,740
People who do not believe in their great These are the Golden long

213
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,060
After Empress Dowager died, they were even more

214
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,020
in the family.

215
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,380
It's either the last words of the emperor

216
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,700
or the death of the nobility.

217
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,220
They asked the emperor to follow the etiquette

218
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,300
and take the Imperial Concubine Li out of the imperial mausoleum.

219
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,140
Now the court is divided into two parties.

220
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,460
One party is led by Prince Linzi.

221
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,220
They asked to honor Empress Dowager's order.

222
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,740
But the other party didn't obey.

223
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,300
Then the bear chicken that was killed by the Chanchu people

224
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,980
is Prince Linzi.

225
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,140
Prince Linzi is Empress Dowager's son.

226
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,900
The matter of Empress Dowager's funeral

227
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,660
is that he was the last one to go to the court.

228
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,620
He even wanted to go back to the capital

229
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,900
to mourn for Empress Dowager.

230
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,380
The new building is over.

231
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,900
The cloud is in the sky.

232
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,700
There is no shadow here.

233
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,460
What did the emperor say?

234
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,100
Didn't you see that dragon flying away?

235
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,700
The emperor doesn't care about this.

236
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,820
So great.

237
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,700
The white fox who took the fate and examining the UN.

238
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,140
The whole society is rose.

239
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,460
Talking, I could only die married for you two.

240
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,900
This white fox

241
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,660
must be the main character today.

242
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,780
Fight the danger and the suit.

243
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,460
Yes.

244
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,860
This white tiger is Cheng Jinhu.

245
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,820
He was Mr. the burgeoning prince at that time.

246
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,660
I'm sorry

247
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,780
The one who was ordered by the emperor to deal with the funeral of the Empress Dowager

248
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,380
was Gong Bu and Qin Tianjian

249
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,620
But the son of the Minister of Works, Zhuang Zhifu, is Pingjing Duke

250
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,100
For Zhuang Zhifu

251
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,740
Pingjing Duke had to suffer a head injury

252
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,700
Where are you going?

253
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,860
The play hasn't started yet

254
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,100
I'm afraid something big is going to happen here today

255
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,500
Miss, you should go now

256
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,140
What's wrong?

257
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,180
What did you see?

258
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,180
Come on

259
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,740
Come on

260
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,220
Come on

261
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,700
Come on

262
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,260
Come on

263
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,860
Come on

264
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,540
Come on

265
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,140
Come on

266
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,740
Come on

267
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,380
Come on

268
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,980
Come on

269
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,580
Come on

270
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,140
Come on

271
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,740
Come on

272
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,420
Come on

273
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,140
Come on

274
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,220
Did you see the young master on my right?

275
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,340
There's a steel knife in the fan in his hand

276
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,980
The one on my left

277
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,820
who has been writing things

278
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,580
I'm afraid he's writing the evidence

279
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,420
I...

280
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,260
Don't point

281
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,060
Look at his body, he's so full of weapons

282
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,700
There must be a weapon on his body

283
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,540
There are also many people with a sharp eye on the second floor

284
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,980
I'm afraid they're here to catch the young master

285
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,420
They...

286
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,420
They...

287
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,220
They're the guards of the Commandant's Office

288
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,260
Eunuch Cao's people

289
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,980
Eunuch Cao?

290
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,100
Eunuch Cao is the eunuch in charge of the Bureau

291
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,420
He's the leader of the Commandant's Office

292
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,300
He's the leader of eunuchs all over the world

293
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,740
He's been to the government office

294
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,340
and the inn

295
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,980
His guards are everywhere in the capital

296
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,460
Bravo!

297
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,740
How dare you say that in front of the Imperial Guards?

298
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,820
When you came here

299
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,980
did you see the plaque on the hall?

300
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
It's a gift from His Majesty

301
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,780
That's the imperial plaque His Majesty gave him

302
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,220
He's in the hall

303
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,180
It's like His Majesty's edict

304
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,540
Although there are Imperial Guards watching here all the time

305
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,060
they've never done it

306
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,380
Maybe they didn't dare to do it before

307
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,140
But not today

308
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,620
What do you mean?

309
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,060
Although Young Master Yinsi is known as the powerful

310
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,740
he offended many people

311
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,460
And he's talking about His Majesty today

312
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,420
He's been talking about the secret of the palace

313
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,020
And Eunuch Cao is also a good friend of His Majesty

314
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,820
The guards can show up

315
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,620
Even if there's a plaque on the hall

316
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,780
I'm afraid they'll come to kill us

317
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,300
According to what you said

318
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,980
I'm afraid Young Master Yinsi is very dangerous today

319
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,980
Miss

320
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,860
If you know Young Master Yinsi

321
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,460
you should remind him to leave

322
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,100
Now there are guards everywhere

323
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,300
With their tricks

324
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,580
Young Master Yinsi must be in a big trouble

325
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,940
You're so smart

326
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,180
You should help him

327
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,900
Me?

328
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,580
What can I do?

329
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,940
I can't help him now

330
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,780
Who said that?

331
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,460
You can do him a favor

332
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:49,940
I...

333
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,180
So you're Young Master Yinsi

334
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,380
I've been waiting for you

335
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,260
Yes

336
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,100
Miss, what do you mean?

337
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,140
I've never seen you before

338
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,180
turns out you're handsome

339
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,500
Today you are not on the stage

340
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
and you'll be our show shit

341
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,980
ItFitting

342
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,940
Young Master, Young Master

343
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,980
How come?

344
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,620
Young Master

345
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,980
Whice think that it doesn't matter

346
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,460
What are you trying to do?

347
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,580
No one's seen you before

348
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,540
Now you're Young Master

349
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,540
Get lost

350
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,500
I

351
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,820
Could you write a book?

352
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,180
Yeah

353
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,820
Young Master

354
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,820
Young Master!

355
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
Young Master!

356
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
Young Master!

357
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,820
Young Master!

358
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
Where are you going?

359
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,820
What are you doing?

360
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,820
Don't go!

361
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
What are you doing?

362
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Why did you run away?

363
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,820
I'm going to teach you a lesson!

364
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,820
Young Master!

365
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,820
Young Master!

366
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
There!

367
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
Chase!

368
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
Stop!

369
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,820
Hurry!

370
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
Chase!

371
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
Let's go!

372
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
Idiot!

373
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,820
There!

374
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,820
Where is he?

375
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
Over there!

376
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,820
Come here!

377
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
Don't move!

378
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,820
Do as I said!

379
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Young Master!

380
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
You're drunk!

381
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
Let's go!

382
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,820
Why can't you drink?

383
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,820
You're drunk after drinking so little!

384
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,820
Young Master!

385
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,820
Why can't you drink?

386
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
No, no, no!

387
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Mr. Ding Yuanbo is in the building.

388
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
He's even making a mess for you!

389
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
Let's go!

390
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
Let's go!

391
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Let's go!

392
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Let's go!

393
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
Let's go!

394
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
How is it?

395
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,820
I lost it. I didn't find it.

396
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
Really?

397
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
Let's go!

398
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,820
Let's go!

399
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Let's go!

400
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
Mr. Wang!

401
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Slow down!

402
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
Master!

403
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,820
I didn't expect you to pick me up!

404
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
You came to the capital.

405
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,820
Of course, I have to come here in advance.

406
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,820
If I wasn't here,

407
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,820
I'm afraid your life would be over here.

408
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,820
I'm really careless today.

409
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,820
I didn't expect to be picked up by someone.

410
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,820
Who is the girl who teased you?

411
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,820
I don't know.

412
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,820
I only know that she's working for the clinic.

413
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,820
Master,

414
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,820
are those meetings very difficult?

415
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,820
It's okay.

416
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,820
I'm a bunch of guys who listen to orders.

417
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
I guess they'll react this time.

418
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,820
You're not the one they want to catch.

419
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,820
Boy,

420
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,820
you must be very tired

421
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,820
seeing the tiger and the dragon in the capital today.

422
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,820
You're right.

423
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,820
I should be more careful.

424
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,820
But I've also learned something.

425
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820
At least I know what Pingjing Duke is doing.

426
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,820
Tell me.

427
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
The Empress Dowager has buried her.

428
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,820
The courtiers are divided into two parties.

429
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
One party is the host and the other party is the present.

430
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,820
The late emperor and the imperial concubine Li Gui are buried together.

431
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,820
The other party is the host and the imperial concubine Li Gui is buried together.

432
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
The emperor is the south.

433
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,820
So he handed the hot mountain to Pingjing Duke's son

434
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,820
and announced the house of the deputy minister.

435
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,820
Now there are only three days left.

436
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,820
So Pingjing Duke ordered to stop it.

437
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,820
Now he's looking for Feng Shui in the whole capital.

438
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Let me ask you.

439
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
Who is the Empress Dowager?

440
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,820
The late emperor's empress and the emperor's legitimate mother.

441
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,820
Who is the imperial concubine Li Gui?

442
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,820
The late emperor's mother.

443
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,820
The late emperor's beloved concubine.

444
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,820
Then who do you think is the one?

445
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
The emperor.

446
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,820
So it seems that the one who saved the court is Li.

447
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,820
But in fact, it's the one who is the emperor and the court.

448
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,820
The official position of the imperial concubine Li Gui is not good enough.

449
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,820
The official position of the imperial concubine Li Gui is not good enough.

450
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,820
The official position of the imperial concubine Li Gui is not good enough.

451
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,820
It's wrong no matter what you do.

452
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:04,820
So do you still think that this matter can be solved by finding a Feng Shui?

453
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Then Pingjing Duke should know this too.

454
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Why does he still do this?

455
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,820
This kind of thing is for others to see.

456
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
Take him away.

457
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,820
Let me go.

458
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,820
You caught the wrong person at midnight.

459
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
I don't know how to watch Feng Shui.

460
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
I'm a broken coffin.

461
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
Let me go.

462
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,820
The car was hit by Feng Shui.

463
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Everyone who stood next to Sang Sang was caught.

464
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,820
Two days ago, even the seller of incense sticks was caught.

465
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Pingjing Duke is expressing his feelings to the court.

466
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,820
He tried his best.

467
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Master, let me do it.

468
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,820
Master, do you think I'm like Feng Shui?

469
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,820
Why did you think of entering the palace?

470
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
Son, I...

471
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
Father.

472
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,820
Dad.

473
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Close your eyes.

474
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
Father.

475
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,820
Go.

476
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,820
Father.

477
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
Son.

478
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
Father.

479
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,820
Sir.

480
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Sir.

481
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
I beg you, sir.

482
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,820
I won't watch Feng Shui.

483
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,820
I won't.

484
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
I'm just a paper money seller.

485
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
I only know how to make paper money.

486
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,820
I really don't know how to watch Feng Shui.

487
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
Father.

488
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Father.

489
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,820
Really?

490
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,820
I won't lie to you, sir.

491
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,820
Father.

492
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,820
Son.

493
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,820
Son.

494
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
Father.

495
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,820
Son.

496
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,820
Son.

497
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,820
Father.

498
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,820
He's back now.

499
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
He's back.

500
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
Please.

501
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
Father.

502
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
Father.

503
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,820
I beg you.

504
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,820
I beg you not to kill my son.

505
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
Take him away.

506
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,820
Sir.

507
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,820
Father.

508
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
Son.

509
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,820
Father.

510
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,820
Sir, one more person is missing.

511
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
Wait.

512
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Father.

513
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,820
Since you know how to do it,

514
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
your son should know how to do it too.

515
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,820
Let him help you.

516
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Sir.

517
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,820
You promised not to kill him just now.

518
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
He's just a child.

519
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,820
I beg you to let him go.

520
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,820
I won't kill him.

521
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
But I didn't promise not to take him away.

522
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,820
Take him away.

523
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,820
Son.

524
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
Son.

525
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,820
Son.

526
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
Sir, please wait.

527
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,820
I heard that you were looking for Mr. Feng Shui.

528
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
I'm not talented.

529
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,820
I know Feng Shui a little bit.

530
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
I'm willing to go.

531
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,820
I wonder if you can forget this child.

532
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,820
You're interesting.

533
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
You're really a troublemaker.

534
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
You came to me.

535
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
Let's go together.

536
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
Go.

537
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
Sir, please wait.

538
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Feng Shui is a very delicate child.

539
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,820
Children are very clumsy.

540
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,820
If it's a big thing that has delayed the official business,

541
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,820
it's not good.

542
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
Let's go.

543
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,820
General.

544
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
Father is fine.

545
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
Father is fine.

546
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,820
I'm a killer.

547
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
I killed a pig for the Taoist priest.

548
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,820
How can I see the dog's ass Feng Shui?

549
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,820
I'm a Qin Monkey.

550
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,820
I can't even tolerate pigs.

551
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,820
I just hope that

552
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,820
I can use my life

553
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,820
to call my son safe and sound.

554
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
I'll bury him in the tribe.

555
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Sir.

556
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
Sir.

557
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Thank you for saving my son.

558
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,820
You get up first.

559
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,820
You get up first.

560
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,820
Get up first.

561
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,820
I can't repay you for your kindness.

562
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,820
I'm afraid I can't repay you in this life.

563
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,820
In the next life,

564
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,820
I'll be a cow and a horse

565
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,820
to repay you.

566
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,820
It's okay to be a cow and a horse.

567
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,820
Maybe we can go back alive.

568
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,820
Aren't you a son?

569
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,820
You can't even avoid it.

570
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,820
You're still in the hurry to...

571
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,820
Do you have such a trick or a fake trick?

572
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,820
Everyone.

573
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,820
We're going to see Pingjing Monkey,

574
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,820
not Lord Yan.

575
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,820
You ask Ye Si.

576
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Can you solve this?

577
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,820
I'll die every day.

578
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,820
I'm sleepy.

579
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,820
I'll sleep for a while.

580
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,820
Please wake me up when you arrive.

581
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,820
Thank you.

582
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
Okay.

583
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,820
I'm going to die of illness.

584
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
And that temperament of sleeping.

585
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,820
Dramatized.

586
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
Go.

587
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,820
I'm going to die.

588
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,820
What's wrong?

589
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
Get off.

590
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,820
Get off quickly.

591
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,820
Get off quickly.

592
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Hurry.

593
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,820
Hurry up.

594
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,820
Hurry up.

595
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
Brat.

596
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
What are you looking at?

597
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,820
What are you looking at?

598
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
Go.

599
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,820
Go.

600
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,820
Go.

601
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,820
Go.

602
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,820
Hurry up.

603
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,820
Let's go.

604
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,320
Go.

605
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,540
Hurry up!

606
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,300
Get in!

607
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,740
Get in!

608
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,780
Close the door!

609
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,460
Open the door!

610
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:55,900
Open the door!

611
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,740
Open it!

612
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,580
Open it!

613
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,380
Open the door!

614
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,380
Get out!

615
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,180
Let me out!

616
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Master!

617
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,380
Let me out!

618
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:04,980
Let us out!

619
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
Yah beasts

620
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,120
Yang

621
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,100
scared the gris

622
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,980
The two garbage

623
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,300
ушка

624
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:13,400
Although

625
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Don't move!

626
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Where is this place?

627
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
We have no choice.

628
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
We can only move forward.

629
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
But this underground palace is very dangerous.

630
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
You must follow my instructions.

631
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Don't touch anything.

632
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Do you hear me?

633
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
This is the Ghost Valley.

634
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
This is the Ghost Valley.

635
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
This is the Ghost Valley.

636
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
The north is south.

637
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
The five stars are not separated.

638
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:54,560
The water is

639
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
There is the west.

640
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,400
You mean you have a way to take us out?

641
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
I can only try.

642
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
I will count to three.

643
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Everyone follows my instructions.

644
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
We move together.

645
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Liu, come.

646
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,400
You step on the second ring of the west side from here.

647
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Tu Fu, you step on the third ring of the west side from here.

648
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Do you hear me?

649
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,400
One, two, three.

650
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
The mechanism of the tomb is connected.

651
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
As long as you walk in the right place, nothing will happen.

652
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Brother, you step back.

653
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
You step on the first brick on the east side.

654
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Brother, you step on the first brick on the west side.

655
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Are you sure it's this one?

656
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Trust me.

657
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
I'm ready.

658
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,400
One, two, three.

659
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,400
The wood is dark and the man is clear.

660
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,400
The grass is green and the river is deep.

661
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
You haven't been a soldier for a long time.

662
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
But you are still smart and smart.

663
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
You have a good sense of style.

664
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
You are as good as before.

665
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Since you can't speak, cut your tongue.

666
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Please spare my life.

667
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
My lord.

668
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
My lord, they are all in the tomb.

669
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,400
My lord, the new batch of Feng Shui has arrived.

670
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
What about the previous batch?

671
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
They have been handled according to the order of the marquis.

672
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
There are more than eighty people.

673
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,400
None of them can think of a solution.

674
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,400
The real Feng Shui is a man of great wisdom.

675
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,400
I have sent more people to search for the Ming Shan Bridge.

676
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
I will definitely solve the problem for you.

677
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Lord Chu, I'm waiting for you to solve the problem.

678
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,400
I'm afraid this fire will burn down my marquis's mansion.

679
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
My lord, please calm down.

680
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
I will definitely solve it.

681
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Change the bow.

682
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
My lord.

683
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Father.

684
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
I have a question.

685
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,400
The Empress Dowager's funeral is a dispute between the emperor and the courtiers.

686
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Why do you have to find Mr. Feng Shui?

687
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,400
The Empress Dowager's funeral has its own opinions.

688
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
But apart from the emperor,

689
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
the opinions of others are not important.

690
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
It's hard to say.

691
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
The emperor's mind is easy to guess.

692
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,400
But if you want to think of a good solution,

693
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
it's hard.

694
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,400
What if I can't find it?

695
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
I will find a solution.

696
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,400
First, you have to make the surface work.

697
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Don't let people find out.

698
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,400
I will protect you no matter what.

699
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,400
I understand. Thank you, father.

700
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Kunyun He De, Ji Jian Tong.

701
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
The weapon is the edge.

702
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
It will be the chest.

703
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
The emperor's mind is easy to guess.

704
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
But apart from the emperor,

705
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
the people are not important.

706
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
The people are important.

707
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
I think I got it wrong.

708
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
I think I got it wrong.

709
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Fall down!

710
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
What are you doing?

711
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Don't move!

712
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
This is the broken bone knife.

713
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
It's the secret mechanism of the previous dynasty.

714
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
I didn't expect to see it here.

715
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
It's the secret mechanism of the previous dynasty.

716
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
I didn't expect to see it here.

717
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
How can it be?

718
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
This kind of silk is as hard as mud.

719
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
But it's also rare.

720
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
The people who buried it

721
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
will not use it without end.

722
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
It must be set according to some rules.

723
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Tu Fu,

724
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
the fourth brick of the west side of Ni Cai.

725
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Fan Liao,

726
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,400
the fourth brick of the south side of Ni Cai.

727
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Okay.

728
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Let's make the broken bone knife

729
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
and the broken sword

730
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
closer to the edge of the broken bone.

731
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Listen to me.

732
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
One,

733
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
two,

734
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
three.

735
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Cooperate with the liver and know the details.

736
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
You will definitely be blessed with a good fortune.

737
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
You will definitely be blessed with a good fortune.

738
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
To open the dragon's shell with the mortal world,

739
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
you need to understand the order of the world.

740
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
To open the dragon's shell with the mortal world,

741
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
you need to understand the order of the world.

742
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
One, two,

743
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
three.

744
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Four.

745
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Five.

746
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Six.

747
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Seven.

748
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Eight.

749
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
Nine.

750
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Ten.

751
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
Ten.

752
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Twenty.

753
00:41:46,400 --> 00:42:01,200
The brick under your feet will be

754
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
This is the old behavior.

755
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Next, we need to re-examine the Chinese Communist Party.

756
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
The Chinese Communist Party

757
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Tu Fu,

758
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
the second brick of the west side of Ni Cai.

759
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
