1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm just going to try to get the key to the other side of the map.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to try to get the key to the other side of the map.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to try to get the key to the other side of the map.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to try to get the key to the other side of the map.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to try to get the key to the other side of the map.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm going to try to get the key to the other side of the map.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,080
Rep delivered

9
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,260
New Moments

10
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:30,060
ác

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,200
Merciful

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,760
Lord

13
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,540
Your smile is是什麼

14
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,540
A man with a soft heart can never be a man.

15
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,540
But, Kuei Qing, you know a lot about my soft heart.

16
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Kuei Tu, you helped me a great king.

17
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,540
I will never be able to treat you badly.

18
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,540
You are so wronged by your talent and martial arts.

19
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,540
Think about it.

20
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,540
How can you enter the Inner Pavilion?

21
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,540
You can do your best to help me.

22
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,540
Your Majesty, I have a favor to ask you.

23
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540
Yes.

24
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,540
I have been in the forest for a long time.

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,540
I have lost my temper.

26
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,540
Now, I have been in the cold for three years.

27
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,540
I have lost my temper.

28
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,540
I am afraid I will never be able to serve you again.

29
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,540
I want to leave the capital for good.

30
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,540
You want to leave?

31
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,540
I want to take my son to the old house of Zhenning.

32
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,540
I will stay there and settle down.

33
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
Zhenning is not far from the capital.

34
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,540
If you miss me again, you can call me anytime.

35
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,540
Have you been the same since you came back from the north?

36
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,540
No.

37
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,540
Does anyone know that you have been in the palace?

38
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,540
I have been in the secret passage.

39
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
Where is your family?

40
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
I haven't been back yet.

41
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,540
What's the matter?

42
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
Kuaiduo,

43
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,540
you didn't lie to me, did you?

44
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,540
I dare not.

45
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,540
Okay.

46
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,540
I will fulfill your wish.

47
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Leave with your family.

48
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

49
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,540
I will take my leave.

50
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

51
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,540
His Majesty told theMP researchers

52
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
I have to report to the bandits.

53
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,540
How much?

54
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,540
The whole family is in a coma.

55
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,540
All the people in the family are burnt to death.

56
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Your Majesty, do you want me to send someone to check on you?

57
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,540
Yes.

58
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,540
I didn't expect this to end.

59
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,540
I didn't protect my most loyal servant.

60
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,540
Tell me, what did you see that night?

61
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,540
Your Majesty, do you really want to hear it?

62
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
Tell me.

63
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,540
They used my brother's life to force me to return to the west.

64
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,540
Not only did they not say that after they killed my brother,

65
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,540
they used my sister, the servant's life, to continue to threaten me.

66
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:45,540
And they still didn't say that my sister and mother were killed.

67
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,540
They were killed by me.

68
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,540
I only understand that what my father did was for the sake of my life.

69
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,540
I only understand that my sister and mother were killed.

70
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,540
Tell me, what did you see that night?

71
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,540
The whole family is in a coma.

72
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,540
I didn't see my sister and mother.

73
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,540
I only understand that my sister and mother were killed.

74
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,540
I only understand that my sister and mother were killed.

75
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,540
Your Majesty.

76
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Your Majesty.

77
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
Your Majesty.

78
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,540
Your Majesty.

79
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Your Majesty.

80
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Your Majesty, Cao Jingxian is dead.

81
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,540
Your Majesty, we have found out that he is seriously injured.

82
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,540
I have also calculated that he is dead for at least five days.

83
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
But the position of the man in the manor is not long.

84
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Some of them are still not recovered.

85
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,540
How did he die?

86
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,540
He died due to poisoning.

87
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
There is no one in the manor.

88
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,540
We have found out that he is still not recovered.

89
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,540
I will take him to the manor.

90
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
You may leave.

91
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,540
You may leave.

92
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
The capital guards report every day.

93
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,540
They have never stopped for a few days.

94
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,540
Your Majesty.

95
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Someone has found out Cao Jingxian's secret.

96
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
He was in the sea after he died.

97
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,540
Not only did he not get any relief from the capital guards,

98
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
but also let no one in the manor survive.

99
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,540
He is so concerned about it.

100
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,540
I am afraid that the third enemy of mine has appeared.

101
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,540
If Cao Jingxian is seriously injured,

102
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,540
I will know that.

103
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,540
It will be difficult for me to move them.

104
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,540
I want to do this.

105
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,540
There is only one way.

106
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,540
Cao Jingxian has hidden his death.

107
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,540
He has to let his family live in his own place.

108
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,540
He has to use his command to move the capital guards.

109
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,540
What do you mean?

110
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,540
Gui Xi must have fallen into his hands.

111
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
You came here today

112
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,540
because you wanted to find the third enemy.

113
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,540
You can't find him without my help.

114
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,540
I have told you the truth you wanted.

115
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,540
Now you need to help me find Gui Xi.

116
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,540
Yes, you need to help me find Gui Xi.

117
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,540
I will do my best to save my life.

118
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,540
But I still have one thing to ask you.

119
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,540
Yes.

120
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,540
If you don't help me and my son,

121
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,540
I am afraid that I will die soon.

122
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,540
The queen of the east is dying for her son.

123
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,540
And she is not a murderer.

124
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,540
I beg your majesty to let her go.

125
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,540
Okay.

126
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,540
I will do as you say.

127
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,540
I will let her go.

128
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,540
I thank your majesty.

129
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
This is a sword from Duan Ning.

130
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,540
It is like a forest.

131
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
I will give it to you.

132
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
And find out the truth.

133
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,540
You need to hurry.

134
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,540
Otherwise, we will have a bloody battle.

135
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
Go.

136
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,540
Go.

137
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
I will take you home.

138
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,540
Go.

139
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
Your majesty.

140
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Your majesty.

141
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,540
Your majesty.

142
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
My son.

143
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
We have been waiting for you.

144
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
I just said that you will come.

145
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
Master.

146
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
Miss.

147
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,540
You are suffering inside.

148
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,540
They didn't do anything to you, right?

149
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,540
I am fine.

150
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
Thank you, master.

151
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
Don't be so sad.

152
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,540
Let's go.

153
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,540
You and Miss Xiang, get in the car.

154
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,540
Master.

155
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,540
I...

156
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
What are you waiting for?

157
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
You are not enough?

158
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,540
Master, I...

159
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
Go home.

160
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Go.

161
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,540
Go.

162
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Go home.

163
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
Come.

164
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
Come.

165
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,540
The building is closed.

166
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,540
I am going to find the right person to take over.

167
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,540
The people who worked in the building

168
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,540
are the firemen and the maidens who are so skilled.

169
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,540
We will find a way to keep them.

170
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
It must be hard to do that.

171
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
You are in trouble.

172
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,540
It's good that they can stay.

173
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
Don't worry.

174
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
An Tu.

175
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
You can live here.

176
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,540
I will make people feel sad.

177
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,540
This is your room.

178
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
Isn't it your bedroom?

179
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,540
Where will you live?

180
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,540
If there is no place for us to live,

181
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,540
don't worry.

182
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,540
You are tired from taking long.

183
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,540
I have prepared hot water and clothes.

184
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,540
You should rest.

185
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,540
Don't go.

186
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
I don't want to live alone.

187
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
Okay.

188
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,540
I will stay with you.

189
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,540
You idiot.

190
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,540
You don't care about anything

191
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
in order to save me?

192
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Didn't I tell you?

193
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,540
I will never lose you.

194
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,540
From now on,

195
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,540
you are my family.

196
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
After I am in prison,

197
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,540
what action will you take?

198
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,540
She is dead.

199
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,540
You killed her?

200
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,540
When His Majesty sent people to find her,

201
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,540
she was already dead.

202
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,540
It's a pity that I can't kill her personally

203
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,540
and avenge my mother.

204
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,540
It's all over.

205
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,540
His Majesty has appointed me as a concubine.

206
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I don't admit my princess anymore.

207
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
From now on,

208
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,540
I will not do anything.

209
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,540
Look.

210
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
I am a poor girl.

211
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,540
You are a woman now.

212
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,540
Then we will never see each other again.

213
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,540
Mr. Zhang's reputation

214
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,540
is always so good.

215
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
Before Miss Xiang,

216
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
I was so stupid.

217
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,540
An Tu.

218
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,540
Your Highness.

219
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Your Highness.

220
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,540
It's great that you are finally back.

221
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,540
All right, all right.

222
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
I am fine.

223
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
It's all over.

224
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
Why are you standing here?

225
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
I am afraid that you can't come alone.

226
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,540
I want to give you a hand.

227
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,540
You are standing here?

228
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,540
I...

229
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,540
What kind of dish did you prepare today?

230
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,540
Tell me.

231
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,540
You will know when I get up.

232
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
I have never seen you cook.

233
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
I will eat more.

234
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,540
You are too old to cook.

235
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
You are wrong.

236
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,540
It's me.

237
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,540
It's me who is wrong.

238
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
You are right.

239
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
You are wrong.

240
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
I am wrong

241
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,540
and I am not.

242
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,540
I am the one who is wrong.

243
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
You are right.

244
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
I will help you.

245
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
I will help you.

246
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
You didn't tell me that I was right.

247
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
I will help you.

248
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
No, master.

249
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,540
It's wrong.

250
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
You told me that

251
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,540
the most important thing in revenge is to live.

252
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,540
You are doing this to save Miss Xiang.

253
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,540
I believe that you are a brother with a brotherhood.

254
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
You have the right to do so.

255
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,540
But people are not as good as the heavens.

256
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,540
No matter how many times I plan to kill you,

257
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
I am afraid that I will lose.

258
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,540
I can't let you be so dangerous.

259
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,540
Well,

260
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,540
let's see.

261
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
Let me ask you.

262
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
How can I do it?

263
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
You said that

264
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,540
the one who is on the top of the head is the sky.

265
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,540
The one who goes down the mountain is the one who goes down the mountain.

266
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
You still remember that?

267
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
The sky is dark.

268
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
The old man is on the top of the head.

269
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,540
There is no one on the top of the head in this world.

270
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
Master is right.

271
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
Master.

272
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
Ten years ago,

273
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,540
I was taken care of by you and Master Xindo

274
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
and passed on to you.

275
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
Then I can grow up to this day.

276
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
In my heart,

277
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,540
you have already been my step-son.

278
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,540
As a son,

279
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,540
I hope that my step-son will be safe and sound.

280
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,540
So if there is another time,

281
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,540
I will die.

282
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
I will still do it.

283
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,540
As a parent,

284
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,540
I would rather die for my own child

285
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,540
than live for myself.

286
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,540
You have to live for your revenge.

287
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,540
You have to live for your life.

288
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
You have done it.

289
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,540
You can come back to me and admit your mistake.

290
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,540
If you have lost your life,

291
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,540
I will have no disciple.

292
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
I am old.

293
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,540
Only you have a disciple.

294
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
If you have no one,

295
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,540
who will be my grandchild?

296
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,540
Master, I will be better.

297
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
You must live well.

298
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
Smile at me.

299
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
Tell me.

300
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
What is your son's play?

301
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,540
He has been fooled by His Majesty.

302
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
Actually,

303
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
I just told His Majesty

304
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,540
the truth.

305
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,540
If there is a liar in the world,

306
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,540
I am afraid that the leader

307
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,540
will have to be you.

308
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
Tell me.

309
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,540
How did you cheat?

310
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,540
Master,

311
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
you should go and get some medicine.

312
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,540
Stop.

313
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,540
Stop playing with me.

314
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
Don't make me suffer.

315
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
I will be your master.

316
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,540
I will be your master.

317
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
Stop playing with me.

318
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
Don't make me suffer.

319
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Do you know

320
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
what I regret the most

321
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,540
when I beat your leader?

322
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540
It's not that I feel sorry for you.

323
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
I don't know

324
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,540
how to make you suffer.

325
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
You are lying again.

326
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,540
My master's face is not so thin.

327
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,540
You are obviously feeling sorry for me.

328
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,540
You are looking for a fight again?

329
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
Tell me.

330
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
I will tell you.

331
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,540
I really don't feel sorry for you.

332
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
I am actually...

333
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,540
Master.

334
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
It's hot.

335
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
It's hot.

336
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
Slowly.

337
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
It's hot.

338
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
Come on, Cai Qi.

339
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
Cai Qi.

340
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
These dishes

341
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,540
are all made by Master Gao Ming.

342
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,540
Really?

343
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,540
Miss Feng Liu,

344
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
how did they leave?

345
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
They went back to the office

346
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,540
to pack up their things.

347
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
So,

348
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,540
they are moving here to live?

349
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
You are stupid.

350
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,540
Miss Xiang moved here.

351
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
They both moved here.

352
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Where do they live?

353
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Do you understand?

354
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Why are you beating me?

355
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
I am telling you,

356
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,540
you are a liar.

357
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,540
I heard that

358
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
today's dishes

359
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,540
were made by Master Gao Ming.

360
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
Master Zang beat them.

361
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,540
Master Gao Ming,

362
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
tell us.

363
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
What is the truth

364
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,540
about these dishes?

365
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,540
I will introduce them to you.

366
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,540
These are

367
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,540
dried pork liver and fried pork belly.

368
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,540
They are dry and not smelly.

369
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,540
But they are not fishy or fishy.

370
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
Those are

371
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
fried chicken with oil.

372
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
They are full of meat.

373
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,540
They are not famous yet.

374
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,540
They can only be used in the West.

375
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,540
These are

376
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
water-soaked fish.

377
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,540
They are not bitter or bitter.

378
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,540
They are not skinless.

379
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,540
You can eat them.

380
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,540
These are

381
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
sea-water fish.

382
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,540
These are

383
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
sea-water fish

384
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,540
that are not open.

385
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,540
Master,

386
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,540
I am a little bit afraid.

387
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
Master Gao Ming,

388
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
he is trying to save me.

389
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
I should drink this.

390
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,540
Miss An Du,

391
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
you should be more careful.

392
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,540
It has nothing to do with you.

393
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,540
I am telling this boy to lie to me.

394
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
I can't swallow this.

395
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
What is there to be angry about?

396
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,540
Master Ming is a master of art.

397
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,540
Shouldn't you be happy?

398
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,540
Master Liu Chu.

399
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,540
I didn't come to eat

400
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,540
this festival.

401
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,540
Master Liu Chu is joking.

402
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,540
As the saying goes,

403
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
there is a man who is not dead

404
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,540
and has to win the next round.

405
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
This should be called

406
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,540
the long-term banquet.

407
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,540
Sister Liu Chu.

408
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,540
Last time,

409
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
I didn't expect

410
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,540
a normal girl

411
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
to be so clever.

412
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,540
I specially prepared

413
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
some marinated water-soaked rice noodles for you.

414
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,540
Master,

415
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
I am sorry

416
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,540
for the trouble you made.

417
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,540
I am sorry.

418
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,540
I am sorry.

419
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
I am sorry.

420
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
An Du,

421
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,540
those things

422
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
have already passed.

423
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
We have to be more careful.

424
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
We have to live

425
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,540
a happy life.

426
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Thank you, sister.

427
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Don't stand there.

428
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
Come, sit down.

429
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,540
Look at me.

430
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,540
Look at me.

431
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,540
Smile.

432
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,540
Smile.

433
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,540
Don't smile.

434
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
You look like crying.

435
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,540
Hai,

436
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,540
you did a good job

437
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,540
saving An Du.

438
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,540
You are kind and meaningful.

439
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,540
Yes, you are kind and meaningful.

440
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,540
We are all here.

441
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,540
Let's have a drink

442
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,540
together.

443
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
Yes.

444
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
Let's have a drink.

445
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
Come on.

446
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Let's have a drink.

447
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
Let's have a drink.

448
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
Let's have a drink.

449
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
Let's have a drink.

450
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
Let's have a drink.

451
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,540
The moon is in the shade tonight.

452
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
There is only one star left.

453
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
But it will be full.

454
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
What's wrong with you?

455
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Although Cao Jingxian is dead,

456
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,540
I still can't wake up.

457
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
You have been out of the water for three days.

458
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,540
Your heart is being held.

459
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,540
Since I know her existence,

460
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,540
I don't think about her for no reason.

461
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
Who is she?

462
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,540
How should I kill her?

463
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
But today,

464
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,540
with you,

465
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,540
I feel like

466
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,540
my heart

467
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,540
is in a mess.

468
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
Because you are not

469
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,540
the first time

470
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,540
we met.

471
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
I'm sorry.

472
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Don't look at me like that.

473
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
I'm with her every day.

474
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
You are the one

475
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
who looks the farthest away.

476
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
I'm her teacher, too.

477
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
I didn't teach her anything.

478
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Love is like water.

479
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
Water can be in the boat.

480
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540
Water can be in the boat.

481
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Water can be in the boat.

482
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
In the end,

483
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,540
you have to rely on yourself.

484
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
It seems

485
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
the final sound you said

486
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,540
is as deep as the sound of a temple.

487
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
If love is

488
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,540
as long as the world,

489
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,540
there is a chance

490
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
to find...

491
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
Don't drink too much.

492
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,540
Yes, yes.

493
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,540
I drink too much.

494
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
Now,

495
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,540
the third and I

496
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,540
are all in the purple and black.

497
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,540
We are all in the black and white.

498
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
I look like I'm in the first place,

499
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,540
but I'm in the dark.

500
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
I'm in the dark.

501
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,540
It's possible to reflect on it.

502
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,540
I have to be careful.

503
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,540
I can't take out the copper rain

504
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
and burn the trees.

505
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
In the past,

506
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I was in the building every day,

507
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,540
watching the cherry blossoms and the cherry blossoms

508
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
in the capital.

509
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
I sometimes think,

510
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
if I really am

511
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
the boss of the building,

512
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
how good would it be?

513
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,540
But I know it clearly.

514
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
It's impossible.

515
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
This is my fate.

516
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
It's like revenge.

517
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,540
It's also your fate.

518
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,540
Don't think too much.

519
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Don't worry about us.

520
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,540
Don't worry about us either.

521
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
Being with you

522
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
is our own choice.

523
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
I, master Gao Ming,

524
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
Guan Feng, Shi Lei,

525
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,540
and even Sixth Sister,

526
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
are all willing to face

527
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
the danger of the future with you.

528
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
No.

529
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
I don't want you to be in danger

530
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
because of me.

531
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
Then you go ask master Gao Ming.

532
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
Your path of revenge

533
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
has been taken by a lot.

534
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,540
Will he let you go

535
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,540
in the end?

536
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,540
It's hard to find a way to escape,

537
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
but

538
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,540
I really don't want you

539
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,540
to be involved in this.

540
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
Protecting your family,

541
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
you have your own way.

542
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,540
I also have my ability.

543
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,540
You will solve

544
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,420
the problem of the

545
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,540
ear and my tent in the court.

546
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,540
But the sword and light

547
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,540
of the street and the alley

548
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,540
will be handed over to me.

549
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,540
All right.

550
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,540
Don't be so sad.

551
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
Tell me

552
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
what you plan to do next.

553
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,540
From the third person

554
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,540
and Cao Jin Xian's

555
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,540
tacit understanding,

556
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
this person

557
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,540
must be

558
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,540
the center of the court

559
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,540
to deal with

560
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
such a serious matter

561
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,540
in public.

562
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
I can only

563
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
rely on

564
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
the power

565
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,540
His Majesty gave me.

566
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
From Cao Jin Xian's case,

567
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
I started to investigate.

568
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,540
Your plan

569
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,540
will not be lost to the other person.

570
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,540
Now there is

571
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,540
His Majesty behind me.

572
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,540
He must be

573
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,540
able to find the enemy very soon.

574
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,540
I hope so.

575
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,540
When we find the third person

576
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,540
and get the enemy,

577
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,540
we will leave here.

578
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,540
You can go where you want to go

579
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,540
and we will go there.

580
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
All right.

581
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,540
After I get the enemy,

582
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,540
we will leave together.

583
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,540
Minister Zhang,

584
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,540
you have seen

585
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
the body of the Chang Wei.

586
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,540
Did you find anything?

587
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,540
As I have seen,

588
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,540
they have no external injuries.

589
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,540
They are dying of poisoning.

590
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,540
They have

591
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,540
a lot of flesh and skin.

592
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,540
They should be

593
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,540
poisoned with

594
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,540
a very strong fish soup.

595
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,540
These Chang Wei

596
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,540
are really loyal to the country.

597
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,540
They are willing to die

598
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
for Cao Jin Xian.

599
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,540
Minister Zuo,

600
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
do you think

601
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,540
they are willing to die?

602
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
The Chang Wei

603
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
are dying

604
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,540
in the mansion of the Cao family.

605
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,540
They are really

606
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,540
loyal to the country.

607
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
They are really like that.

608
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
But they are fighting for their lives.

609
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
They are obviously

610
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
strong and unbearable.

611
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
It is hard

612
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,540
to face the suffering

613
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,540
of the people who are

614
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
living in the capital.

615
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
I just checked

616
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,540
the finger of the body of each person.

617
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,540
Some people

618
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
have a finger and a ring.

619
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,540
Some people have a mud and sand.

620
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Even if they are dying,

621
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,540
no matter how hard it is,

622
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
they can be caught

623
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
in the mansion of the Cao family.

624
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
You mean

625
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,540
they are being moved

626
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
to the mansion

627
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,540
and disguised as

628
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,540
a poison-intensive weapon?

629
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Minister Zuo,

630
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
I'm afraid

631
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,540
we have to find the clue

632
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
not here,

633
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,540
but in Lu Yan.

634
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
Lu Yan?

635
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
There are 30 people

636
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
in the mansion of the Cao family.

637
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,540
And there are only 29 bodies here.

638
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,540
One person is missing.

639
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
It is Lu Yan.

640
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
But the Cao family

641
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,540
has been turned

642
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,540
into a sub-chamber.

643
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
They didn't find

644
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,540
his body.

645
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
I'm afraid Lu Yan

646
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
is not dead yet.

647
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,540
If it is the poison of the Cao family,

648
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
he will not be alive.

649
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
Did Lu Yan

650
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,540
find anything?

651
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
He escaped.

652
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
Or

653
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,540
he is the poison.

654
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
Only Lu Yan

655
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
will know

656
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
this problem.

657
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,540
I'll go to the capital

658
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,540
to investigate it.

659
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
By the way,

660
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
there is another person.

661
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Although he is not in the hunting field,

662
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,540
it is also related to this case.

663
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,540
Who?

664
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,540
The Sword of the Heavenly Heaven

665
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
is missing.

666
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,540
Lu Yan and Lu Fen

667
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
are now missing.

668
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
So we can't stay on this line.

669
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
We still need to go to the second room.

670
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
Now

671
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,540
the third person has been caught.

672
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
The distance is 3 equal to

673
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
only one step away.

674
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,540
He will surely open his heart.

675
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,540
Actually, the third person's range

676
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,540
is very small.

677
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540
This person can be killed

678
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
by the death of Cao Jingxian

679
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,540
and be in the hunting field for so long.

680
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Even Miss Xiang

681
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,540
can become a scapegoat.

682
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,540
There are not many people

683
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
who can be like this.

684
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
Master.

685
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,540
The emperor gave me

686
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,540
a search for the evidence.

687
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,540
I want to investigate it

688
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
from the inside.

689
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
Xiao Hai.

690
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
In that case,

691
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,540
you should see someone.

692
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
Zhang Hai.

693
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,540
You said so much.

694
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
But you have solved

695
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,540
a long-time mystery.

696
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
What mystery?

697
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
Your father

698
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
was born for me,

699
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,540
but he has nothing.

700
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
Don't ask too much.

701
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
Let's talk about the evidence.

702
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
You have been caught these days.

703
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
It seems

704
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,540
that the third person

705
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,540
is getting closer and closer.

706
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,540
You also think

707
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
that you should look into the inside?

708
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Zhuang Luying is the chief of the martial law.

709
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,540
Cao Jingxian leads the private police

710
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,540
and the guards.

711
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
The third person is in the inside.

712
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
That's not like the top.

713
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
Tell me.

714
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,540
Who do you want to investigate?

715
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,540
The top officials

716
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
in the Inner Council

717
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,540
want to have a scholar

718
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,540
who can be a scholar.

719
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,540
If you offend someone,

720
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
you will be punished

721
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,540
by the people

722
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,540
who are in charge of the martial law.

723
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,540
Since you are a scholar,

724
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,540
I want to examine

725
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,540
the first person

726
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,540
in the Inner Council.

727
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,540
The first person

728
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,540
is usually

729
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,540
the one

730
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,540
who is good at

731
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,540
protecting the Inner Council.

732
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,540
But since Cao Jingxian died,

733
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,540
he has not only not expanded

734
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,540
the whole world,

735
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,540
but also

736
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,540
has been a

737
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,540
unseemly person.

738
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,540
The third person

739
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,540
is the one who is

740
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,540
in charge of the martial law.

741
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,540
Eunuch,

742
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,540
it seems that you don't know

743
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,540
the senior of the Inner Council.

744
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,540
That's why

745
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,540
I want to see you.

746
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
The first person

747
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,540
is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

748
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

749
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

750
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

751
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

752
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

753
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

754
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

755
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

756
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

757
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

758
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

759
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
He is the one who is in charge of the martial law.

760
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,540
