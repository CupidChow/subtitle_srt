1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,360
Sesame.

2
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,600
Episode 23

3
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,660
Lotus will bloom lihat

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will return Jin Zizhou.

5
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,880
You're awake.

6
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,520
Have some water.

7
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,960
Who are you?

8
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,360
I'm your father's old friend.

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
Why should I believe you?

10
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,320
If I want to kill you,

11
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,400
I won't wait until you're awake.

12
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,360
Last night, your family was killed.

13
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,120
Except for you, I saved you.

14
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
The rest of them are in danger.

15
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,280
Cry if you want to.

16
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,880
We'll talk when you've cried enough.

17
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,200
We're here.

18
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,360
You've cried enough.

19
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,120
You should feel better now.

20
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Do you have many questions for me?

21
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,440
Before your father came back,

22
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,840
he promised me that

23
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,640
I would take you away from the capital.

24
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,480
But I was late.

25
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,240
I want to avenge them.

26
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,320
I know you're worried about them.

27
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,280
But I'm not.

28
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,080
I'm not.

29
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm not.

30
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,680
I'm not.

31
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,400
I'm not.

32
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,160
I'm not.

33
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,960
I'm not.

34
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,880
I'm not.

35
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm not.

36
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm not.

37
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,760
Do you know who your enemy is?

38
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,200
My father called him by his name.

39
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,480
The leader is

40
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Zhuang Luyin.

41
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,040
No wonder you have such a trick.

42
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
You're Pingjing Duke.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,440
But your father and he have no grudge.

44
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,880
Why did he do that?

45
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,880
He asked my father for something.

46
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,040
What?

47
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,520
I don't know.

48
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,560
My father didn't tell me.

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,400
Your father brought something back from the capital.

50
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,120
And Pingjing Duke

51
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,320
tried to destroy your family.

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,160
If he knows you're still alive,

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,440
it'll be very dangerous.

54
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
You can't change

55
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,680
what happened last night.

56
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,560
Are you sure you want to avenge them?

57
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,840
If I can't avenge them,

58
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,760
I'd rather die.

59
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,280
If you want to do as I said,

60
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,880
I have a way to help you.

61
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Please tell me.

62
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,680
Pingjing Duke is powerful and powerful.

63
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,320
It takes time to avenge them.

64
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,320
You need to learn the skills.

65
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
How long?

66
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,560
At least ten years.

67
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,280
I'll send you to a place where you can learn.

68
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,080
You can do it by yourself.

69
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,360
Hurry up.

70
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
The master is coming.

71
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
Who's the master?

72
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,400
Your master.

73
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
Master?

74
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,560
You're Kuai Tuo's son.

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
Come down and let me see.

76
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,960
I want to make it clear to you.

77
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,200
You won't have any advantage

78
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,080
in my place.

79
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,640
If you can't suffer,

80
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,280
you can just leave.

81
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,560
I won't stop you.

82
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,080
I want to learn martial arts.

83
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
You're strong and soft.

84
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,320
You're not a good fighter.

85
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,800
You're not a good fighter.

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,160
I've already designed a revenge plan for you.

87
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,520
You just follow this path

88
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,520
and you'll get what you want.

89
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,080
I want to know

90
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,360
how to kill my enemy.

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,000
If it's not the best martial arts,

92
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,400
I won't learn it.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,960
Do you have to use your strength to avenge?

94
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
What else can I do?

95
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,560
You have to believe.

96
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,320
If you have this idea,

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,160
you can kill anyone in the world.

98
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,320
Wu Cun.

99
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,520
Yes.

100
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,160
The right sleeve is one inch shorter than the left one.

101
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,360
You're not careful enough.

102
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
The people in this room

103
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,840
won't need to eat for three days.

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
If there's another time

105
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,440
you break the small bone

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,320
and kick them out of the mansion,

107
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,600
you don't need to come back.

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,880
Master.

109
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,520
Why are you so mean?

110
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,840
It's all a small matter.

111
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,600
You haven't learned it yet.

112
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
You're already questioning it.

113
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,080
It seems that your parents

114
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,840
are also not good at teaching you.

115
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,560
Don't talk about my parents.

116
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,080
Wu Cun.

117
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,560
What?

118
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
What's wrong with my face?

119
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Don't panic.

120
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
It just微调了你的眉眼和骨相

121
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,680
and re-concentrate on it.

122
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,080
It seems

123
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,000
it's different from before.

124
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,120
When you grow up,

125
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,440
your mom and dad

126
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,400
will be gone.

127
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,920
And your enemy won't recognize you.

128
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,960
In a few years,

129
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,560
my face

130
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,640
won't have my parents' marks.

131
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,920
Tell me.

132
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,120
When did you get the wound on your back?

133
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
I've seen it before.

134
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,240
Only a few days ago.

135
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,680
Have you seen your enemy?

136
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,560
That's good.

137
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
The wound on your back

138
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
is too deep.

139
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,760
The star jade can only be handled as much as possible,

140
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,040
and make the wound heal faster.

141
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,320
Try to make the scar lighter.

142
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,840
Who is the star jade?

143
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,240
It's that

144
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,120
weird-tempered guy.

145
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,480
Who are you?

146
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,960
I'm Gao Ming,

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,600
your other master.

148
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,360
What can you teach me?

149
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,040
You brat.

150
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,720
Don't look down on me.

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,560
If you think you know everything,

152
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,720
try to get out of here.

153
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
Your master is cruel.

154
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,840
If you can't get out,

155
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,840
you'll starve to death.

156
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,560
Let me eat first.

157
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,320
I'll come back to get the scar

158
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,520
when I have the strength.

159
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,200
You were born in a rich family.

160
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,840
If you can't even get the scar,

161
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,680
I think your father is a good man.

162
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,520
Don't talk about my father.

163
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
You promised my father

164
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,480
to teach me how to revenge.

165
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,520
I don't believe

166
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,160
you can starve me to death.

167
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,880
I did promise him

168
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,400
to teach me how to revenge.

169
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,960
But I can't.

170
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
I'm not going to let you go.

171
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,200
I'm not going to let you go.

172
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,560
I'm not going to let you go.

173
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,960
I'm not going to let you go.

174
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm not going to let you go.

175
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,480
But you've changed.

176
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,240
I'll find another child

177
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
to replace you.

178
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,040
You...

179
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,240
You want to test me?

180
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,360
My father has taught me everything.

181
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
I'll show you now.

182
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,960
The child just finished the art of art.

183
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,240
His body is so weak.

184
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,840
If he really dies,

185
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,760
I'll see how you explain to the master.

186
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,920
He can't stand the hunger and pain.

187
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,960
He's afraid of the smell.

188
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,920
He's young.

189
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,920
He's so strong.

190
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,440
He's a good boy.

191
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,960
Let's go.

192
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,160
If you don't come out today,

193
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,280
you'll starve to death.

194
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,600
You hate me.

195
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,760
Because you hate my father.

196
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,760
My father is good at medical science.

197
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
He's the best看玉家 in the world.

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
You're not as good as him.

199
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,400
You're not as good as him.

200
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,800
You said your father is good at medical science.

201
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,400
There's a medical science master in the previous dynasty

202
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,440
named He Mengui.

203
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,360
Do you know him?

204
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,800
Of course I know him.

205
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,040
Then you recite

206
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,240
the art of giving and drinking and training.

207
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
The right way is not necessary to talk about the road.

208
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,520
Tai Xuan, repair, ask Yang Xiong.

209
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,040
The road has been loved since childhood.

210
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,400
Watching the stars,

211
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,040
Yang Xiong was a young man who liked to study.

212
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,000
He left the work Tai Xuan.

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,320
It has been the deepest wisdom in the universe.

214
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Learned it,

215
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,520
you can also become

216
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,120
a great person like them.

217
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,320
Come on, let's continue to recite.

218
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,000
Where does the wind come from?

219
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,800
The wind comes from the wind.

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,400
The wind is blowing.

221
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,480
The wind rises in the end of the horizon.

222
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
A gentleman must move at the right time.

223
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,440
Do it at the right time.

224
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,880
If you want to revenge,

225
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,400
you have to learn the change of the wind.

226
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,800
There are told to be a tree attached.

227
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,520
There are told to be a tree attached.

228
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
On the left hand side of the town,

229
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,800
they enter four doors.

230
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,580
Running two doors.

231
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,520
I planned the pen of strength.

232
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,080
Some men pressed the pen.

233
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,480
Others left.

234
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,360
One bisogn for a long time.

235
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
I...

236
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
I can do it.

237
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
After four lives,

238
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
the West State is in fear.

239
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
For the past three days,

240
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
the late Emperor and late Emperor

241
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
have been unable to

242
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
cross the Hanguan Road.

243
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
The late Emperor and late Emperor

244
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
have been unable to

245
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
cross the Hanguan Road.

246
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Where did the late Emperor

247
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
come from?

248
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
What is he doing?

249
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Let's go.

250
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Let's go.

251
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Come.

252
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Come.

253
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Come.

254
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Come.

255
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Half a month later,

256
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
you learned to watch fish and fish-fishing

257
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
and in the afternoon,

258
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
you learned to cross the Hanguan Road with Gao Ming.

259
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
You get up at 10 a.m. every day

260
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
and sleep at 9 a.m.

261
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
without any delay.

262
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
I...

263
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
I...

264
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
I...

265
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
I...

266
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Kid, are you hungry?

267
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Let's go eat.

268
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Be careful.

269
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Social culture

270
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Health and own wealth

271
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
remember the stick,

272
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,360
make it bold.

273
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,740
är

274
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,360
The dusk reaches the heavens

275
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
When the midnight arrives

276
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Our families of villages and villages

277
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:08,040
become black from the autumn

278
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,000
Tears have fallen

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,120
If you want to learn some useful requirement,

280
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,040
you must should know the local position,

281
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,120
flows and background conditions.

282
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,240
At schools,

283
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,120
gewd during finals

284
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,400
The staff is nice,

285
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:38,880
but why

286
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,720
don't you arrest them all to remind

287
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
What's wrong?

288
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,360
The hole is one centimeter short.

289
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,920
Just one centimeter?

290
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,480
If you miss a good one,

291
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,640
you'll lose a thousand.

292
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,400
If you miss a good one,

293
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,520
you'll be dead.

294
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,000
Master,

295
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,680
you're growing a beard.

296
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,920
Today, I'll show you my true skills.

297
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,680
What are you doing?

298
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,560
Go away!

299
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,440
You're blind!

300
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,000
Even the county magistrate dares to hit you?

301
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,760
Write it down.

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,320
You can't even block a small line.

303
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,200
Look at what you've done here.

304
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,360
The officials only know to make money.

305
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,160
They'll be buried in the silver team sooner or later.

306
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,400
Yes.

307
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,880
If I hadn't come here before the imperial jade,

308
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm afraid that

309
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,200
your deeds wouldn't be enough to kill you.

310
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,720
Yes.

311
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,200
Come on.

312
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,840
I'll give you a chance to change your mind.

313
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,520
You can pay back what you've lost.

314
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,360
Those officials

315
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,160
want to catch and kill.

316
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,080
You know what you're doing.

317
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,040
Don't be afraid.

318
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,480
There must be someone behind you.

319
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:56,960
Yes.

320
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,920
You didn't wear a uniform or a carriage.

321
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,600
Why doesn't he trust you?

322
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,760
Didn't you just call me master?

323
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,880
What you want to do

324
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,800
is to make people believe

325
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
what you want them to believe.

326
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,360
Most importantly,

327
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,960
you don't need to be so real.

328
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,240
You don't need to be so like.

329
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,400
You need to know what they're most afraid of

330
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,560
and what they want.

331
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,800
The Zongheng art involves the world's knowledge.

332
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
You need to be well-versed in every aspect.

333
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,440
With your three-inch tongue,

334
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,360
you can be better than a million.

335
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
The Zongheng art involves the world's knowledge.

336
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
You need to be well-versed in every aspect.

337
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
With your three-inch tongue,

338
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
you can be better than a million.

339
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
With your three-inch tongue,

340
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
you can be better than a million.

341
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,080
Go now.

342
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,920
Be careful.

343
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,000
Be careful.

344
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,120
Go now.

345
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,640
This kid's made craft

346
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,440
can be maintained completely now.

347
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,920
You've been making your apprenticeWhat are you expecting?

348
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,760
Aren't you nervous?

349
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,680
OK

350
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,080
Fine

351
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,360
Let's have a Plaza tonight

352
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,840
Drinking with ширiness

353
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,600
Master

354
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,200
What does it say on the letter?

355
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
Your new master

356
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,000
is coming soon

357
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,320
I have a new master?

358
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,640
You're not so tall

359
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,480
he should be coming

360
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,080
I feel you two are strange today

361
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,800
Is this new master very powerful?

362
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,640
You'll know when you see it

363
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,680
Tonight, we will go to Biguan

364
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,440
We will come back tomorrow

365
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,120
You stay in the mansion

366
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,080
Yes, master

367
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,840

You want to make up an две

369
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
For your new master

370
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,400
It's better to be mine

371
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,480
Xing, I get it

372
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,040
I'm still worried

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,160
Or master stay and eat with me

374
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,960
Enough

375
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,280
OK

376
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,960
I'm leaving

377
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,400
Rest assured

378
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
You are my third master.

382
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
What?

383
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,760
I never thought that your new master would be a woman.

384
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
I am Sixth Uncle.

385
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Sixth Uncle, hello.

386
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Oh, right.

387
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,760
This is what Master Gao Ming asked me to bring for you.

388
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
Put it down first.

389
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
What do you want to teach me?

390
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
What?

391
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Didn't they tell you?

392
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,760
They reminded you that you are weird.

393
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,760
I thought you were very scary.

394
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
I am sorry.

395
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
I didn't mean to be rude.

396
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,760
I just wanted to remind you that you are very scary.

397
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,760
Then do you think I am scary?

398
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I am here to teach you about the things between men and women.

399
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Today, you only need to learn one thing.

400
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,760
How to reject the softness and meaning of women.

401
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,760
How to reject their little pity.

402
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
I am talking to you.

403
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,760
But if you don't know how to do it, it doesn't matter.

404
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,760
After all, I am not someone who can meet anyone I want to meet.

405
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
I am sorry.

406
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
What's wrong?

407
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
I thought you were here to teach me how to take revenge.

408
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,760
You know how to suppress desire with pain.

409
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
Not bad.

410
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,760
But this time, although you resisted the temptation temporarily with your own heart,

411
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,760
in the future, if you really meet a woman who really loves you,

412
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
you may not be like today.

413
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,760
In the future, you will meet many people.

414
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,760
There are men, women, enemies, and friends.

415
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Men are like stones, strong and strong.

416
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Women are like water, gentle and strong.

417
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
They are deep and deep.

418
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,760
There are many questions in the love.

419
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,760
But the hardest thing to prevent in this world is the true heart.

420
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
True heart?

421
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
Even the true heart needs to be prepared?

422
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,760
You met your parents ten years ago, right?

423
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,760
Do you remember their appearance clearly?

424
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Actually, I am the same as you.

425
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
I was an orphan when I was very young.

426
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Although I still remember the day my parents left,

427
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,760
I can't remember their appearance clearly.

428
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Do you think I am unfilial?

429
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Of course not.

430
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
You...

431
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
You just can't help but believe it.

432
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Do you remember that I loved to eat the pomegranate when I was young?

433
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,760
My father planted pomegranate trees in the yard.

434
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,760
My father picked pomegranate, my mother made pomegranate, and I ate pomegranate.

435
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,760
I was so happy at that time.

436
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Me too.

437
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
I loved to eat roasted duck.

438
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,760
Every time my father gave me a salary, he would go out and buy it for me.

439
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
He would buy it for me.

440
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Who would have thought that was the last happy moment in my life?

441
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,760
If I have a chance, I really want to see my parents again.

442
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,760
So I can remember their appearance more clearly.

443
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:44,760
I think you and I are the same.

444
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,760
If I am your enemy, you are dead now.

445
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
It's not hard to resist desire.

446
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
It's not hard to live.

447
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,760
What's hard is to resist the temptation of emotions.

448
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
This...

449
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
This is not fair.

450
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
There is not so much fairness in this world.

451
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,760
There are many things that can't be repeated.

452
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
I understand.

453
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
I want to put my heart tighter and tighter.

454
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
I can't even get a little wind in it.

455
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
I don't love anyone.

456
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
But this is not enough.

457
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,760
You not only want to wrap yourself up, but also have to make your emotions pure.

458
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Make people think that you are crying and laughing.

459
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,760
In this way, no one will find that I hide my true heart.

460
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Naturally, there will be no flaws.

461
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Although you say so, can you do it?

462
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
I can definitely do it.

463
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,760
You are still young and smart.

464
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
But you are a man of character.

465
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,760
This may become the biggest obstacle on your way to revenge in the future.

466
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,760
But maybe it will be the key to your victory in the future.

467
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
I'm leaving.

468
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Master Six.

469
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Then is this level over?

470
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,760
My class is different from your two masters.

471
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Some people can learn about emotions when they are born.

472
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Some people don't understand it even after learning it for a lifetime.

473
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Remember, you only passed half of today's level.

474
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,760
You must be careful and cautious in the future.

475
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
You must not fall in love easily.

476
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Master Six, you lied to me again.

477
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
Master Six didn't drink at all.

478
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
I think you want to drink it.

479
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,760
It's normal for your Master Six to see too much fruit in Beijing and not like the wine here.

480
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Then don't you worry about me?

481
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,760
I only passed half of Master Six's level.

482
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Emotions need talent.

483
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,760
I'm not a man of character.

484
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,760
You can only pass half of the level of Master Six.

485
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
You've already given me the last chance.

486
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Look at your Master Six.

487
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,760
His heart is like a rock.

488
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Otherwise, how could he hide in the deep mountains and old forests?

489
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
He's not afraid to ruin himself.

490
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,760
No one can fool him.

491
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
And you,

492
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,760
you are easily fooled by emotions.

493
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
You are not a man of character.

494
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Emotions are the easiest to be fooled.

495
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
When can I have a baby?

496
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
Silly boy,

497
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,760
living and learning is the way to be a man.

498
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
Then I will never be able to catch up with you.

499
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Because you are older than me.

500
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,760
You rascal, who are you scolding?

501
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Stand there.

502
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
I dare not.

503
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,760
I just want to learn your ability as soon as possible.

504
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Master, please.

505
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
There's a saying,

506
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,760
if you want to be a man, you can't answer.

507
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
One day you will understand,

508
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
the most powerful ability in the world

509
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,760
is to use the truth to deceive people.

510
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
When I was your age,

511
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
I also thought this was a profound truth.

512
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,760
Later, I learned it slowly

513
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,760
because I ate too much.

514
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
You mean,

515
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
I still need to learn?

516
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
You mean,

517
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
you were fooled again.

518
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
You are a talented master.

519
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
You are born to meet people.

520
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
How can you believe that someone can let me eat?

521
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
It's too tender.

522
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
Come on.

523
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Here you are.

524
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Master.

525
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Master.

526
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
I haven't seen you for years.

527
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
You have grown up.

528
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Take a look.

529
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
General lock.

530
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,760
It seems that you have been doing well these years.

531
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
The masters treat me very well.

532
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,760
I heard that you have learned a lot of skills.

533
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
I wake up at dawn every day and sleep at night.

534
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
I never slack off.

535
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Don't you think it's boring to learn?

536
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
When I'm bored,

537
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
I count the bricks and tiles in the hall.

538
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Then,

539
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
I will go to the hall.

540
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
I will go to the hall.

541
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
I will go to the hall.

542
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,760
How many bricks are there on the ground?

543
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
3,381.

544
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
How many tiles are there on the floor?

545
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
48,300.

546
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
How many people died that night?

547
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
Ten people were killed by the man in black.

548
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
I saw the sound of the brother's dog being cut off by someone.

549
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
My sister's mother died in the sword.

550
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Fourteen people died that night.

551
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
It's been 3,325 days.

552
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,760
I can't believe it's been so many years.

553
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Your heart is still strong as before.

554
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Your hatred has not been eliminated at all.

555
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,760
You are carefree here.

556
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,760
I thought one day it would be forgotten.

557
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Master taught me.

558
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
I'm not afraid of anyone.

559
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
I'm not afraid of anyone.

560
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
I'm not afraid of anyone.

561
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,760
I'm not afraid of anyone.

562
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Master taught me.

563
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
You don't have to write your hatred on your face.

564
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
Just put it in your heart.

565
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
The heart is yours.

566
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Others can't see it.

567
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
The face is outside.

568
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Everyone can see it.

569
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
This is your birthday gift this year.

570
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,760
See if you like it.

571
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
This...

572
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
He is your enemy.

573
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Marquis Pingjing Zhuang Luyin.

574
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
That's right.

575
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
It's him.

576
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
I remember Hua Chenhui.

577
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Marquis Pingjing has been a horse for half his life.

578
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,760
His hands are covered with blood.

579
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
He is not only good at martial arts.

580
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,760
And he is very cautious.

581
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,760
He doesn't wear a golden armor all the time.

582
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,760
His guards are all over the place.

583
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,760
If you want to kill him,

584
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,760
it's hard.

585
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,760
You can only do it.

586
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
How can I get close to him?

587
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,760
You have to find a chance to be his assistant.

588
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,760
So Master has been teaching me how to follow the line.

589
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
There are three people around Marquis Pingjing.

590
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
They are between you and him.

591
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,760
If you want to get close to him,

592
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,760
you have to pass these three levels first.

593
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
His name is Qu Jiao.

594
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,760
He is Marquis Pingjing's personal guard.

595
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,760
He is also his commander.

596
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
He killed people for Marquis Pingjing.

597
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,760
He is very cruel.

598
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,760
He killed my family.

599
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Chu Huai Ming?

600
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:35,440
He was a

601
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
He betrayed your father.

602
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,440
He surrendered to Marquis Pingjing.

603
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,440
After your father died,

604
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,440
he took the position of the imperial guard.

605
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,440
He is very cruel.

606
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
You will be his guard.

607
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,440
He will be his target.

608
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
His name is Yang Zhen.

609
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,440
He is Marquis Pingjing's first target.

610
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,440
He killed people for Marquis Pingjing

611
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,440
to protect Marquis Pingjing.

612
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,440
He is very cunning.

613
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,440
He is very angry with Marquis Pingjing.

614
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,440
He is also the target of Marquis's mansion.

615
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,440
If you are in Marquis's mansion,

616
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,440
you will be under his suppression.

617
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,440
This is Marquis Pingjing's list.

618
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Everyone is in a difficult position.

619
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,440
The Marquis's mansion is complicated.

620
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,440
You must not be careless.

621
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Eunuch,

622
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
I have a question.

623
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Eunuch,

624
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
you showed me these.

625
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Is it that

626
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,440
I am going back to the capital?

627
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
I haven't left the capital yet.

628
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Is it too early to go back to the capital?

629
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Something big happened in the capital.

630
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,440
The Empress Dowager passed away three days ago.

631
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,440
The court was in grief.

632
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
I see.

633
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
I see.

634
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,440
This is an auspicious opportunity.

635
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,440
I'm afraid it will be difficult to have it again.

636
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Zhinong,

637
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,440
Qianlong must be in the wrong.

638
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,440
You can leave tomorrow.

639
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Zhinong has been studying for many years.

640
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
This is the moment.

641
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Besides using your years of study to integrate and integrate,

642
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
you must be extra cautious

643
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,440
and move in the direction of the plan

644
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,440
so that you can keep yourself in the place of the cloud in the capital

645
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,440
and try to take revenge.

646
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,440
I have prepared a new identity for you.

647
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,440
You must be clear-cut.

648
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,440
From now on, you only have one name.

649
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Zang Hai.

650
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,440
The Empress Dowager passed away.

651
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Are you thinking about what the creditors are talking about with Xindong's dad?

652
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Why is it a good opportunity for the Empress Dowager to pass away?

653
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,800
Will you go to the new city with me?

654
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,640
Of course

655
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,280
Really

656
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,040
I want to stay with you all the time

657
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,520
I'm so tired

658
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,840
I'm not tired

659
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,160
Eat

660
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,360
Eat white bones

661
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
That's about right

662
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,640
You are so sensible

663
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,280
Me太久就不见了

664
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,360
This morning

665
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,400
We need to report that

666
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,440
Xingte has been survived

667
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,640
It's good

668
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,640
Keep going

669
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,400
This morning

670
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,320
boleh对毛 fought十次

671
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:13,160
Aren't they

672
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:14,600
baby

673
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,440
Don'tWork

674
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:15,920
you

675
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,280
After all

676
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,360
I hope there is a baby

677
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm sorry.

678
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
He has already left with your benefactor.

679
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
He also told me to tell you

680
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,440
not to trust others because of your feelings.

681
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,440
That will only disappoint you.

682
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Zhinu.

683
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Master, who are you calling?

684
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,440
My name is Zang Hai.

685
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,440
From now on, in this world,

686
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,440
no one is called Zhinu.

687
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Zhinu.

688
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
The first time I saw you, I was so happy.

689
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
I was so happy.

690
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440

I was so happy.

697
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
I was so happy.

698
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
I was so happy.

699
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
I was so happy.

700
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
I was so happy.

701
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
I was so happy.

702
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
I was so happy.

703
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
I was so happy.

I was so happy.

708
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
I was so happy.

709
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
I was so happy.

710
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
I was so happy.

711
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
I was so happy.

712
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
I was so happy.

713
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
I was so happy.

714
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
I was so happy.

715
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
I was so happy.

716
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
I was so happy.

717
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,440
I was so happy.

718
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
I was so happy.

719
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,440
I was so happy.

720
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
I was so happy.

721
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
I was so happy.

722
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
I was so happy.

723
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
I was so happy.

724
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
I was so happy.

725

727
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
I was so happy.

I was so happy.

731
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
I was so happy.

732
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
I was so happy.

733
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440

744
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,440
You are also me.
