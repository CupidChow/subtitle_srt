1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
An Tu.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't be afraid.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Everything is over here.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Mo Ji.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mother.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She's in the sea.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't worry.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She's not dead.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm not her enemy.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She's not dead?

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm not her enemy.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My daughter.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I've been suffering for you these days.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't think I've been suffering.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
These days...

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I feel really sad these days.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But...

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I feel like a nightmare is over.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I like her very much.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want to be with her.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Can you promise me?

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can see that she likes you very much.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But she still has a grudge against me.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm afraid that you'll never get the first one.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't expect that the Eastern Xia Queen

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
wasn't the third person.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But this is what Pingjing Duke told Zhuang Zhi Xing.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Did Pingjing Duke not tell the truth?

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Zhuang Zhi Xing is Pingjing Duke's son.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's the only son.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What's the reason for his lie?

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Zhuang Zhi Xing is the monster that I caused.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He's also the kind of person that I hate.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He hates his father, but he hates me more.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I just didn't expect that he's already at this point.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We'll see.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hold on a second.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't move, don't move.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
輕 down, I'm about to...

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's okay.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I won't be able to save money

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
if I don't take good care of it.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
These are better days.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're already thin.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It seems like he didn't know what's good about it.

68
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,700
He didn't.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,700
He didn't treat me that well.

70
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Then why are you so sad?

71
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Why?

72
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,000
Although my mother and his misunderstanding are solved,

73
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,500
Li said that I had nothing to do with him.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
But my mother didn't want me to be with him.

75
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,700
She was afraid that I would suffer and be unhappy.

76
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,200
You never cared about others' opinions.

77
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,200
You never cared about others' stubbornness.

78
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,700
I know very well that he has his hatred.

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,700
I have my responsibility.

80
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Boss Xiang, who is free and free,

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
is not the real me.

82
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
I think you two are both very bad.

83
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
You are very good-looking.

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,700
If you are going to be a king,

85
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,200
you should talk about it.

86
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Don't you want to put this capital in the place of fate?

87
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,700
Dad, don't be so good-looking.

88
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,200
No wonder your daughter is so upset with you.

89
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,700
She is the one who made you and your father fall in love.

90
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,700
I didn't expect that my father and his wife had such a bad relationship.

91
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
The queen is not your enemy.

92
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,200
The third person's clue is completely gone.

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
But at least there is no big mistake.

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Then are you angry?

95
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Master,

96
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I am angry because I have a son.

97
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
But you are very angry.

98
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Master,

99
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,700
I just want to say that you are too tender to women.

100
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,700
When did you say that?

101
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
I...

102
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Fine, fine, fine.

103
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
You are right.

104
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
Master,

105
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Miss Xiang sent a letter to me.

106
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Please go to the clinic.

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,700
Oh no.

108
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Oh no, oh no.

109
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
I'll go and see.

110
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,700
Wait a minute.

111
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Don't be so arrogant.

112
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Your sixth master is not here.

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
I can't teach you much.

114
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Here.

115
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Where is he?

116
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
He...

117
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
He left.

118
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,200
When you finish your words, he should be back.

119
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Master, please.

120
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
The door is open today.

121
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Please follow me.

122
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
The door is open today.

123
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
Please follow me.

124
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Our lady is inside.

125
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Master, please come in.

126
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Master.

127
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
Your highness.

128
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Your highness.

129
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Stop.

130
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,800
Today's film starts with a little fish.

131
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
One day,

132
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
the little fish and the family are gone.

133
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,560
They can't find their home anymore.

134
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,360
They are swimming in the water.

135
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Swimming.

136
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,960
One little bird is pitiful.

137
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,960
They have been with him.

138
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,920
They became good friends.

139
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,240
Little bird is not good for the little fish.

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,520
They have been helping him and taking care of him.

141
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
It's been a long time.

142
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,400
Little bird also likes this little fish.

143
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
But how do you know?

144
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,360
This little fish is not only stupid,

145
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,320
but also very evil.

146
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,120
He is smart.

147
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,960
He thinks that Little bird's mother

148
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,720
is his parents.

149
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,800
No matter how good Little bird is to him,

150
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,760
he will kill his mother and avenge his family.

151
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,480
Of course, Little bird will stop him.

152
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Because he knows that

153
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,000
the little fish is very hard-hearted.

154
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,880
After all, he is not his mother's opponent.

155
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
Little bird is too difficult.

156
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
He can't bear to let Little fish

157
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,200
or his own mother.

158
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,720
He can only use his own life

159
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,000
to solve the hatred in Little fish's heart.

160
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
But who knows?

161
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
Little fish's parents

162
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
are not Little bird's mother.

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,720
Little fish who knows the truth

164
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,200
has never cared about Little bird's death.

165
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,800
He just left her alone

166
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,040
and left her alone.

167
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,560
Tell me.

168
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,640
Should Little fish die?

169
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,200
Yes.

170
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,600
Luckily, Little bird is still alive.

171
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,120
Otherwise,

172
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,720
Little fish can't live on.

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,240
His heart is dead.

174
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,680
He can't live on.

175
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,840
Little fish is sorry to Little bird.

176
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,840
I don't want his forgiveness.

177
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,520
Then, Little bird

178
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,520
is still willing to see him?

179
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,280
Just a little look for him.

180
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
Little bird is waiting

181
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,340
Come on!

182
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,780
What's wrong with you.

183
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,940
Your Royal Highness.

184
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,800
Are you hurt.

185
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,560
You're still injured?

186
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

187
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

188
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

189
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

190
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

191
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

192
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

194
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

195
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

196
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

197
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

198
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

199
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

200
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,800
SOF

201
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,440
SoF

202
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,760
Jinxiu

203
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,320
...

204
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,200
Your Highness

205
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,080
After the estãoゃe

206
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,440
is necessary again.

207
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,640
I've just kept it 005 dumbbells.

208
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
You dare to call me your highness?

209
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
An Tu.

210
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
You said you were so cold to me.

211
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,640
You should have thought of today.

212
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I...

213
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
I don't know how to say it.

214
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
I don't allow you to say that.

215
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
In the future, as long as I look for you,

216
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
you must come to see me.

217
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Okay, I promise you.

218
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
An Tu.

219
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
I hope that every day I am here,

220
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
you can be happier and more talented.

221
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Of course, I am happy and talented.

222
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
I am the princess of the east.

223
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
I am the boss of the whole building.

224
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,640
My family, friends, and loved ones.

225
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
I have them now.

226
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Why are you laughing?

227
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
I am too greedy.

228
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
Can't I be greedy?

229
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,640
You have a big eye.

230
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
You are a little angel.

231
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
It's not because of you.

232
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
Yes.

233
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
I am wrong.

234
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,640
Please don't be cruel to Miss Xiang.

235
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,640
I will come to your building to be a guest.

236
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
I am not greedy.

237
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
I am greedy.

238
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
I am a guest.

239
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Miss.

240
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Zang Hai.

241
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
My mother is here.

242
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
You are here too.

243
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
The misunderstanding has been solved.

244
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I feel very relieved.

245
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Then you can sleep well tonight.

246
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
I won't cry.

247
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I will be here tonight.

248
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
I will be here tonight.

249
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
I will be here tonight.

250
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,640
I will be here tonight.

251
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I am not sleepy.

252
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
I won't be a guest tonight.

253
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
As long as I think about it,

254
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,640
no one will come in the next few days.

255
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,640
I want you to tell me everything tonight.

256
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Today?

257
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
It's a long day.

258
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
I will tell you later.

259
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
You are injured.

260
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
You need to rest.

261
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Okay.

262
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
I will tell you.

263
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
What do you want to hear?

264
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Anything.

265
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
You can say it first.

266
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Then I will tell you the two words I love from ten years ago.

267
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Zang Hai.

268
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
I won't say it.

269
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I won't say it.

270
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Dai Zi.

271
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Tell me.

272
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,640
What did my mother tell you?

273
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Actually, I didn't expect that

274
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
my father and your mother

275
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
would have known each other ten years ago.

276
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
What?

277
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Ten years ago,

278
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
my father was repairing the fan stage in the east.

279
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
As a result, the sound of the tea and the sun were wrong.

280
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
Your mother saved it.

281
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
So you say that

282
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,640
there is such a coincidence in this world.

283
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Ten years ago, I saw you.

284
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Ten years later, I went back to the capital for the first time.

285
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
And I saw you again.

286
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
And then,

287
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
so many things happened.

288
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Actually, I have a lot to say to you.

289
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,640
But I can't tell you the truth.

290
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
An Tu.

291
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,640
The painting is called Ghost-Way.

292
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,640
The ancestors of our East are the descendants of the Kulun Mountain

293
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
of the Xiling Shemu.

294
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,640
The Ghost-Way is the name of the ancestors of the East.

295
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Later, there were some changes.

296
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Our ancestors left Kulun Mountain

297
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
and went to the east.

298
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,640
They swear that they will open the land there

299
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
and save the rest of the world.

300
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Soon, on the north side of the Liaokuo Garden,

301
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
there was a female general.

302
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,640
She was fearless and brave.

303
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,640
The rumor said that she had a ghost-way.

304
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,640
The ghost-way can summon the soldiers

305
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,640
and put it on the living to fight for her.

306
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Later, she became the king herself.

307
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
She was the first king in the East,

308
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
the female king of Fu.

309
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
The rumor said that the female king of Fu was called the queen.

310
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
She was in the palace and was in the war.

311
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,640
But her body was slowly changing.

312
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
The female king of Fu was called the queen.

313
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Her body was slowly changing.

314
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
In her last moments of her life,

315
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,640
no one has ever seen her real face.

316
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,640
The female king of Fu was the one who used the ghost-way.

317
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,640
So she let the ghost-way be sealed forever.

318
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
She was buried in her body.

319
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
She was the queen.

320
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
She was never allowed to open the land.

321
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
About 300 years later,

322
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,640
her descendants, Mingli and Huda,

323
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
were my mother.

324
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
I was taken to the palace

325
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
to get rid of the ghost-way

326
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,640
and the key to open the ghost-way.

327
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Those three were the same.

328
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
You know what happened later.

329
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,640
In the battle between the two armies

330
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,640
in the battle between the two armies

331
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
in the Wuhe 35 years,

332
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
the East Asia used the ghost-way to win the war.

333
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,640
But it also paid a terrible price.

334
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Before the death of the queen,

335
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
the ghost-way was sealed

336
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
and buried in a place where no one knew.

337
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
In the past nine years,

338
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
the ghost-way was still found by your father.

339
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
For the past 100 years,

340
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
the legend of the ghost-way

341
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
has made countless people feel safe.

342
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
When they know the power behind the ghost-way,

343
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,640
they will pay all the price to get it.

344
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
All these years,

345
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,640
I've been searching for the death of the ghost-way.

346
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Finally, I found this treasure.

347
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
As long as I put the copper fish

348
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,640
on the needle in the center of the rope,

349
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,640
the fish will only go to the place where the ghost-way is located.

350
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
I worked with Cao Jingxian before,

351
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
but it was for the same girl.

352
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,640
But now, I don't need her anymore.

353
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
What did you do?

354
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Until today,

355
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,640
your third enemy is still hiding in the secret place of the ghost-way.

356
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
As long as you are willing to help me find the ghost-way,

357
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
I'll help you find the third enemy

358
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,640
and avenge the Kui family.

359
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm willing to do as you say.

360
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
I'll go and meet your highness.

361
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Don't worry.

362
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,640
There's something I need to tell you.

363
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Your highness, please tell me.

364
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,640
You can only choose one between Luo Pan and my daughter.

365
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
You choose Luo Pan,

366
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
but you choose to continue to revenge.

367
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
I don't want my daughter

368
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,640
to be with a man who's grieved and grieved.

369
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
But if you choose my daughter,

370
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,640
I want you to give up on revenge.

371
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Don't play the game of ghost-way.

372
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Mother.

373
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Don't you want to hear how Zang Hai will answer?

374
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Your highness, I can't choose.

375
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,640
My father left me a message before he died.

376
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
I didn't understand it at all.

377
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
But after your father and I heard the story,

378
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
I finally understood it.

379
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
So the message my father left before he died

380
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
was for your highness.

381
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
I'll give you a choice.

382
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Your highness, you want to know

383
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
or you want me to make a choice?

384
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
You're threatening me.

385
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Your highness, you can be sincere to my father.

386
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
Then why can't I be sincere

387
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
to the feelings I have for my father?

388
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Mother.

389
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
I'm your daughter.

390
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
It's my wish and responsibility

391
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
to find the ghost-way.

392
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
Since I came to Da Yong,

393
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
I've been in danger by your side.

394
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
I've never been afraid of the ghost-way.

395
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
I won't be afraid of it.

396
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
I see.

397
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
I'm afraid your horse

398
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
will be far more far away

399
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
than your father.

400
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Let me see

401
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
how capable you are.

402
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
I'll go and get it.

403
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Thank you for your help, your highness.

404
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
From now on,

405
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
we are the allies of the life and death.

406
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
This way to the right.

407
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Left again.

408
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
To the right.

409
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Left again.

410
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
Left again.

411
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,640
To the right.

412
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Your highness,

413
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
we can't go to the right.

414
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
Stop.

415
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
Stop.

416
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
Your highness.

417
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Your highness, please.

418
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
You guys take a good rest.

419
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
I'll go somewhere else to see

420
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
if there's anything else

421
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
that needs to be done.

422
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Yes, your highness.

423
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Who's coming?

424
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
The Minister of Justice, Zang Hai.

425
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
The day after tomorrow,

426
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
the Hanzhang Palace will be closed for a long time.

427
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
So I want to come over

428
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
and see if there's anything

429
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
that needs to be done.

430
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
I'm sorry.

432
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
I'm sorry.

433
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm sorry.

434
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
I'm sorry.

435
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
I'm sorry.

436
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
I'm sorry.

437
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
I'm sorry.

438
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
I want to see

439
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
if there's anything

440
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
that needs to be done.

441
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Thank you, Minister Zang.

442
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
But the emperor has ordered

443
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
that the Hanzhang Palace

444
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
should not be closed for a long time.

445
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
There's no need to go inside.

446
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Please go back.

447
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
You're back.

448
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
What's wrong?

449
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Why are you sweating so much?

450
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
What happened?

451
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
What's wrong with you?

452
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
I know where the ghost is.

453
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
I know where the ghost is.

454
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
I know where the ghost is.

455
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
I know where the ghost is.

456
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
I know where the ghost is.

457
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
Where is it?

458
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
In the palace.

459
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
In the Hanzhang Palace of the emperor.

460
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Hanzhang Palace?

461
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,640
So your father was...

462
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
I was thinking on the way back.

463
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
The most secret place in the five days

464
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
is the palace.

465
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
The palace is the emperor's

466
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
plan of the dragon tower.

467
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
So you said

468
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
the emperor didn't know

469
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
for so many years?

470
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
If I had to say

471
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
the other places in the palace,

472
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
I would believe

473
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
that your father secretly hid them.

474
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
But it's the Hanzhang Palace.

475
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
The emperor stays there every day.

476
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
So you said

477
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
the ghost I dug

478
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
was not a coincidence.

479
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,640
If your father built the fan base,

480
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
he gave the emperor's decree

481
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
to find the ghost.

482
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
But why didn't your father

483
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
give it to the same doctor?

484
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
According to the queen's order,

485
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
the emperor's order

486
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
was to find the ghost.

487
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
But why didn't your father

488
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
give it to the same doctor?

489
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
According to the queen's order,

490
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
the same fish is

491
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
the key to the ghost's wash.

492
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
I don't understand that.

493
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Could it be that the emperor...

494
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
No,

495
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
the emperor is not the third person.

496
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Otherwise, he would never allow

497
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
the emperor and Cao Jingxian

498
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
to have the same fish.

499
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Besides,

500
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
if the emperor wanted to kill my father,

501
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
he could kill him

502
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
and kill me.

503
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,640
The ghost was in the emperor's hands.

504
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
It was in your enemy's hands.

505
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
What happened that day?

506
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
Except for the emperor and your father,

507
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
I'm afraid there's no one else.

508
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,860
Shangjue,

509
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
take your correlationience

510
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,640
and save the people.

511
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
We'll keep our friendship

512
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
between you and me.

513
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Yifeng,

514
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
speak.

515
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
We must disperse the emperor

516
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
for now.

517
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Let's make it another day.

518
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,320
What does he want?

519
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,240
The star is indeed suspicious.

520
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,520
He's looking for something.

521
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,600
In the end,

522
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,920
he's been living outside the Hall of the Han Sect for a long time.

523
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
The Hall of the Han Sect?

524
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,600
Yes.

525
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,200
Then,

526
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,480
he'll go back.

527
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,280
It's true.

528
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,760
It's true.

529
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,200
What a joke.

530
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,120
All these years,

531
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,560
I've been living in the Hall of the Han Sect for so many times.

532
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:30,560
The wind blows, the wind blows.

533
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,720
The Green Sky Sword has already set a place in the East Forest Mountain.

534
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,360
It will be a few days before the cold.

535
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,360
It will send the jade talisman to the Palace.

536
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,120
I'll do everything in my power.

537
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Don't worry, Your Highness.

538
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,000
I believe you won't make any mistakes.

539
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,000
Lord Zang,

540
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,960
please show me the Green Sky Sword.

541
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,880
Of course.

542
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,560
It's my honor.

543
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,240
Your Highness, please.

544
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,640
The Green Sky Sword has Tianwen,

545
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,640
Lu Ke,

546
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,560
Shen Mu,

547
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,560
Xiang Duo,

548
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,880
and the Five Divisions of the Gold.

549
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,840
They are all different.

550
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,840
The Star is a close-up,

551
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,320
and the newspaper is a newspaper.

552
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,840
The silver, the sword,

553
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,560
and the Tibetan sword are all designed.

554
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,000
What about your father?

555
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,800
What does he know the best?

556
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,600
As the Green Sky Sword,

557
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
he must be very careful.

558
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,680
He always has the latest.

559
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,880
If you really want to say that,

560
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,240
he likes to be the mother of the Palace.

561
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,920
Your Highness, please.

562
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,800
Your Highness,

563
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,600
he often

564
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,560
takes care of the house here.

565
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,640
How many years has he been here?

566
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,920
Twenty years.

567
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,960
If he hadn't been to Dongxiang,

568
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,840
he should be here now.

569
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,120
If he stayed in Dongxiang,

570
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,540
maybe your family

571
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,560
will live still.

572
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,680
It's an pity

573
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,960
that the Korean Council

574
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,400
is so haggard

575
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,400
But unfortunately, I didn't get the fruit.

576
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Your Highness.

577
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
The fruit is not the fruit.

578
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
People come and go.

579
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
For decades,

580
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
they will get a lot.

581
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
They will lose a lot.

582
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
People who leave

583
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
will never find them again.

584
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Remember,

585
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
the most important thing

586
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
is to cherish the people you love.

587
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
They'd rather sacrifice their lives

588
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
than protect their lives.

589
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
You'd rather lose your lives

590
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
than avenge them.

591
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Right?

592
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
People know that

593
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
they can only be fooled by fate.

594
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
My father didn't make the choice.

595
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
I agree.

596
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Let's go.

597
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Let's talk somewhere else.

598
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
You just said

599
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
your father didn't make the choice.

600
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
It seems

601
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
you already know where Gui Xi is.

602
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Gui Xi

603
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
is in the palace,

604
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
in the Hanzhang Hall.

605
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Hurry up.

606
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Is this what you said?

607
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
I don't know.

608
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
I don't know.

609
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Is this what you said?

610
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Yes.

611
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Except for the Emperor,

612
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
who else

613
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
can make your father

614
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
be so filial?

615
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
The head of the country

616
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
would be so magical

617
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
that he can't bear to

618
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
beg for mercy.

619
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
So your father

620
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
would be so stubborn

621
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
to take away Gui Xi

622
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
for His Majesty.

623
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
The Emperor

624
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
would know

625
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
he was killed.

626
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
No.

627
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
My father was so hard-working

628
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
that he would give

629
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Gui Xi to His Majesty.

630
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
But he didn't

631
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
give him away with the same illness.

632
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
This

633
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
is the cause of his illness.

634
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
It's a good idea.

635
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
In your eyes,

636
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
what is the Emperor?

637
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
It's Heaven.

638
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
It's Jun.

639
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
It's also my father.

640
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
What's next?

641
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
I want to take away Gui Xi

642
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
and use her

643
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
to lure the third person.

644
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
In the Emperor's eyes,

645
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
you're so bold.

646
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Even if you can get into the palace,

647
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
can you enter the

648
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
Han Zhang Hall

649
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
that is the first to be built?

650
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
I need Your Highness

651
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
to help me.

652
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Han Zhang Hall?

653
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,400
The Emperor?

654
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Then what are you going to do

655
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
with the Emperor?

656
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Shut up.

657
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Let me tell you.

658
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
He said

659
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
he was crazy.

660
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
He said he wanted to

661
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
steal Gui Xi from Han Zhang Hall.

662
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
I can only find the third person

663
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
through Gui Xi.

664
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
I have no other choice.

665
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
You're all crazy.

666
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
The Queen of East and West

667
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
is also very suspicious.

668
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
She's not only stopping you,

669
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
but also

670
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
pushing you out to die.

671
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
The Emperor

672
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
is also so bold.

673
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
You're all crazy.

674
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Master,

675
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
I really have no other choice.

676
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
This is...

677
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
This is a small thing.

678
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
A small thing.

679
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Many people will be implicated

680
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
and even lost their lives.

681
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Zeng Hai,

682
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
are you sure you want to do this?

683
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
I only found the third person

684
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
in the palace.

685
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
Master,

686
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
if you were to choose to stop,

687
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
now,

688
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Gui Xi is in the hands of the Emperor.

689
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
If you lose him,

690
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
you'll be in danger.

691
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
You'll have to

692
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
fight with the world

693
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
and your personal family.

694
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
You'll have to choose.

695
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
With my Gui Xi,

696
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
I'll take the third person

697
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
and kill him

698
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
after the revenge.

699
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I'll make sure

700
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
His Majesty will know everything.

701
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
If His Majesty blames me,

702
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I'll bear the burden alone.

703
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I'll let anyone

704
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
take the blame.

705
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I'll let anyone take the blame.

706
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
I've chosen

707
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,400
to stop

708
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,400
from the last ten years.

709
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
I've never thought

710
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
I can give up my life.

711
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Zeng Hai,

712
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
it seems that

713
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
you already have a solution.

714
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
In that case,

715
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
I'll do my best.

716
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
I'll do my best.

717
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
I'm a sacrifice

718
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,400
for my life.

719
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
I'm a sacrifice for my life.

720
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
I'm a sacrifice for my life.

721
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
I'm a sacrifice for my life.

722
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
I'm a sacrifice for my life.

723
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
I'm a sacrifice for my life.

724
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,400
I'm a sacrifice for my life.

725
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,400
I'm a sacrifice.
