00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

2
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,400
Su Yan.

3
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,720
Do you think your brother will betray me?

4
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,800
He won't.

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,720
Look.

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Is this his handwriting?

7
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,480
With the ability of the rear-wheel,

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,920
I've already surrendered and asked for information.

9
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,480
If I die,

10
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,880
I can't trust him.

11
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,240
Yes.

12
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,920
Lu Jin went to investigate the funeral.

13
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,360
He found out about Zhuang Lu Yin.

14
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,200
He pretended to surrender to Zhuang Lu Yin,

15
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,760
but he was killed.

16
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,720
And this matter

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,440
is related to that thing.

18
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,960
Zhuang Lu Yin.

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,440
What did you find out behind my back?

20
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,720
You'd rather kill Lu Jin

21
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,000
than tell me the secret.

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,240
Lu Yan.

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,840
Hide Lu Jin well.

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,680
Yes.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,760
And.

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,960
Call your brother here.

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,960
What did Cao Jing Xian do today?

28
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,480
Eunuch Cao came to see the Marquis.

29
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,680
He said that Lord Lu entered the Marquis' mansion last night.

30
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,560
But later, someone came to inform that

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,720
Lord Lu died in Guangji River.

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,680
There might be some hidden story in the middle.

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,880
But I haven't figured it out yet.

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,040
Lu Jin's death

35
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,560
is not as simple as Cao Jing Xian's

36
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,400
search for enemies.

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,720
I'm just guessing.

38
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,400
Please don't blame me.

39
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,440
Eunuch Cao's Commandant's Office

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,840
is secretly monitoring

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,920
the officials in the capital.

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,400
He has no grudges against the Marquis.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,000
Why did he

44
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,560
put his eyes on the Marquis these days?

45
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,520
Did something big happen recently?

46
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,880
Or did anything change in the Marquis' mansion

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,800
that caused his attention and suspicion?

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,680
What do you think the reason is?

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,880
I came to the capital

50
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,800
and I don't know much about many things.

51
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,720
I don't know enough about Eunuch Cao.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
But he didn't wait for the Marquis

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,560
and took me away today.

54
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,680
It seems that

55
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,360
he has already targeted me.

56
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
As for the reasons,

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,040
I dare not guess.

58
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm a little pasty with him.

59
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,600
We've been safe and sound these years.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,200
But now he has no reason to be troubled.

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,320
I think he's very jealous

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,640
that I have such a talented staff like you.

63
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,120
But Marquis,

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,680
will Eunuch Cao

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,920
really be angry with you

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,400
for my ability?

67
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,440
Enough.

68
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,720
I'll think about it.

69
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,200
You can leave now.

70
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,480
Marquis,

71
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,640
can you arrange some guards

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,840
to protect you?

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,760
I've been against Eunuch Cao today.

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,160
If no one guards you,

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,640
I'm afraid there will be danger.

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,360
If Eunuch Cao really wants to kill you,

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
it's useless for me to give you more guards.

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,320
But I have a way to keep you safe.

79
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,800
Let's put it this way.

80
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,360
I'll give you a government official position.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,920
As long as you can show your face in front of His Majesty,

82
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,960
he won't be so easy to move.

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,000
I just want to stay by the Marquis' side

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,960
and serve him.

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,920
I've never thought of leaving the Marquis' mansion.

86
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Don't worry.

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,960
Even if you become an official,

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,760
you're still my man.

89
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,360
Thank you for your kindness,

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,160
Marquis.

91
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,840
Here, uncle.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,640
A toast to you.

93
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,400
Ping Ji He wants to give you a promotion?

94
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,920
How many titles does he have?

95
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,160
How many phoenixes does he have?

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,080
He has no one of the eight.

97
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
And I think his attitude

98
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,760
is to make me a

99
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,440
just-elected official.

100
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,400
But I want to be in the Qingtian Realm.

101
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,560
You want to be like Chu Huai Ming?

102
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,840
Chu Huai Ming is a man of good character.

103
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,200
He's a man of good fortune.

104
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,480
Now the Qingtian Realm is in his hands.

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
It's a mess.

106
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,960
I can't let him

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
ruin his father's hard work.

108
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,520
There's another reason.

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,680
After I entered the Marquis' mansion,

110
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,640
all the things that Ping Ji He asked me to do

111
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,080
seemed to be looking for something secretive.

112
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,960
It seems that he still hasn't given up on that thing.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,520
He chose you

114
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
because you know how to watch fish.

115
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,760
He thinks you can help him find it.

116
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,920
So I'm going to the Qingtian Realm.

117
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,480
Chu Huai Ming hasn't been able to find it

118
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,480
for so many years.

119
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,560
At least I want to make Marquis Ping Ji He feel

120
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,640
that I can.

121
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,760
This is my MOR.

122
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,240
Your ALS has been broken.

123
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,920
I have no idea where you got this.

124
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,800
I made it myself.

125
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,680
I have a bad lucky year.

126
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,920
I didn't have a chance to win.

127
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,000
Lord Zang has 1974 futureILL emotions and heart.

128
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,480
His painting are well widely praised.

129
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,680
You made such a Mediator painting.

130
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
The acupoint is carved well

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,560
Did Cao Qingshan see through Lu Jin's death?

132
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,720
Look, he only cares about Marquis

133
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,640
He refuses to take action

134
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,920
His enough can help

135
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,360
Now you are so bold

136
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,680
Did you have a feeling

137
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,800
We are the same kind of people

138
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,680
So you should pay the debt

139
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,720
Of course

140
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,480
I will listen to you

141
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,240
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival in a few days

142
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,280
Do you have an appointment?

143
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,480
Go out with me

144
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,360
Mid-Autumn Festival

145
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,720
Are you afraid of ghosts?

146
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,600
Not really

147
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,080
But I'm afraid

148
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,040
it's not enough to repay you

149
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,280
for your kindness

150
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,640
It's ok

151
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
The kindness is different from the money

152
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,040
The less money you pay,

153
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,800
the more kindness you get

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,720
You will owe me more in the future

155
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,120
Ok

156
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,240
I will do as you say

157
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,340
My lord

158
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,880
Lord

159
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,480
How are you?

160
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,760
Well

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,320
I am asked by your father

162
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,440
Can I ask for a favor?

163
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Not necessary

164
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,800
Young Mr. Xu

165
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,120
Just ask

166
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,520
Jesus

167
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,400
How I feel

168
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,680
is it possible?

169
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
I have dark 웃

170
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,760
Just ask

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,920
Are you small?

172
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,560
Young Master

173
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
You look good

174
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,520
With such big present

175
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,380
Marquis,

176
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,900
nonprofit restaurants are wah Kindergarten.

177
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,620
And some of it is unusual.

178
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,440
What I am good at is 파legia.

179
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:10,320
It leas

180
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,580
당당당 moist

181
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,200
Lai Zi, have you seen enough? Hurry and come up.

182
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Sit.

183
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,800
You dressed up quite well.

184
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,800
Tonight is July 30th. It's your holiday.

185
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,600
My holiday? I'm not dead.

186
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,400
Why is it my holiday?

187
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,200
A poor ghost is also a ghost.

188
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,000
What about Boss Xiang?

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,800
Me? I'm also a ghost.

190
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,800
Boss Xiang is sitting in the Yongzheng Building. Every day, there are so many people accompanying you.

191
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,000
You'll feel lonely.

192
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,600
Do you know why I called him Zhen Lou?

193
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
He's tall and has no worries.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Smart.

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,600
In the end, everyone else has no worries.

196
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm left with all the worries.

197
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,800
But your Zhen Lou has made many people in the capital have a place to hide.

198
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Zhen Lou is still too small.

199
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,400
If there are a thousand or ten thousand,

200
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,200
maybe all the homeless can be allowed to return to their homes.

201
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,600
Miss Xiang is right.

202
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Why did you suddenly call me Miss Xiang?

203
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,600
Don't you usually call me Boss Xiang?

204
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,800
Because I think tonight's Miss Xiang is different from Boss Xiang who is usually Zhen Lou.

205
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Whatever, Mr. Zang.

206
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,600
Is she beautiful?

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,800
Beautiful.

208
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Is she beautiful or am I beautiful?

209
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,200
Of course, Miss Xiang is more beautiful.

210
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,600
Then where am I beautiful?

211
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm beautiful.

212
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
Where am I beautiful?

213
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,200
Miss Xiang is beautiful and has a beautiful eyes.

214
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,600
This is not something a normal woman can compare to you.

215
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,800
Then let me ask you.

216
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,600
Do you want to see me often?

217
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
You can't answer me?

218
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Miss Xiang, are you sure you want to see me often?

219
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,600
It's not good to just see each other.

220
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Who said it's not good? I think it's very interesting.

221
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
Isn't it?

222
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,000
I didn't expect there are so many lanterns here.

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I let Zhen Lou release ten thousand lanterns tonight.

224
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm not sure.

225
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,400
Are you thinking that Miss Xiang has ten thousand relatives?

226
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,600
How could I think that?

227
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,000
But why did you release so many lanterns?

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,600
Is there anything you want to rely on?

229
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Because I have money.

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,400
It looks like you have money.

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,800
I heard that if you write your family name on the lantern,

232
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
you can pass on your private life to them.

233
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
Then you can write it too.

234
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,000
I heard that your parents and relatives are gone.

235
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,400
What?

236
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,600
Shoot up!"

237
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Shoot up!

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,600
Shoot up!

239
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,040
There's no time toddle when they are still at the party!

240
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,600
I don't even want to stand in the chat room when they betray me.

241
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,800
No idea.

242
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,920
Mother...

243
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,760
Are you happy now?

244
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,240
Nothing.

245
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,240
It's quiet here.

246
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,800
That's right.

247
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,160
I like quiet and wide places.

248
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,120
Lie down.

249
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,560
Why are you so quiet?

250
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,040
Is this chair comfortable?

251
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,520
Very comfortable.

252
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,520
Yes.

253
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,200
Zang Han, you're so good at fishing.

254
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you recognize the stars in the sky?

255
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,840
Look.

256
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,960
There are 28 starry stars in the sky.

257
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,720
There are seven eastern stars,

258
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,760
and four starry stars.

259
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,040
The other three stars are white tiger,

260
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,720
pig, and black tiger.

261
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,480
Look.

262
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,680
Look at those stars.

263
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,480
Which ones?

264
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,760
Those stars.

265
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,320
Do they look like a small mouth?

266
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,440
Small mouth?

267
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,480
No.

268
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,080
A little bit.

269
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,440
But the four stars you mentioned

270
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,800
are called chicken stars.

271
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,320
The tail is next to it.

272
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,880
They are the dragon tail of the seven dragon stars.

273
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,720
I don't think they look like dragon tail.

274
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,760
Look at those stars.

275
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,760
Which ones?

276
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,880
Do they look like a jewel on the neck?

277
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,520
Why are you laughing?

278
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,400
They don't look like that.

279
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,320
They do.

280
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,080
Miss Xiang is right.

281
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,640
The stars you mentioned are called jade stars.

282
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,000
They are really the symbol of jewel beauty.

283
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,960
Really?

284
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
I can see stars, too.

285
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,520
I find them more interesting than you.

286
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,600
But look.

287
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,640
There is an owner of this jewel.

288
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,360
She is a woman with a crying face.

289
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,560
A woman?

290
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Although the beauty is in the jewel,

291
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,080
the stars in the sky are her tears.

292
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,200
Tears?

293
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,840
Then why did she cry?

294
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,080
She should be a woman who was married away.

295
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,720
She is unhappy all her life.

296
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,480
She is waiting in the foreign land.

297
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,560
She has waited for her whole life.

298
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,640
No one takes her home.

299
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,280
Then her family must miss her.

300
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,040
I don't know.

301
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,520
Maybe she is crying.

302
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
So she doesn't want to go home.

303
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,760
I didn't expect you can make up stories.

304
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,360
You didn't make the script, right?

305
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,000
You are the most talented person in the world.

306
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,280
I don't know.

307
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,300
Maybe you know?

308
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,540
Maybe you are in love.

309
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,940
You are a person equipped with no karma.

310
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,840
But you quite look so rash.

311
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,480
Everybody knows that.

312
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,280
You surely have an idea seem like it.

313
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,880
If the target is not with her,

314
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,460
she will stay in the dark in evesitoot.

315
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,220
As long as she tries,

316
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,000
I have something to say.

317
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,860
You're rằngish.

318
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Look, this dog has a heart.

319
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,480
But his heart is like a fan.

320
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
That's because...

321
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Because the dog cried.

322
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
He couldn't find his family.

323
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,480
So his tears are in his heart.

324
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
You are good at making up stories.

325
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I admit.

326
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
But you are not good at making up stories.

327
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
You are not good at making up stories.

328
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
You are not good at making up stories.

329
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,480
You are not good at making up stories.

330
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
You are not good at making up stories.

331
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
You are not good at making up stories.

332
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
You are not good at making up stories.

333
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,480
You are not good at making up stories.

334
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
You are not good at making up stories.

335
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
You are not good at making up stories.

336
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
You are not good at making up stories.

337
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
You are not good at making up stories.

338
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
You are not good at making up stories.

339
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
You are not good at making up stories.

340
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Suddenly I look back.

341
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,480
I lost my loved one.

342
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,480
We are separated by the world.

343
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,480
I don't want to say goodbye.

344
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,480
The moonlight holds me tight.

345
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
You said there are many stars.

346
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Or you owe me more money.

347
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
I owe you so much.

348
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,480
How much did you pay today?

349
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Today you are on my boat.

350
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
You are drinking my wine.

351
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Shouldn't you owe me more?

352
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
It makes sense.

353
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
I owe you so much.

354
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
I owe you so much.

355
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
I owe you so much.

356
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
I owe you so much.

357
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
I owe you so much.

358
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
I owe you so much.

359
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
I owe you so much.

360
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
I owe you so much.

361
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
I owe you so much.

362
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
I owe you so much.

363
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
I owe you so much.

364
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
I owe you so much.

365
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
I owe you so much.

366
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
I owe you so much.

367
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
I owe you so much.

368
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
I owe you so much.

369
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
I owe you so much.

370
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
I owe you so much.

371
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
I owe you so much.

372
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
I owe you so much.

373
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
I owe you so much.

374
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
I owe you so much.

375
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
I owe you so much.

376
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
I owe you so much.

377
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
I owe you so much.

378
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
I owe you so much.

379
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I owe you so much.

380
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
I owe you so much.

381
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,160
Mo horizontally.

382
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Yan horizontally.

383
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,200
Tang horizontally.

384
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,400
response to the name Chang horizontally.

385
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,200
both ПрOn milestone and speed up.

386
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
a beautiful landscape ten thousand years ago.

387
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,040
You can see,

388
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,680
and dropped quite heavy about their main child,

389
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:12,920
then

390
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,720
leading to a願雨

391
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,960
The iron cru???

392
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,160
When Centre www was held,

393
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:22,840
it immediately

394
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,440
r lack of fish

395
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,400
Raise the starfish

396
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,960
When玉 떠�殺魚

397
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,600
Round-up

398
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,640
If that fish takes the baits,

399
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,200
the tightening of theoss is needed

400
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,320
Although the flood is severe,

401
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,600
the court has been holding the disaster relief.

402
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
The damage is much less than before.

403
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,800
My lord,

404
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,480
the situation in Guwu is good.

405
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,120
The rewards of Jiangnan Shui Dao are better than before.

406
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,440
Except for the drought in Zhongzhou,

407
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,320
it's a case of nature.

408
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,080
If I announce the prediction of the drought in Zhongzhou,

409
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
there will be a relief.

410
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,880
His majesty will be very happy.

411
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,960
Qingtianjian will be rewarded

412
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,800
with a good news.

413
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,840
Thank you, my lord.

414
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,560
Thank you, my lord.

415
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,760
Rain, rain, rain, rain.

416
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,000
The rainstorm in Rui Tu yesterday

417
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,480
is indeed a big disaster.

418
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,520
It's been raining for a long time in Zhongzhou.

419
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,760
It's finally going to rain.

420
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,040
My house is over there.

421
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,960
My family has finally been saved.

422
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,800
It's a big disaster.

423
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,880
It's a big disaster.

424
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,040
My lord,

425
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,280
you are from Zhongzhou.

426
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,000
How is your situation over there?

427
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,880
It's raining heavily in Zhongzhou.

428
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,040
There are still bright shadows

429
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,480
around the sun these days.

430
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,800
It's very scary.

431
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,200
Finally, it rains.

432
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,800
Yes.

433
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,240
My lord, have you ever heard

434
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,200
that Qingtianjian is going to be a big disaster today?

435
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,280
I heard that

436
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,960
the report of Qingtianjian

437
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,440
will be sent to the dry forest in Zhongzhou soon.

438
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,800
It will relieve the suffering of the drought.

439
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,720
It seems that the clouds of the sun yesterday

440
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,880
are indeed very strong.

441
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,160
Zang Hai,

442
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,040
your ability to observe the sky

443
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,600
is not as good as others.

444
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,440
I dare not

445
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
compare it with your opinion.

446
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,760
But I have a doubt in my heart

447
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,280
and want to report to you.

448
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,040
Say it.

449
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,880
Say it.

450
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
I'm afraid that you are wrong this time.

451
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
Although it will rain in Zhongzhou,

452
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,200
it's not a sudden rain,

453
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,720
but a fierce rain.

454
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
Why do you say that?

455
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,560
I watched the stars last night.

456
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,480
I did see the rain

457
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,720
in Zhongzhou.

458
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,880
But it's hard to come

459
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
and hard to go.

460
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,520
I heard the people talking about it

461
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,840
on the street today.

462
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,800
These days,

463
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,800
there have been

464
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
continuous sunflowers in Zhongzhou.

465
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,240
Sunflowers are in full bloom.

466
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,680
I'm afraid that the rain will continue

467
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,880
and eventually destroy the dam.

468
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
A large number of people

469
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,160
will be lost.

470
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,920
But yesterday was clearly a battle of the sunflowers.

471
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,280
The clouds and the sunflowers are all in the river.

472
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,960
It's just a coincidence.

473
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,560
I can't accurately judge the situation.

474
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,440
Are you sure?

475
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,520
I'm willing to risk my life to guarantee it.

476
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,760
I hope you can report to His Majesty as soon as possible

477
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,880
and disperse the public

478
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,040
and get rid of the dam

479
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,520
to deal with the coming flood.

480
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,720
Have you ever mentioned

481
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,400
your speculation to others?

482
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,920
Then you pretend that you never know.

483
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,320
I pretend that I never heard it.

484
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,120
My Lord, this...

485
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,320
His Majesty is happy right now.

486
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,880
I don't want to show my face.

487
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,640
If I report to His Majesty

488
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,560
based on your speculation,

489
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,840
what if you're wrong?

490
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,640
I'll be

491
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,440
making a fool of myself.

492
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,480
Even if there are

493
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,640
disaster and injury in Zhongzhou,

494
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,280
it has nothing to do with me.

495
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Then the people of Zhongzhou...

496
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,120
It's their life.

497
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,840
Don't mention it again.

498
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Think about it.

499
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,720
Don't mention it again.

500
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,960
You may leave.

501
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,000
Yes.

502
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,920
The reason why you're so absent-minded

503
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,920
is because Zhongzhou

504
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,520
is the place where General Fu Zhisong

505
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
is stationed.

506
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,360
If it's as you expected,

507
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,720
if the defense is not good,

508
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm afraid that

509
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,960
General Fu Zhisong

510
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,600
will go to fight for it.

511
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,120
If he wants to fight for it,

512
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,920
it will only be hard

513
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,120
for the people of Zhongzhou.

514
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,280
When the rain water

515
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,480
rushes back to the dam,

516
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,520
how many people will leave

517
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,720
and leave?

518
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,080
Even if there's a big flood,

519
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,880
it may not

520
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,120
rush back to the dam.

521
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,800
I've checked the

522
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,520
previous records.

523
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,440
Guess who

524
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,040
is protecting the dam?

525
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,000
Zhuang Zhifu.

526
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,840
Exactly.

527
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,640
With his greed,

528
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,040
I don't know how many

529
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,280
people are in the dam

530
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
and the end of it.

531
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,680
Many are.)

532
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,960
There'll be less rain right after Zhongzhou.

533
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,640
Not much wisdom

534
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,360
can be seen from a secret.

535
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,680
Before it's raining,

536
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,500
the Korean court already

537
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,600
has lost with Fantasie,

538
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,840
the quagmire has manged to meet.

539
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,280
The harming version

540
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,560
is not often we hear this.

541
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,120
A while ago,

542
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,280
I also told you

543
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
I would

544
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,200
bring Baiming down

545
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,520
until I had further chance.

546
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,440
But this time it is

547
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,520
his own hat-trick.

548
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:49,280
I can only�트 that

549
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,160
Thanks

550
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,540
We have to revive the Hive

551
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:17,760
The constant

552
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,380
Soldiers should know the truth

553
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,020
can confuse people.

554
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,020
Do you understand?

555
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,860
Yes.

556
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,580
Then we'll

557
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,820
use the way of others

558
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,980
to complete the body of others.

559
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
Excuse me.

560
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,660
Let me see.

561
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,700
What does it say?

562
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,380
The Great Wall of China

563
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,460
is the sign of the great opportunity.

564
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,180
Great opportunity.

565
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,660
Great. Great.

566
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,620
It's finally going to rain.

567
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,260
Our Zhuang family in Zhongzhou is saved.

568
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,220
That's not necessarily.

569
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,660
Who? Who?

570
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,140
Where did you come from?

571
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,180
How dare you question the Qingtian Sword?

572
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,420
Let me tell you.

573
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,140
The Qingtian Sword is the witness of Chu Huai Ming.

574
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,300
He knows the truth.

575
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,380
He said the Great Wall of China is the sign of the great opportunity.

576
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,580
He must be right.

577
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,580
Yes.

578
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,180
Right?

579
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,860
Yes.

580
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
The world is in chaos.

581
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,700
But the changes in the flag are well-known.

582
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,580
Chu Huai Ming was in a hurry to meet the demon.

583
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,860
He didn't find out the truth.

584
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,100
So he made a decision.

585
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,460
This time, he made a big mistake.

586
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,660
The heavy rain in Zhongzhou

587
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,540
is not the rain to save people.

588
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,300
It's the rain to kill people.

589
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,820
How could it be the rain to kill people?

590
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,500
Yes.

591
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,780
It's so scary to kill people in the rain.

592
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,300
I...

593
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,020
I'll kill you.

594
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,940
Stop.

595
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,860
No. No.

596
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,500
Stop.

597
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,300
No. No.

598
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,140
Don't talk nonsense.

599
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,220
I tell you.

600
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,820
I saw it with my own eyes.

601
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
The weather was very special a few days ago.

602
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,900
It was the god's sign.

603
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,300
It must be the rain.

604
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,180
Yes.

605
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,820
The weather is indeed rare.

606
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,300
But Chu Huai Ming was wrong.

607
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,740
Something bad is going to happen in Zhongzhou.

608
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,020
You...

609
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,060
Why do you say that?

610
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,020
I read the sky and the sun.

611
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,420
I read the stars and the moon.

612
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,900
It's not a big deal.

613
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,380
It's a big deal.

614
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,660
A big deal?

615
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,740
I'm afraid there will be a big flood in Zhongzhou.

616
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,900
Well...

617
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,300
You...

618
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,060
You said these.

619
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,300
We don't understand.

620
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,540
What's the white and red and the moon?

621
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,220
You're from Zhongzhou, right?

622
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,260
Did you see the black shadow

623
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,700
on the sun?

624
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,580
Yes.

625
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,180
It's the sun's ring.

626
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,300
It's the rain's sign.

627
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,180
But now the summer and autumn are in full swing.

628
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,100
The white tiger in the west is in full swing.

629
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,860
The sign is the rain's sign.

630
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,060
Fellow citizens.

631
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,060
I'm afraid it's going to rain for days.

632
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,500
Sir.

633
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,500
Are you serious?

634
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,460
Has this ever happened before?

635
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,580
In the past, the horse entered the west gate.

636
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,260
Kong Ming broke the guard.

637
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,140
Everyone was concerned.

638
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,700
When he saw the star, the moon, the sun, and the moon,

639
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,100
there must be a big rain in the moon.

640
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,300
It makes sense.

641
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,060
Zhongzhou is a place where rain doesn't stop.

642
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
The water is not wet.

643
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,940
If the rain doesn't stop,

644
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,860
it will definitely flood.

645
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,940
If the flood is big,

646
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,260
people will only be left behind.

647
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,020
The cold weather will not be gone.

648
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,700
Chu Huai Ming can sit on the throne of the Qingtian Sword.

649
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,580
He relies on the false and false.

650
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,900
He has no real ability.

651
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,700
If you don't believe me,

652
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,580
just pass on what I just said.

653
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,300
One word can be true.

654
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,420
Wait for a few days.

655
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,300
Let's see if Chu Huai Ming is right or I'm right.

656
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,900
Who is right?

657
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,100
I don't know him.

658
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,300
Sir.

659
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,900
Sir.

660
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,700
If you say so,

661
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,020
I will be in trouble.

662
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,700
Sir, please get up.

663
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,060
Sir, believe me.

664
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,580
Pass on what I just said

665
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,060
to your family in Zhongzhou.

666
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,540
Tell them to get ready.

667
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,140
Okay.

668
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,700
Go.

669
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:23,860
Sir.

670
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,980
No, Gao Ran.

671
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,020
Who are you?

672
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,940
I'm the first staff of the Marquis of Pingjing.

673
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,020
Zang Hai.

674
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,820
Zang Hai.

675
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,380
Zang Hai.

676
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,460
Zang Hai.

677
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,860
I know him.

678
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,180
He is the one who built the Imperial Tomb.

679
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,180
Okay.

680
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,220
I heard about it too.

681
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,100
At that time,

682
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,020
the Marquis of Pingjing respected him very much.

683
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,340
The one he trusted

684
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,980
must be a great talent.

685
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,100
Pass on the news.

686
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,820
Pass it on.

687
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,860
Pass it on.

688
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,980
Zang Hai is really generous.

689
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,460
He said I was mistaken.

690
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,460
Yes.

691
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,340
Nonsense.

692
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,580
What does Zang Hai mean?

693
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,940
What does he know?

694
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,660
What else did he say?

695
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,540
Zang Hai said

696
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,980
the day of the White-Red Temple

697
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,780
is coming.

698
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,340
He said

699
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,060
there must be a flood in Zhongzhou.

700
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,500
Let's see what will happen

701
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,180
in the near future.

702
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,460
What is this nonsense?

703
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,780
The Marquis knows about this?

704
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,460
I'm afraid he knows it now.

705
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,100
I can make the light of the candle

706
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,660
shine.

707
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,020
I can also make it

708
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,340
shatter.

709
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,180
I told you to shut up.

710
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,380
You went to the Qingtian Sword

711
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,700
and made a great speech.

712
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,660
You said you saw the world of the great bear.

713
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,740
Now it's all over the city.

714
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,140
You insist on opposing me.

715
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,060
Marquis.

716
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,660
I dare not.

717
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,260
I just want to do my best

718
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,940
to make this matter go smoothly.

719
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,420
Marquis.

720
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,420
I'm sorry.

721
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,140
Marquis.

722
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,380
I

723
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,660
want to work for you.

724
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,060
But I was in a hurry

725
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,500
and stretched my hand

726
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,860
to the place where it was broken.

727
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,260
He didn't insist on opposing me.

728
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,260
He just read a few books

729
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,580
and thought he would see the world.

730
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,180
Zang Hai.

731
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,460
Marquis trusts you so much.

732
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,900
But you are so reckless.

733
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,700
Why don't you

734
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,540
think for him?

735
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,980
Marquis.

736
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,340
I made this decision

737
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,540
for you.

738
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,940
Tell me.

739
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,060
How did you think for me?

740
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,260
I asked you

741
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,780
to report my judgment

742
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,940
to His Majesty.

743
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,260
I didn't think it through.

744
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,700
Marquis is in a high position.

745
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,220
You shouldn't have done this.

746
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,860
I have to

747
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,580
tell the people

748
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
that you are the one

749
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,100
recommended by Marquis.

750
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,220
He is wrong.

751
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,980
He might take the paper

752
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,180
of the one he likes.

753
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,260
I'm a member of Marquis.

754
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,940
I made a contribution.

755
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,660
It's his contribution.

756
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,660
But if you are wrong,

757
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,980
it's my fault.

758
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,700
You are just my assistant.

759
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,900
How can I make a contribution?

760
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,980
It's not your turn to make a decision.

761
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,980
I have another idea.

762
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,660
Marquis.

763
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,260
I've heard it before.

764
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,580
Please let me finish.

765
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,940
Go ahead.

766
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,060
But think it through.

767
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,060
It might be your last time to tell me.

768
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,740
I didn't dare to tell you before.

769
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,900
What I said

770
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,060
is not only a big deal,

771
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,260
but also

772
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,420
giving you one.

773
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,620
I'll be like a waning 46 Feelings

774
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,420
and Death to all ones there.

775
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,060
I'll be like

776
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,900
Too many loneliness

777
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,140
to let you go.

778
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,300
I reservoir all of my emotions

779
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
If it's

780
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,100
light or the darkness

781
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,500
inside one,

782
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,220
and green or white,

783
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,820
I will never lie to the Marquis.

784
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,780
I…

785
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,100
I…

786
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,380
I'm ready for it.

787
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,780
Kid.

788
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,660
I haven't wanted to街

789
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,080
to serve my Marquis,

790
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,420
I want my children to study inupp aja busんな.

791
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,180
Don't wail around.

792
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,260
Don't say just because it's just a joke.

793
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,340
That's just a joke,

794
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,340
not a shame.

795
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,500
No.

796
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,780
I just want to

797
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,900
summon the Disk.

798
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,140
The things you taught me

799
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,300
has been turned out ugly.

800
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,900
I'm going to pass out.

801
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,300
I can't really tell.

802
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,700
I can't really understand.

803
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,300
Even if it's really on you,

804
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,500
it will cause you to die.

805
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,900
Please spare my life.

806
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,500
I can solve the crisis.

807
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,700
I'm sorry.

808
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
I'm sorry.

809
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,700
I'm sorry.

810
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
I'm sorry.

811
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
I'm sorry.

812
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,540
I can't bring myself to say

813
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,220
that you had saved my life.

814
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,940
I'm sorry.

815
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,380
Nine days ago,

816
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,100
at least

817
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,100
at the banquet,

818
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,220
my house

819
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,700
was surrounded by the imperial guards.

820
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,280
I took a twists

821
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,300
and turned around

822
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
to ask for forgiveness.

823
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,500
within seven days

824
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,460
If in seven days

825
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,220
the rain in Zhongzhou

826
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,620
is as you said

827
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,820
please wait patiently

828
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Yinzhao

829
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Li Qi

830
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Yin Zhener

831
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Yin Zhener

832
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Yin Zhener

833
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,500
Yin Zhener

834
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Yin Zhener

835
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,900
Even if the knife is sharp

836
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,700
it's not black

837
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,700
It's just because

838
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,500
my heart is burning

839
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,500
The rain is me

840
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,300
The rain is me

841
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,100
The will to give up

842
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:46,100
I will always be remembered

843
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,700
The life is me

844
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,300
The rain is me

845
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,900
When the sun rises like a sunset

846
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,500
With the military song

847
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,900
In the dream is me

848
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,500
The hand is me

849
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,900
The world is me

850
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,700
The world is me

851
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,100
You are me
