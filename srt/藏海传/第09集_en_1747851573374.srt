00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,840
penal

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It must be hard for a man who left the imperial mausoleum alone

5
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You are so lucky

6
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to have a man with the talent of the imperial family

7
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You flatter me

8
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I have only been a member of the imperial family for a few days

9
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I am not good at being spoiled and spoiled

10
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Please be frank with me

11
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay

12
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I will be frank with you

13
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
My name is Xiang An Tu

14
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am the owner of this exhibition house

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Nice to meet you, Boss Xiang

16
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is the third time we meet

17
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I didn't expect that

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you were so ignorant when you first came to the capital

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now you are the first member of the Pingjing Palace

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You have been promoted so fast in just a few months

21
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I am so curious

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What kind of tricks did you use

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
to build a high-rise building and make a fortune overnight?

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's not that

25
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I was just lucky

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well

27
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I admire your talent

28
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have also had two interactions with you

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I am quite lucky

30
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Since you can be the assistant of the Pingjing Palace

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
you might as well consider being my guest

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Whether you want to be a talent or a name

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can give you whatever Pingjing Palace gives you

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are you trying to steal the lord's wooden staff?

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No way

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's a good deal to be my friend

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I am sorry

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If you look at me with a high-pitched voice

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I will remember

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I dare not look up to you as a friend

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You were bullied by Yang Zhen, Qu Jiao, Chu Huai Ming

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and three other dogs in the pillow house

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I wanted to stay out of it

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Do you know why I helped you?

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because you are different from those three

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You are not a bad person

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So you should know

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Pingjing Duke is a martial artist

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He is a man of great skill

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He is suspicious

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He is a man of great skill

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You are under his control

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and you are living a life of blood

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So I want to ask you

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
why you are helping Pingjing Duke to sell your life for him?

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't know about the Ming and Zhu

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You are mistaken

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I am just a fish in a pot

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
All I do is

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to find a place

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
to settle down

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I see

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
you are not here

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you want to help him to regain his military power

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to prove your worth?

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I hope I can do what others can't do

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It seems that I underestimated you

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You and Pingjing Duke are the same kind

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I am the same kind

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I won't force you

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I hope you can succeed

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you, Boss Xiang

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Goodbye

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Please remember

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
In the capital

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you need more than I do

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If you find any trouble

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
don't be too embarrassed

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
for what you have done today

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I won't force you

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I hope you can succeed

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Thank you

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Goodbye

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Goodbye

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Goodbye

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Goodbye

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Goodbye

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Goodbye

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Goodbye

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Goodbye

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I heard that he rejected your invitation

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Goodbye

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Goodbye

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He is the one?

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He said he was a person who was good at pursuing fame and wealth

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But he is the one

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
who rejected our Boss Xiang's kindness

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He seems to have some good qualities

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What's going on?

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Can't you see it?

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He is determined to serve Pingjing Duke

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He wants to prove that he is a great person

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He can do great things

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But it's a pity

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He has made a mistake

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He is a good person

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If he can regain his military power one day

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
he will go back to the border

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and kill all the people

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yang Zhen is just a villain

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He is not a good person

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But he is different

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't want to see

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
such a capable person

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You want to get rid of him?

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A man is good for a thousand days

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
A flower is good for a hundred days

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now he is the most important person in the Duke's mansion

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He will be responsible for everything

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If he doesn't handle things well

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
he will lose Pingjing Duke's happiness

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Steward

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Lord Zang is back

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What are these?

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
These are gifts from outsiders

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They are for you

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You are not the red-haired man

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
around the Duke

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So they are here to welcome you

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Look

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Panchi, Gouyun, Yudai

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Look at the colors

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They are all very good

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Let me see this

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Open it

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is from Song dynasty

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Cui Zixi's

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Peacock and Peacock painting

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's a real skill

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Look

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The weaving and the hair

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
are very well done

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's really good

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Steward

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Why are these gifts

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
not paid?

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Take them all in

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Sir, you don't know

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is called return gift

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is the rule of the city's

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Gu Chengwen

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You just want to return

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
but you don't know who to return to

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When they need my help

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I will come out and accept these gifts

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You are smart

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Does the Duke know?

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is a gift from the Duke's mansion

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He knows

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What did he say?

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He can't handle these things

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Since the gift is for you

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
you can decide

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
decide

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I see

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I will accept these gifts

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Did he accept the gifts?

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Did you tell him

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
what return gift means?

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I did

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He knew

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Once he accepts the gifts

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
he will help people to solve the disaster

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Be careful

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Thank you

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Be careful

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Thank you

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What's wrong? Someone is eating porridge

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Have some

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Thank you, sir

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Miss

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Be careful

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Here

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Thank you

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thank you

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Thank you

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thank you

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Thank you

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Greetings, Duke

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What are you doing?

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Duke

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I received some gifts yesterday

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I was very worried

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I changed these gifts to food

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
in the name of Duke

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm lucky

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Duke is here

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Duke is here

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Thank you, Duke

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you, Duke

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Thank you, Duke

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Thank you, Duke

211
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you, Duke

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you, Duke

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Thank you

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Duke gave you ten porridge

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
to make you full

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Go get some

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Go get some

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Go get some

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Go get some

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hurry up

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I made the decision

222
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Please forgive me, Duke

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Zang Hai

224
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I didn't expect

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
you did it well

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I underestimated you

227
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Duke, you really killed me

228
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I can't forget

229
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm your man

230
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
These gifts are too valuable

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If I take them

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I owe Duke a favor

233
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't think

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
they will give you

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
more gifts

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Keep them

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you think I can't

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
help you?

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't think so

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
After the meal

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
go to my study

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and get some food

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't just read the four books

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You should read the military books too

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Congratulations, Lord Zang

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Duke means

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you can enter the study freely

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
without any need to go back

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Thank you

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The whole city knew

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
about yesterday's event

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No one came to give gifts today

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's hard to

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
take gifts

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's too high

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
to be suspected

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But I can't take them for real

259
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yang Zhen has been with Duke for more than ten years

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He knows him well

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I can't take gifts

262
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
without any fear

263
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Right

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Now many eyes are staring at you

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you know everything about the military

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
who taught you

269
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You taught me

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Did you

271
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
also work in the official field?

272
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No, no

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
When I was

274
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
in the military

275
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you were still playing with mud

276
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But I forgot

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
that the one who controlled

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
the building

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
was actually

280
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
a pretty girl

281
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
She started to harm me

282
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and then saved me

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Now I have to

284
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
rely on her

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
She gave you such a good price

286
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
but you refused

287
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's not easy

288
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She has brains

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and means

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
She's not a bad person

291
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The battle of Zanghai

292
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
is over

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The poor people in the whole capital

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
have been favored by her

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
She not only

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
has no interest in giving gifts

297
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
but also has the appreciation of Duke Pingjing

298
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You lost

299
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Boss Xiang is so small

300
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm afraid he will lose his reputation

301
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Do me a favor

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What do you want?

303
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No one in the capital

304
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
believes what the eighth young master said

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Please tell me

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What?

307
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
No

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I always tell the truth

309
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You are so stubborn

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How dare you refuse me

311
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I won't help

312
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Last time you insisted

313
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
on telling the Empress Dowager

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I was the one who helped you

315
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I just want to

316
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
make more money for the building

317
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
How about this

318
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I will give you

319
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
the money you said

320
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Just help me this time

321
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Please

322
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Please

323
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Make it clear

324
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Just this time?

325
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
This time

326
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This time in my life

327
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Han Shuiyi

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
has a face like a tiger

329
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He is not a man

330
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He has gold ears

331
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He is handsome

332
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
He is a man

333
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
He is a man

334
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Han Shuiyi

335
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
has a face like a tiger

336
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He is not a man

337
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't go

338
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't go

339
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
First, you are the one

340
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
who helped Pingjing Duke

341
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
find the way to the city

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I said you were a spy

343
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The most ridiculous thing is

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You are Pingjing Duke's illegitimate son

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Guess who did it

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Zhen Lou

347
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm afraid you offended

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Boss Xiang

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But that saying

350
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Han Shuiyi

351
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
has a face like a tiger

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He is handsome

353
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He is handsome

354
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He is handsome

355
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He is handsome

356
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
He is handsome

357
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He is handsome

358
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He is handsome

359
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He is handsome

360
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Tong Yao means

361
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You are in the Zhuang family

362
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Every time someone tries to

363
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
steal or do something shocking

364
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Five or six rumors

365
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
they all come together

366
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I think iTunes is wrong

367
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
They are embarrassed

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
They are embarrassed

369
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,800
In real

370
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I am in danger

371
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank you so much

372
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Thank you so much

373
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Han

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Why are you here?

375
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Go to the clinic and apologize to Boss Xiang.

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Is Boss Xiang here?

377
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
My master went out for a few days.

378
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Please go back, sir.

379
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
When will he be back?

380
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know.

381
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Then he...

382
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Go back.

383
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
As you wish.

384
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A great figure like Ping Jing Hou...

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
has many people who want to ask him to do things.

386
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But those who want to kill him...

387
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
can't be more than that.

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I've provided so many famous people for you.

389
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Smart people won't let him escape.

390
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What if in the end...

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Zang Hai doesn't roll the cover and leaves,

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
but loses his life?

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's also the price he chose for Ping Jing Hou.

394
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But I don't think he'll die easily.

395
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Let's see how he will pay.

396
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're back, sir.

397
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Who gave you these gifts?

398
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
They were sent today.

399
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They didn't leave a name.

400
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It seems that someone doesn't want to give up on you.

401
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Okay, I understand.

402
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You may leave.

403
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yes.

404
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I have a new request.

405
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm afraid that I can't repay you.

406
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll go to the lake to help you.

407
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'll be back in three days.

408
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll be back.

409
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'll be back.

410
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll be back.

411
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Dad!

412
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Mom, I'm sick.

413
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Take the medicine.

414
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You'll feel better.

415
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Dad!

416
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Dad!

417
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Dad!

418
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Dad!

419
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Dad!

420
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Dad, Mom, please bless me.

421
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'll kill Ping Jing Hou.

422
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
When that time comes,

423
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll bury you again.

424
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll bury you again.

425
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Zeng Han, have some.

428
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The maid sends tea and snacks every day.

429
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Sometimes she sends dinner.

430
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
During this period, there are housekeepers who can't do anything.

431
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Maybe the only chance is to poison Ping Jing Hou.

432
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Here you are.

433
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Fresh tea, fresh fruit, sweet and delicious.

434
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'll go to the lake to help you.

435
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'll be back.

436
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You're awake.

437
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's a threat.

438
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I didn't expect you to remember me.

439
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You're the one who threatened me.

440
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
What threat? What did I threaten you with?

441
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I... What did he say?

442
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't know.

443
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What nonsense is he talking about?

444
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I don't know.

445
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
What nonsense is he talking about?

446
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Did you reward him?

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No way. I have the power.

448
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Who is the one behind you?

449
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Instructor?

450
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Do you think we're like being instructed?

451
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Then why help me?

452
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'll tell you the truth.

454
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I want to borrow something from you.

455
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Your face.

456
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I want to put it on my face.

457
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You want to use my face to pretend to be me?

458
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yes.

459
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
To be honest,

460
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I've been in the Marquis's mansion for so many years.

461
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I want to do something very important.

462
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I want to get close to Pingjing Marquis.

463
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yang Zhen left.

464
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I thought I had a chance.

465
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
No one could stop me.

466
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I didn't expect you to show up.

467
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And he let us all disappear.

468
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I really didn't have a chance.

469
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I hate you.

470
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Have you ever thought that

471
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
it's not good to change your face like this?

472
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm afraid this kind of trick

473
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
will be revealed when you enter the Marquis's mansion.

474
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That's because you're short-sighted.

475
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Don't worry.

476
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
My sword is very good. It won't hurt.

477
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And we'll take good care of you.

478
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You...

479
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Actually,

481
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But I really have no choice.

483
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But I won't live in vain for too long.

484
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'll apologize to you in person when I get there.

485
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Shi Lei!

486
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
How did you tie it?

487
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I tied it tightly.

488
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You're so strong.

489
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Hold it.

490
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You're quite knowledgeable.

492
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Where did you get this?

493
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It has nothing to do with you.

494
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Then I ask you.

495
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Why did you get close to Pingjing Marquis?

496
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
If you die,

497
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'll tell you.

498
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I got close to Pingjing Marquis

499
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
to kill him

500
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and avenge my master.

501
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Your master?

502
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Is he here?

503
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
He's not my master.

504
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I want to avenge my real master.

505
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Who is your real master?

506
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Enough.

507
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Don't waste time.

508
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You'll die anyway.

509
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes!

510
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'll die anyway.

511
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Let me finish.

512
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Even if you really want to use my face,

513
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
it's not enough to only take the skin from the neck.

514
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You don't know,

515
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
right?

516
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
The skin of the neck and the front chest are connected.

517
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
If you're not careful,

518
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
your skin will be smooth.

519
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
If you want to do it without any flaws,

520
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
you have to start from the back.

521
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Nonsense.

522
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Do I need you to tell me?

523
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Take off your clothes.

524
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
What's wrong?

525
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
There's a scar.

526
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So what?

527
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
We want his face.

528
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'll knock him out first.

529
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
How did you get the scar?

530
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I got two scars.

531
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I got two scars on my back.

532
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I was pulled by someone with a whip when I was a kid.

533
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
My father was in the cave at that time.

534
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
My little brother gave me the medicine.

535
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But the scar was too deep.

536
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
He had no way.

537
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Then a master

538
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
fixed two scars for me.

539
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Why didn't he?

540
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Because I also

541
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
have blood and grudge.

542
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You are...

544
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
When my brother was three years old,

545
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
he was taken to my father's house

546
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and buried.

547
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
When I was a kid,

548
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I often went to the mountains with him to pick herbs.

549
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We escaped together.

550
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I did the wrong thing.

551
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
He always held me back.

552
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I always fooled him.

553
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Your brother...

554
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Was he punished

555
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
for his mistake?

556
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
He couldn't die

557
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
with his teacher and his wife.

558
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
He's still alive.

559
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Although he didn't get married,

560
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
he's still my father's

561
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
most beloved disciple.

562
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
If my father knew

563
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
he was still alive,

564
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
he would be so happy.

565
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
My father named him Guan Feng

566
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
because he thought

567
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Guan Feng was free

568
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and happy.

569
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I am Guan Feng.

570
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I am Guan Feng.

571
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I am Guan Feng.

572
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You are really the only slave.

573
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You are still alive.

574
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's good that he's alive.

575
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's good that he's alive.

576
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
That's the end

577
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
of the story.

578
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You were changed.

579
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
How could I not recognize you?

580
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You are not the same Fatty.

581
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We've changed a lot.

582
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Is your little master

583
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
really reliable?

584
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
He's an old man

585
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
who's been practicing

586
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
for many years.

587
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
He's willing to risk his life

588
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
to help me.

589
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Don't worry.

590
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But he's not

591
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
my master.

592
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It seems that you've been through

593
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
a lot these years.

594
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Tell me about it.

595
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'll tell you.

596
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That day,

597
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
you punished me to go to the mountain

598
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
to cut the firewood.

599
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I saw you coming back

600
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
from the southwest.

601
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I thought you'd be happy

602
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
if you came back.

603
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Maybe you wouldn't punish me.

604
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I ran down the mountain.

605
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
When I was about to get home,

606
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I heard a scream.

607
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I found many people around the door.

608
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They were holding knives in their hands.

609
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I quickly hid.

610
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
At that time,

611
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I saw someone coming out.

612
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It was Pingjing Duke.

613
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I saw my master and his wife

614
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
being carried out.

615
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I was so scared.

616
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I didn't know what happened.

617
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
When they left,

618
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I ran to my house.

619
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But the fire was too strong.

620
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I couldn't get in.

621
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Help! Come and cut the fire!

622
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I want to help the neighbors.

623
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But when the door opened,

624
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
it was full of corpses.

625
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I was so scared.

626
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Since then,

627
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I've been wandering the streets

628
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and living my life.

629
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But I've been keeping

630
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the sword from my master.

631
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I thought I could get revenge one day.

632
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Two buns, please.

633
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Okay.

634
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Here you are.

635
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay.

636
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Boss.

637
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Here you are.

638
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Buns, please.

639
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Okay. Thank you.

640
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You can eat now.

641
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That day, I met Shilei and Kaizhen Sanyuan.

642
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
They took me in

643
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and made me Shilei's disciple.

644
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
After Kaizhen Sanyuan passed away,

645
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I married Shilei.

646
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But in my life,

647
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
the only thing I didn't give up

648
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
was revenge.

649
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So I tried my best

650
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
to become a disciple in the Hou family.

651
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's all my fault.

652
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm not good enough.

653
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I haven't had any enemies

654
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
in all these years.

655
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
But it's okay.

656
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Now you're here.

657
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Let's get revenge together.

658
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Now you're the first disciple

659
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
in the Hou family.

660
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
What do you think?

661
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Is it easy?

662
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Actually, before you came,

663
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
someone forced me to kill Ping Jinghao.

664
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I was about to take the risk

665
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and was caught by you.

666
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Who do you think

667
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
is the person who threatened you?

668
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I don't know yet.

669
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But it doesn't matter who it is.

670
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I will kill Ping Jinghao anyway.

671
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
You said

672
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
there's a key thing.

673
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
What is it?

674
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Ping Jinghao killed so many people

675
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
just to find something

676
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
my father brought back from the East.

677
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But he failed.

678
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
My father should have hidden it in advance.

679
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But I can't imagine

680
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
where he would hide it.

681
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Hide something?

682
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Hide something?

683
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Didn't you just tell me

684
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
my father came back from the East

685
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and walked to the southwest?

686
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
He should have walked to the northeast.

687
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
If he walked to the southwest,

688
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
he would have been surrounded.

689
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Did he walk like that

690
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
to hide something?

691
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Do you remember when he was a kid,

692
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
he often took us to the mountains

693
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
to host classes?

694
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But I only remember

695
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
there were a few mountains.

696
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Where do you think he could hide

697
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
something that was not found?

698
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Liu Xianmu.

699
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
He took me to the East.

700
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yes.

701
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Why would he hide something there?

702
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The End

703
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
The End

704
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The End

705
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The End

706
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
The End
