1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,080
The Long

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,780
By luck

3
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,360
oh

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,160
Did she find out

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,920
Mr. reparative

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:51,740
Once she onions into the

7
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:58,840
Increanged

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,680
Da Lu,

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,120
since you can't find it,

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,760
I don't need to wait any longer.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,360
It's time to use my method.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,520
Sir,

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
why don't you let me look for it?

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,000
I can't find the treasure

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,600
that Zang Hai wanted to hide.

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,680
Master.

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,400
What's the matter?

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,960
Zang is here to ask for a leave tonight.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,880
I know.

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Sir, I know what you want to say.

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,920
Don't worry.

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,200
I did it for her.

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,800
You can leave now.

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,520
Who's calling?

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
Who's calling?

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,400
Whom is it?

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,940
Gu Z Filipino.

28
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,180
Is he calling again?

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
It's time to eat.

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,480
Go ahead.

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,960
Yes.

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,440
Eunuch.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,000
Please.

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,440
Xiao Hai,

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
you made a good dish

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,680
while I was away.

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,440
Master Xia Chu,

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
it's time to sit down.

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,520
It's a blue dish,

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,960
but it's a fish.

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,520
Gao Ming,

42
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,160
you're not going to eat

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,200
your master's food.

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,160
Eunuch, please sit.

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,640
Where are the others?

46
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,640
I've prepared

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,080
everyone's food today.

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,560
As a result,

49
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,880
Feng Liu's family

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,320
insisted on taking the poison

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,520
to watch the lanterns.

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,880
Guan Feng and Shi Lei went together.

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,120
In the blink of an eye,

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,040
I'm the only one left

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
in this family.

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,200
Master, sit.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,880
Okay.

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,400
Eunuch,

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,320
recently,

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,680
I've learned a lot

61
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,160
from you in the Inner Pavilion.

62
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,120
I'll drink this wine

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,200
to celebrate your birthday.

64
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,360
Okay.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,960
Zhang Hai,

66
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,760
you're willing to

67
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,560
share so many things for me

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,360
and drink this wine

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,120
to celebrate my birthday.

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
Eunuch, please.

71
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,640
Okay.

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,160
Try this.

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,960
Fried eggs with tomato.

74
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,520
Okay.

75
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,240
My mother

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
gave it to me.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,880
My family has too many people.

78
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,320
They can't eat fish and meat.

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,080
My mother-in-law

80
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,160
has raised a lot of them.

81
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,200
Try this.

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,920
A small scallion and tofu.

83
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
My father loves it the most.

84
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,080
There's a point in this dish.

85
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,560
A model of the emperor of開國,

86
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
found that she wanted a good childhood friend

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
and a local official to stay in the house.

88
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,480
But she didn't have the royal law.

89
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,400
She was a palace maid

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
and killed her childhood friend.

91
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,920
As a result,

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,680
she was afraid that she would be implicated

93
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,320
and she would be framed.

94
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,320
Later, she gave the emperor

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,920
a peach jar in the winter

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,720
and cooked the food.

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,800
Inside,

98
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,120
she put a small scallion and tofu.

99
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,360
The emperor ate a big piece of the food

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,400
and made all the officials

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,280
to pay her back.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,400
One hundred and two hundred.

103
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
It's a bit like

104
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,440
what I did at the time.

105
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,480
She can get the emperor's understanding.

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,200
It's not a dish

107
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
that depends on her.

108
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
It's the face

109
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,240
that the emperor gave her.

110
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,200
Just like my father

111
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
who was in charge of the court

112
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,680
and was in charge of the justice.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
He was in charge of justice.

114
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
He was in charge of the auction.

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,200
If it weren't for my father,

116
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm afraid that the Eunuch

117
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,640
would have no other choice.

118
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,080
I have no objection

119
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,600
to your father's kindness.

120
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,800
My father never wants to return.

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,680
But he can't

122
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,160
repay his kindness

123
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,840
and should not repay his kindness.

124
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,600
Mr. Zhao,

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,040
should I call you Eunuch

126
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,920
or your enemy?

127
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,800
Xiao Hai.

128
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,520
Xiao Hai.

129
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,760
You mean

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
it's not a casual trial, right?

131
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,640
Yes.

132
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
You asked the teachers

133
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,760
to teach me so well.

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,280
How could you

135
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,640
use the death of Shi Yiping

136
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,120
to trick me?

137
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,280
Even if you are

138
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
so ungrateful,

139
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,720
you are the teacher that you took me to.

140
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,000
As long as I have a doubt in my heart,

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,920
I will find out the truth sooner or later.

142
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,880
So many delicious dishes in the world!

143
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,800
You even ate the soup from fest give?

144
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,560
Indeed!

145
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
What did you find?

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,280
Lumin.

147
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,080
Lumin.

148
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,960
You have since stayed at the archery at University of University ofron?

149
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,920
inside a Buddhist world.

150
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,280
Do you still remember?

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:45,560
What a

152
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,960
仙玉一世

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,120
You can't give up.

154
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,560
Since you're ready

155
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,860
you must have

156
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,820
no right to leave here.

157
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
You guys all leave.

158
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,500
I've had quite an opportunity.

159
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,400
For example,

160
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,000
You are indeed the third person.

161
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,600
But you are not the main character.

162
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,040
You came late.

163
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,360
You couldn't stop them

164
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,720
from getting in my house.

165
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,240
Today,

166
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,920
I have a question.

167
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,840
Because of the truth,

168
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,080
you are the only one who knows.

169
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,400
Zang Hai,

170
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,440
you are indeed a natural.

171
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,040
I really don't know

172
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,120
whether God has

173
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,880
any grudges for you.

174
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,400
Unfortunately,

175
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,960
I know more

176
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,120
than you do.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
But now,

178
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't want to hide it from you.

179
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,920
I

180
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
am your last enemy.

181
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,640
And the thing about the Quai family's destruction

182
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,360
is what I planned.

183
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,480
Even if your father

184
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,240
is not dead in the hands of Zhuang Ruying,

185
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,560
and he is handed over to Gui Xi,

186
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,800
he won't be alive.

187
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
The Quai family's destruction

188
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
is the only thing that can be done.

189
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,960
I don't want to hide it from you.

190
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,400
I don't want to hide it from you.

191
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't want to hide it from you.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
I don't want to hide it from you.

193
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
I don't want to hide it from you.

194
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
I don't want to hide it from you.

195
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,800
I don't want to hide it from you.

196
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,400
I don't want to hide it from you.

197
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,800
I don't want to hide it from you.

198
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,200
I don't want to hide it from you.

199
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,800
I don't want to hide it from you.

200
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't want to hide it from you.

201
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
I don't want to hide it from you.

202
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I don't want to hide it from you.

203
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I don't want to hide it from you.

204
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I don't want to hide it from you.

205
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I don't want to hide it from you.

206
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,640
I don't want to hide it from you.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,200
I don't want to hide it from you.

208
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,560
I'm the 14th Lady of Blood Chess�� readily accepted it.

209
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,080
You saved me after all,

210
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,840
and now I get too much.

211
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
I can let you die of carelessness.

212
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,440
You can find me,

213
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,480
but you're really good as well.

214
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
But there's one thing you said was wrong,

215
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,120
Shiyi's death

216
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,080
is not to deceive you.

217
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm deceiving someone else.

218
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,840
Don't move.

219
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,040
Let the emperor seal

220
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,440
and Kalim cumulative MCOM.

221
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,200
Take him away.

222
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,040
I will remember to bring her back.

223
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:11,880
Hurry.

224
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,120
talk to him.

225
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,280
You...

227
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,920
Zang Hai.

228
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,480
Do you know what it feels like to be the emperor?

229
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,680
I don't know.

230
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,040
I feel lonely.

231
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,600
The world is a big thing.

232
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,720
I'm the only one who can break it.

233
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,760
I have to guard the throne.

234
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,640
I have to be able to help the people.

235
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,720
I have to be able to treat the people.

236
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,560
I have to be able to help the people.

237
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,040
So you like the palace?

238
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,080
Because you made it for yourself?

239
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,280
I've been the emperor.

240
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
I have nothing to do.

241
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
I've been missing the days before.

242
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,880
But if I didn't become the emperor,

243
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,200
I'm afraid I would have died long ago.

244
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,240
I don't understand

245
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,400
why your father

246
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,240
doesn't trust me.

247
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,280
Your Majesty,

248
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,640
my father didn't betray you.

249
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,840
Otherwise,

250
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,160
he wouldn't have been dead

251
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,920
and never said anything about the wedding.

252
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
I've been asking your father.

253
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,720
Why did you keep the secret

254
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,800
and keep it secret for me?

255
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
You can't tell me.

256
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,680
Are you afraid of him?

257
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,960
My father died for the sake of the great Yi.

258
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,440
He didn't do it to keep the secret for you.

259
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,720
He just didn't want the ghost blood to be opened again.

260
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
The poison?

261
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,720
I've made it simple for you.

262
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,200
Zang Hai,

263
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,720
you lied to me.

264
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,120
I won't kill you.

265
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,720
I won't be jealous of the people around you.

266
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,560
But...

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,040
you have to hand over the Tong Yu.

268
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,540
If only you could say something specific to me really easily!

269
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,100
Myéléments inculcated me.

270
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,420
How am I going to find it?

271
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,340
He costs you.

272
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,740
I can't be lying.

273
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,600
верхазтё пришучтplat Armstrong,

274
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,400
who's now sinking on the ship.

275
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,400
Step aside.

276
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,200
The Tong Yu lighted the头 star,

277
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,440
The minister ofrates said,

278
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,120
your ex-law and he are sixteen years older than me.

279
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,840
They would be all alltsåomnes.

280
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,040
Four years greater than you.

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,760
and everything else,

282
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,600
in an infinite ring.

283
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,880
King of Rites,

284
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,760
I will pity you

285
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,520
if it's true.

286
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,600
Great.

287
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,920
When did you realize that I was going to use it?

288
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,800
My great Yong has been in power for decades.

289
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,520
He never used the sword to cut the fish.

290
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,920
He was so lucky to have the fish.

291
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
I wanted to get it

292
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,880
because I was the one who took the fish

293
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,200
from the late emperor's grave.

294
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,400
You hid the fish

295
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,440
because you were afraid that your father would die soon.

296
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,760
You wanted to follow your father's will.

297
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,240
But I didn't.

298
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,640
You can't say no

299
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,800
in profile.

300
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,120
Your Majesty,

301
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,040
we need to protect our baby.

302
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,000
Your Majesty.

303
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,240
It's a які.

304
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,960
But how could the Joseon

305
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,000
protect the head of the fraternity,

306
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,680
the future of the imperial army?

307
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,280
If you can saveственно

308
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
many people were killed by him.

309
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
As the ruler of the world,

310
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
he was killed by the King of the Four Seas,

311
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
and he was killed by the Four Seas.

312
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
I beg Your Majesty to take back this item.

313
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
I have one more thing.

314
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
My third enemy

315
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
is not dead.

316
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
It's Zhao Bingwen.

317
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Everything that happened before

318
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
was done by him to deceive us.

319
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
He told you about the copper fish

320
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
because he didn't want me to avenge my family.

321
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Tell me

322
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
that it's not Zhao Bingwen.

323
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
It's Cao Jingxian.

324
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Cao Jingxian.

325
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Your Majesty.

326
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
What's going on?

327
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Your Majesty, this man is being taken by the army outside the palace.

328
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,280
He is the real man who has been in the military for a long time.

329
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
He told me to see you.

330
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
He also said something

331
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
that I can't say.

332
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I, Shi Quan, beg Your Majesty

333
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
to show me your treasure.

334
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
You may leave now.

335
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Yes.

336
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
I remember you have another name.

337
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
I am the son of Eunuch Cao.

338
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
My name is Lu Fen.

339
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
You took away my item with him.

340
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Cao Jingxian is dead.

341
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Why do you still have the face to live?

342
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I should have gone with Eunuch Cao.

343
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
But I can't avenge Eunuch.

344
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
I can't see him die.

345
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
How do you want to avenge him?

346
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Tell me.

347
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Do you know

348
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
that the opening of the ghost blood

349
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
needs three copper fish?

350
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
What did you say?

351
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
I want to report to the Zanghai

352
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
to hide His Majesty's treasure.

353
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Your Majesty, I am not going back.

354
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Your Majesty.

355
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Your Majesty.

356
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
You are finally here.

357
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
I have done everything

358
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
that you told him.

359
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Please investigate.

360
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Zhao Bingwen admitted to me

361
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
that he is the third person.

362
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
And that day,

363
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Zhao Bingwen took me to visit Shi Yiping.

364
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
He could hide Lu Yan

365
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
and kill Shi Gelao

366
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
and hide Lu Fen

367
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
to report to you.

368
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
All right.

369
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
About Zhao Bingwen,

370
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I will investigate it myself.

371
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Your Majesty, be careful.

372
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
He will definitely

373
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
make the ghost blood.

374
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

375
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Take him down.

376
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
When I am done,

377
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
we will talk about it.

378
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Guards.

379
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Tomorrow morning,

380
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
send Zhao Bingwen

381
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
to meet me.

382
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

383
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Your Majesty.

384
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Your Majesty.

385
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Your Majesty.

386
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Your Majesty.

387
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Your Majesty.

388
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Your Majesty.

389
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Your Majesty.

390
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
Your Majesty.

391
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
You are going to lie to His Majesty again?

392
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
His Majesty didn't even ask me

393
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
why I lie to him.

394
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,480
and forced me to give my copper fish to His Majesty.

395
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,280
You can't get it

396
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
just like that.

397
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,680
His Majesty was in a bad condition last night.

398
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,680
He was in a bad mood.

399
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
And you were the last person to see him.

400
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,680
He was poisoned again.

401
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,080
What did Eunuch Sun know?

402
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,080
He didn't come back.

403
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
I'm the first one to know.

404
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,080
I'm grateful to His Majesty's trust.

405
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,480
His Majesty is in trouble.

406
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,280
I was in a bad situation

407
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,680
with Sun Defang and Xue Zhao.

408
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
Now I'm protecting His Majesty.

409
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm in a bad situation

410
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,480
because I'm in a bad situation.

411
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,480
It's a pity.

412
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Now, this is destined to happen.

413
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,880
If you don't break my identity,

414
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,280
at this moment,

415
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,880
I can use the power of the Manor to release you.

416
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,480
Let you follow me.

417
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
There are many things in the future.

418
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,680
We can do it together.

419
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,680
A lie

420
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,080
needs countless lies.

421
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,080
One day, it will be revealed.

422
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,080
If a lie is a trick,

423
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,880
the number of lies is the Yang-Mou.

424
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,080
The Yang-Mou is the Yin-Mou.

425
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,480
The Yang-Mou is the Cheng-Zhi-Yu.

426
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,880
Do you know the difference?

427
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,680
When did you start to trick me?

428
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,280
Tell me.

429
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,480
When you give the Ghost-Blood-Blood to His Majesty,

430
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,080
he told me the truth.

431
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,080
He told me to be more cautious

432
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,080
because you have many princes.

433
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,680
But it's really hard

434
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,280
to let you give the last copper fish.

435
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,080
So you decided to put the copper fish and Ghost-Blood-Blood-Blood

436
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,080
in the Shiyi Pavilion.

437
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,080
It can be framed as the third person.

438
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,880
And then His Majesty can get the Ghost-Blood-Blood-Blood-Blood-Blood.

439
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,680
He completely eliminated the concern about it.

440
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,280
He used the copper fish in my hand

441
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,280
to get rid of me and His Majesty.

442
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,080
The one who gets the Jiang-Yu

443
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,480
must be the first to know.

444
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,080
The king of the Hotashing head should announce

445
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,080
that the Mu density will die.

446
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
This is the average.

447
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,080
It's not that much to say in an office.

448
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Haixing.

449
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,080
General.

450
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,880
There isn't a single person empty inside.

451
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,880
It seems that they are almost ready.

452
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,880
Send my men to Chicanos.

453
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,080
Yes, commander.

454
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Do you want me

455
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,680
to explore the crappy egyim thing

456
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,280
It's possible that he was used.

457
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,120
If I didn't tell Tong Yu,

458
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,960
I wouldn't be able to prove to His Majesty

459
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,040
that you are the third person.

460
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,480
I know what kind of person you are.

461
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,800
You want to take revenge,

462
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,400
but you can't change your nature.

463
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,520
In this world,

464
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,840
kind people are always hard-working.

465
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,160
Because they have too many concerns and too many thousands.

466
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,440
As long as you and Kuiduo make the same choice,

467
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,160
you can't deal with me with His Majesty.

468
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,640
You know my father so well.

469
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,800
It's true that the story of you and His Majesty is fake.

470
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,660
ugly things just lie the truth.

471
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:05,020
真的很 bad from the ninth

472
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,560
and she

473
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,000
by Pom Ηit I also

474
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,400
to beg His Majesty to punish him.

475
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,800
However,

476
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,480
we didn't lose the king.

477
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,000
I didn't receive his letter

478
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,560
in Yuezhou.

479
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,640
That letter

480
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,800
was sent to me by Zhuang Wu.

481
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,040
I asked Gao Ming to stay in Yuezhou

482
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,000
and rush back to the capital.

483
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,000
I asked Cao Jingxian to arrange a private meeting

484
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,720
and to take care of the capital.

485
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,760
On that day,

486
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,160
I found your father's trace of the capital.

487
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
But

488
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,160
he suddenly disappeared.

489
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,440
I didn't expect

490
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,280
he had been secretly in the capital.

491
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,120
We waited for him to come back

492
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,520
by your side.

493
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,040
I was right.

494
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,600
You were the one who took the lead

495
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,520
and asked them to take the blame

496
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,920
for our family.

497
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,520
And you were the one who disobeyed His Majesty.

498
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,800
You caged his welcome

499
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,080
and wiped out anyone at last.

500
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,480
Then,

501
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,720
I waited for

502
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,960
someone to falselyeleri about the book

503
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,680
and place the person

504
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,920
in the secret Mole학교

505
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,280
in there.

506
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,600
But no other pill

507
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
could suggest that

508
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,000
he killed he himself with the ability

509
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,960
and no one else.

510
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,040
It's really a sad story

511
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,440
After all, I had known through you

512
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,880
the man is the emperor

513
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,040
Zhuang Luyin

514
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,240
for you

515
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,920
Cao Jingxian

516
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,140
for you

517
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,680
How could you let them

518
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,520
dare to have you最後

519
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,120
kept on hiding you?

520
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,120
I was born in a small town in the war of war.

521
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,120
My father named me Binhwen.

522
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,120
He wanted me to be the king of the world.

523
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,120
One day, I could enter the imperial court.

524
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
I didn't give up.

525
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
I was afraid that I would be in danger.

526
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
I was afraid that I would be in danger.

527
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
I was in danger.

528
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
I didn't give up.

529
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
I was 10 years old.

530
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
I entered the college of Dayong.

531
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
In Dayong,

532
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,120
most of the students are from the family of the family.

533
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,120
Soon, I became a spy.

534
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Because I was born in a poor family,

535
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
I was born in a poor family.

536
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Let me go.

537
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
Let me go.

538
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
You want to be a man like us?

539
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
Dream.

540
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Dayong's rules are that the people of Dayong are not as good as the court.

541
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Today, you are dead.

542
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,120
You are dead because of your ambition.

543
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
You are a loser.

544
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
You even dare to kill him.

545
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
You also have to leave a finger today.

546
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
Master, hurry up. They are there.

547
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
You are a little bastard.

548
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Wait for me.

549
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
Are you okay?

550
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
I'm fine.

551
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
My name is Lu Min.

552
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
He is a man of the royal family.

553
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
What's your name?

554
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
I'm Zhao Binwen.

555
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Lu Min was born in a poor family like me.

556
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Zhuanglong and his father died in the border.

557
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,120
They were killed in the middle of the road.

558
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
After that,

559
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
the three of us

560
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,120
were completely isolated by those family members.

561
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,120
We often got bullied.

562
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,120
We were once against each other.

563
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,120
But even the father and son were against each other.

564
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,120
I understand that.

565
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
There is something in the world

566
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
called the world.

567
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,120
If you don't want to be bullied by him,

568
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,120
you should let him be scared of you first.

569
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
You come first.

570
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
You are so brave to hit me.

571
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
It's you.

572
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
I won't let you go.

573
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,120
I'll tell my father when I get back.

574
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
When he comes,

575
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
I'll kill you all.

576
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
Don't run.

577
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Help.

578
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Help.

579
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
Help.

580
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Help.

581
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120
Help.

582
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Did you get bullied by someone after you fell asleep?

583
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,120
Other people bullied us sooner or later.

584
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,120
We were forced to live

585
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
to make things worse.

586
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
But

587
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
you still can't keep it.

588
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
hatred won't disappear.

589
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Lu Min's injury

590
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
made them believe

591
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
it is related to the falling water.

592
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Brother.

593
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,120
Lu Ming's life has been ruined.

594
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,120
He can't stay in the Great Yongxue Palace anymore.

595
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,120
He can only enter the palace and become a eunuch.

596
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Let's go.

597
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,120
You've stepped out of this step.

598
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,120
The outside world has nothing to do with you.

599
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
After many years,

600
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,120
I've changed my name to Lu Ming,

601
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
and became the eunuch.

602
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Zhuang Ruyin defeated Dong Xia

603
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
and became the great general of Xianhe.

604
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
I also went to the position of the Governor of Inner He.

605
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Only I could see the great general of Xianhe.

606
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Only we know

607
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
that each other is real friends.

608
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
If it weren't for you,

609
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,120
I'm afraid they wouldn't be like this today.

610
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Miss, don't worry.

611
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,120
They'll know about it later.

612
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
An Tu.

613
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
Tong'er.

614
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
You finally came.

615
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
An Tu.

616
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,120
I can't let go of Ding Shao's men.

617
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
But I still can't save them.

618
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
How did you find such a secret place?

619
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,120
I thought you were all out of the city.

620
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
This is the shelter for Zhang Hai.

621
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
He left yesterday.

622
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
We came here

623
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
after he took our army.

624
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
An Tu.

625
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Now go to the palace.

626
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
An Tu.

627
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,120
The whole city is waiting for you.

628
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
But be careful.

629
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
But His Majesty promised to give us freedom last night.

630
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,120
Why did he arrest us today?

631
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,120
What happened to Zhang Hai?

632
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Come.

633
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
I don't know

634
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
what Mr. Zhang said to His Majesty.

635
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
But he was in the palace today

636
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
and was in a bad mood.

637
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
They all said

638
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Zhang Hai needed to kill His Majesty.

639
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
How could Zhang Hai kill His Majesty?

640
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
He was wronged.

641
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Where are you going?

642
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
I'll go save him.

643
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
Zhang Hai is in the prison now.

644
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
How could you save him?

645
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Maybe you were caught first

646
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
before you saw him.

647
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
I'll find Yong Rong.

648
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
He will save Zhang Hai.

649
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Yong Rong is the eldest royal family.

650
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
His Majesty was suspected

651
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
of being the first one.

652
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
Besides,

653
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
he was locked up in the mansion.

654
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,120
He can't even go out.

655
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Now, who else can save him?

656
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
An Tu.

657
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Don't be angry.

658
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
Let's think of a way.

659
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
How about

660
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
I ask my father?

661
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
Tong.

662
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
The next words I'll say

663
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,120
may make you feel difficult.

664
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,120
But I have to tell you.

665
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
It's about my father.

666
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Why did you save me?

667
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Why did you raise me up?

668
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
If you didn't tell me

669
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
that I had the third one,

670
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,120
I might never know.

671
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Besides being hated by enemies,

672
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
can you still live?

673
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
I told you three enemies

674
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
that I hoped

675
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,120
you would never stop fighting.

676
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,120
Until the end,

677
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,120
you can help me find Gui Xi.

678
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,120
You are now the head of the Inner Council.

679
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,120
Why must you do that?

680
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
The Yong is very powerful.

681
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,120
You need to be a good man.

682
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,120
You need to be a good man.

683
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,120
As long as there are people like him,

684
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,120
even His Majesty

685
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,120
will be able to meet the great power.

686
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,120
I want to change the world.

687
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,120
But the world

688
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,120
can't be saved

689
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,120
by people like Kaiduo.

690
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,120
And Gui Xi is different.

691
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
As long as he is there,

692
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
I can turn all the people in the East

693
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,120
into soldiers

694
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
and lead a army

695
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,120
that is as strong as the other.

696
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
I can let all the princes

697
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
be in great danger.

698
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
I can let their people

699
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,120
be in great danger.

700
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
You will only

701
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
be in the chaos

702
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,120
of the world

703
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
if you do that.

704
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,120
The world will be

705
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,120
full of people.

706
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
I will definitely

707
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
send you

708
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
a letter

709
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,120
to the people of Huo.

710
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Only those who fail

711
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,120
will be in trouble.

712
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,120
As long as I complete this,

713
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
someone will

714
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
send me a letter.
