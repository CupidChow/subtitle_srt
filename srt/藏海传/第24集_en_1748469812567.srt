1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Sub to 你不用寻找inaudible.

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:26,780
Father.

3
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,240
Welcome.

4
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,840
Duke, please have a seat.

5
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,400
Where have you been?

6
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,880
Guards.

7
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,880
Do you have any idea that

8
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,720
I was toldeed that you,

9
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
Chief Eunuch Cao,

10
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,840
was vanquished

11
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,880
by Duke Cao Jingxuan?

12
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,700
Do you really think

13
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,300
he could have happened

14
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,500
like this?

15
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,320
I believe that

16
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,960
Today plumbing has a clear,

17
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,120
but once Pek jing got

18
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,160
detained for longer,

19
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,160
takes me by surprise.

20
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Even if the innocent people go in, they will be punished.

21
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,160
My Lord, we should be sending this letter to the court.

22
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,160
The ancestors of the Zhuang family have made great contributions.

23
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
They have fought for the Great Yong for generations.

24
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
His Majesty will not ignore it.

25
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Now, Cao Jingxian, on behalf of His Majesty,

26
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,160
will take over the power and take the memorial tablet to the ground.

27
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
He will also take it.

28
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Do you want me to go straight to the palace and meet His Majesty?

29
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,160
My lords, you all grew up watching the House of Zhi.

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Now that the House of Zhi is in danger,

31
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,160
you all won't just stand by and watch, right?

32
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Of course not.

33
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
The matter of the Marquis is our matter.

34
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Marquis, in my opinion,

35
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,160
this matter may be a misunderstanding.

36
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Marquis, why don't you go straight to Eunuch Cao and make things clear?

37
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Lord Lü is confused.

38
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Eunuch Cao is arrogant.

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,160
He has long ignored the dignity of the Marquis.

40
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Now, he is soft.

41
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,160
He will only be more angry.

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Besides, the House of Zhi is the Minister of Works.

43
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
He is the official of the court.

44
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
He won't let go of the person.

45
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
He is wrong in the first place.

46
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Marquis, how can I be so sure

47
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,160
that I have the right to bow to him and admit my mistakes?

48
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,160
No, no, no. I have no such intention.

49
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
There are not many people who bow to Cao Jingxian.

50
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
If I remember correctly,

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Lord Lü offended Eunuch Cao before.

52
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Has the title of the Minister of Works been restored to this day?

53
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Lord Lü was once a servant, right?

54
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,160
You came to beg for mercy and spent a lot of money on Eunuch Cao.

55
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,160
But you were still promoted to the Minister of Works.

56
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
You forgot so soon?

57
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Besides, how many losses did you suffer from Cao Jingxian?

58
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
How many sufferings did you suffer from the Minister of Works?

59
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Don't you want to vent your anger?

60
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Cao Jingxian is arrogant and evil.

61
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Do you think my great country will be destroyed by this Ning Chen?

62
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,160
I will never work with this traitor.

63
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,160
Marquis, please tell us what we should do.

64
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Okay.

65
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Zhuang Shan.

66
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Yes.

67
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Please.

68
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Tomorrow morning, I will meet with His Majesty to discuss the matter.

69
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Now, please ask Da Yong to do something

70
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
and impeach Cao Jingxian with me.

71
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
The title has been signed.

72
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Please, my lords.

73
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
I am the Vice Governor of the Imperial Censorate.

74
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I will go first.

75
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I will go too.

76
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Lord Lü.

77
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Lord Lü.

78
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Please.

79
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Lord Lü.

80
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Marquis, you are a guest.

81
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Why don't you invite me?

82
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Am I not worthy?

83
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Eunuch Cao, why are you here?

84
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
To celebrate your birthday.

85
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
This is a Lu Mo knife that I got from Da Yong.

86
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,160
It's been a thousand years since I last saw it.

87
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,160
It's been a thousand years, but it's still very sharp.

88
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
The world is being slashed.

89
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Marquis doesn't see me as a friend.

90
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,160
But I have always been thinking about you.

91
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Back then, we were in the same boat.

92
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Eunuch Cao, you are thoughtful.

93
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Then sit down and have a drink.

94
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I will find a place for myself.

95
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Marquis invited all the officials

96
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,160
not just for the birthday.

97
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Isn't that right, Lord Lü?

98
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,160
So Marquis is in the British Army.

99
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
He wants to impeach me.

100
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
But this is a good deal.

101
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,160
He wrote me so badly.

102
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,160
I feel so wronged.

103
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,160
So, are you all here to impeach me?

105
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
It's getting late.

106
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,160
I suddenly remembered that my mother is still in the house.

107
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I will take care of her.

108
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
I will take my leave.

109
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Marquis, Eunuch, I have something to do.

110
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I will take my leave.

111
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,160
I will see who dares to leave today!

112
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Cao Jingxian, you not only abducted my son,

113
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
but also came here without permission.

114
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
You broke the rules.

115
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
What do you want?

116
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
I came here today

117
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
to send you back.

118
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Bring him here!

119
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Master!

120
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
What's wrong with you?

121
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Guards!

122
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Everyone, bend his arms.

123
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Father!

124
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,160
The House of Zhuang has been corrupting the treasury for years.

125
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,160
His Majesty is angry and wants me to interrogate him.

126
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
He is stubborn.

127
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,160
I can only get him to come to his senses.

128
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,160
He really did interrogate a lot of people.

129
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,160
These are all the crimes that the House of Zhuang committed.

130
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,160
It's written in black and white.

131
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,160
But it's not all.

132
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Master, I saw you working in the Ministry of Works.

133
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,160
You don't have the guts to steal so much money.

134
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Tell me, is your father behind you making decisions?

135
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Is he recruiting soldiers to buy horses

136
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
or building a ship to build a bridge?

137
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Shut up!

138
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,160
I'm not going to tell you.

139
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Master Zhang, as long as you kneel down and confess,

140
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160
your son will be spared.

141
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Father!

142
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Please save my son.

143
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Master!

144
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Surround them!

145
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
You keep harming the officials of the court.

146
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
You even want to frame me.

147
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
I'll kill you right now!

148
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Let's go.

149
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Lin Jinghong, you dare to kill me?

150
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Come on!

151
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Lin Jinghong, you're going to scare me!

152
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Someone's going to kill me!

153
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Master Zhang is going to kill me!

154
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Lin Jinghong, kill me!

155
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Kill me!

156
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Kill me!

157
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Kill me!

158
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Kill me!

159
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Kill me!

160
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
My son.

161
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
He's suffering.

162
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,160
How could this happen?

163
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Zhang Luoyin is trying to rebel.

164
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,160
I've discovered that he's trying to lure people into his trap.

165
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,160
He's trying to kill people and destroy the court.

166
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,160
All officials are aware of this.

167
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Tomorrow, this matter will spread throughout the whole capital.

168
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,160
It will spread to His Majesty's ears.

169
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Zhang Luoyin, have you thought about

170
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,160
how to explain it to His Majesty?

171
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Cao Jingxian, you're so sinister!

172
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,160
My lord, this matter is not something that can't be turned around.

173
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Whether your son is greedy or not,

174
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
whether you have a horse to raise,

175
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
it's all about the Grand Commandant's Office.

176
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,160
It's up to you if you want to solve it or not.

177
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,160
As long as you hand over Guixi,

178
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,160
today, I'll kill you.

179
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
I'll kill you.

180
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,160
I can get him back to His Majesty

181
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
if I have to do it tonight.

182
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
It's just a misunderstanding.

183
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Guixi?

184
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
How could I possibly have Guixi?

185
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Zhang Luoyin, don't play dumb with me.

186
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,160
You've been looking for Guixi.

187
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
You've been looking for me too.

188
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
I'll ask you one last time.

189
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Should I hand over the item or not?

190
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Even if it's in my hands,

191
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
you old bastard,

192
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
you won't get it.

193
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Guards!

194
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Search!

195
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Search carefully!

196
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Those who defy me will be killed!

197
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,160
I'll see if you have the ability.

198
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Search!

199
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Search!

200
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Search!

201
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Luoyan has followed us.

202
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
Keep an eye on the rear.

203
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Who's there?

204
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Eunuch asked me to help you.

205
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Even I have to help you with this.

206
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
You can't come by yourself.

207
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Why did you agree to help him?

208
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
When that man comes,

209
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
how can I explain to him?

210
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I'll be in trouble.

211
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,160
I'll be fine if he doesn't beat me.

212
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Lord Zang.

213
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Hello?

214
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Who are you?

215
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Who are you?

216
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Your Highness, please.

217
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
What are you looking for?

218
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Hey?

219
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Don't be rash.

220
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
The ground is not water.

221
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
It's oil.

222
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
I heard that Dong Xia's son

223
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
hasn't been out for many years.

224
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Now he suddenly appears

225
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
in the underground cellar of the Marquis's mansion.

226
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
You must be looking for

227
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
something very important.

228
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Since the previous queen of Dong Xia died,

229
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Dong Xia lost

230
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
one treasure,

231
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Ghostly Joy.

232
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
Ten years ago,

233
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
the Qing Tian Sword was stolen.

234
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Kuaido took Ghostly Joy back to Dayou.

235
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
You knew that Kuaido got it,

236
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
so you joined Cao Jinxian and Zhuang Luying

237
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,160
to kill the entire Kuaizha family.

238
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
It's a pity

239
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
that the thing is still unknown.

240
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
For so many years,

241
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,160
you never gave up on searching.

242
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Am I right?

243
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
But you were deceived.

244
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
There is no Ghostly Joy here.

245
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Zhuang Luying didn't get it.

246
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
All of this

247
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
was set up

248
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
to lure you to appear.

249
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
You've been hit by my incense.

250
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
Don't move.

251
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Otherwise,

252
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
you'll be the one who gets shot.

253
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
You're here.

254
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
How... How could it be you?

255
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Zang Hai,

256
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
so you

257
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
are Zhizi.

258
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,160
The person I've been looking for

259
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
is right beside me.

260
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
What are you talking about?

261
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
You're the one who's been looking for Ghostly Joy.

262
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Right?

263
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Ghostly Joy is my treasure.

264
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Of course I have to find it.

265
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Then you and Cao Jinxian

266
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
have made a promise

267
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
to find Ghostly Joy together.

268
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Right?

269
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
I did make a promise to him.

270
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
But what does it have to do with you?

271
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
I'm not going to let you go.

272
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
I'm not going to let you go.

273
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I'm not going to let you go.

274
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm not going to let you go.

275
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
I'm not going to let you go.

276
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Don't you always want to know

277
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
what's the secret

278
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
I've been hiding?

279
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Let me tell you.

280
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
What I'm carrying

281
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,160
is the grudge of the Kui family.

282
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Because I

283
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
am the son of Kuai Duo.

284
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Kuai Duo?

285
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
You were hiding behind

286
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Cao Jinxian and Zhuang Luying

287
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
and when they

288
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
joined forces to destroy the Kui family,

289
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
you never thought I'd live to this day.

290
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Zang Hai,

291
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
it's not like that.

292
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
You...

293
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Xiao An Tu,

294
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Xiao An Tu,

295
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
do you know what this is?

296
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Underneath that dress

297
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
is my parents' skin.

298
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
After they were killed,

299
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,160
they can't even keep their bodies.

300
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
I've swore in front of my parents' skin

301
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
that I would

302
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
take revenge

303
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
for them

304
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
if I had to.

305
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
I'm sorry.

306
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
I'm sorry.

307
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
I'm sorry.

308
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
I'm sorry.

309
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I'm sorry.

310
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
I'm sorry.

311
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Princess!

312
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Hurry!

313
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Princess!

314
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Hurry!

315
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Zhang Luoyi!

316
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Zhang Luoyi, how is it?

317
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
You must be familiar

318
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
with this scene.

319
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,160
If you don't hand over the items,

320
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
we'll kill

321
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
them one by one.

322
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Master, give him

323
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
what he wants!

324
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
The world is turning.

325
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
So that's how it is.

326
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Zhang Luoyi,

327
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
you're really heartless.

328
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
Then let's

329
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
torture them

330
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
so that they can

331
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
suffer.

332
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Even a dog like you

333
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
deserves to be

334
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
tortured.

335
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Dream on!

336
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Zhang Hong, Xiao Wu,

337
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
I'm counting on you!

338
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
I'm counting on you!

339
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Father, I'm late.

340
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Good boy.

341
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
Take Madam away!

342
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Take him away!

343
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Where's the letter?

344
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
The prince was suddenly attacked.

345
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
He didn't get the letter.

346
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Retreat!

347
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Retreat!

348
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Father, I'm fine.

349
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Call the doctor!

350
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Call the doctor!

351
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
Father!

352
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
My Lord!

353
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
My Lord!

354
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
The second young master's injury is only a bruise.

355
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
The doctor said it's a good thing he's not hurt.

356
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
You're hurt too?

357
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,160
I'm not injured enough.

358
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
My Lord,

359
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
I've almost recovered.

360
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
What we need to do

361
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
is to keep everyone

362
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
quiet.

363
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
We mustn't reveal anything.

364
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
I understand.

365
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
Come here.

366
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Come here.

367
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Do you know why Cao Jingxian

368
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
brought someone to kill him?

369
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Cao Jingxian

370
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
played this trick in front of everyone.

371
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,160
I'm afraid it's not only because he knew

372
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
that the Marquis wanted to impeach him.

373
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Last night, the court and the army

374
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
fought in the front yard.

375
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
The body of the court guard was left behind.

376
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
The fire was set on fire.

377
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Oh no, My Lord.

378
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Your copper fish...

379
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Don't panic.

380
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
It's not that easy

381
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
to kill a marquis.

382
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
But this swine

383
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
didn't come for the copper fish.

384
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
He came to kill the Marquis

385
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
for the ghost.

386
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
Ghost?

387
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
He's sure that the ghost is in the Marquis's mansion.

388
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
My Lord,

389
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
I suddenly thought

390
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
that it could be the young master

391
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,160
who told him about the ghost and the copper fish.

392
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
He told him about Cao Jingxian's tricks.

393
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,160
I've never told the Marquis about this.

394
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
How would he know?

395
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
My Lord,

396
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
during this time,

397
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
the young master was in close contact with me.

398
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
After he came to my mansion,

399
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
some drawings and records related to the ghost

400
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
were missing.

401
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,160
What?

402
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
I don't dare to guess.

403
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
But yesterday's matter was so strange.

404
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
The more I think about it, the more I feel something is wrong.

405
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Why did the young master suddenly get close to me?

406
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
And

407
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
what did he do with those drawings?

408
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
You and I both know

409
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
that the ghost is not here.

410
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
Why doesn't Cao Jingxian believe it?

411
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
My Lord,

412
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
I have a question.

413
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Please tell me.

414
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,160
You've been in the mansion for a long time.

415
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,160
What is it?

416
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
I don't know.

417
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,160
But I do know

418
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,160
that the ghost is in the mansion.

419
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
The ghost is in the mansion.

420
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
I don't know why.

421
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
I don't know what happened.

422
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
I don't know why.

423
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
You don't know?

424
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
I don't know.

425
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
But what's the secret behind?

426
00:35:50,160 --> 00:36:05,160
That black snake

427
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
killed Cao Jingxian.

428
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Di Interrogate.

429
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,160
The more you know, the better you will be.

430
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,160
But the House of Zhi has become a waste.

431
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,160
Is that what you want?

432
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Marquis, the Second Young Master is also your son.

433
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
He is the future of the House of Marquis.

434
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,160
As for why the First Young Master will be taken by Cao Jinxian,

435
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,160
I really don't know.

436
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,160
The Second Young Master is the future of the House of Marquis.

437
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,160
The Third Young Master is the future of the House of Marquis.

438
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,160
The Fourth Young Master is the future of the House of Marquis.

439
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Before Cao Jinxian and I fought to this point,

440
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,160
His Majesty must have known.

441
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,160
The most important thing now is how to explain it to His Majesty.

442
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,160
His Majesty must have been very concerned about this matter.

443
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,160
And Cao Jinxian will not tell His Majesty the truth.

444
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm afraid it's not easy to deal with.

445
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Tell me, will His Majesty only trust him

446
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,160
and not me?

447
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,160
The First Young Master has confessed to Cao Jinxian.

448
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,160
It's hard to change his mind.

449
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,160
As for this matter, I think

450
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,160
only you should ask for punishment first.

451
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,160
And ask for revenge.

452
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,160
And you, Marquis,

453
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,160
must show His Majesty your attitude

454
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,160
so that he can rest assured.

455
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,160
Yes.

456
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,160
To make His Majesty rest assured.

457
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,160
To make His Majesty rest assured.

458
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,160
To make His Majesty rest assured.

459
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Hurry!

460
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,160
Get on the bed!

461
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,160
My dear!

462
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,160
My son, don't scare me. What's wrong with you?

463
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
My lord, my lord.

464
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Calm down.

465
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.

466
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Calm down.

467
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
My lord.

468
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
What's going on?

469
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Speak!

470
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
My lord.

471
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Young master was too hurt.

472
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
He was paralyzed and had a fever.

473
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
He was scared last night.

474
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
He was scared and couldn't move.

475
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
He was a little confused.

476
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
Say it again!

477
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
My lord.

478
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
Save him.

479
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Save me.

480
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Save me.

481
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Can you heal him?

482
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,160
No matter what,

483
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,160
you must save his life.

484
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
Yes.

485
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Father.

486
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
Father.

487
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,160
Father.

488
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Don't die.

489
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Father.

490
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
I'm here.

491
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
I'm here.

492
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Father.

493
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
What should we do?

494
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Father.

495
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,160
You're injured.

496
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
Lie down.

497
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Zhixing.

498
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
You'll be the one

499
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
who will take responsibility

500
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,160
for the Zhuang family.

501
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
How can I take responsibility for this?

502
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Yesterday, you were in the fire

503
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
of the Marquis's Mansion.

504
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Zhiyong.

505
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
You're not only my good son.

506
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,160
You'll be

507
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
a good general in the future.

508
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,160
Father.

509
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
I have one more question.

510
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Yesterday,

511
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
why did Cao Jinxian

512
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,160
suddenly make it difficult for you?

513
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Don't ask.

514
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
One day,

515
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
I'll tell you.

516
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Heal him first.

517
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,160
I'll do it.

518
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,160
I'm here.

519
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
I'm here.

520
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
I'm here.

521
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
I'm here.

522
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,160
I'm here.

523
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
I'm here.

524
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,160
I'm here.

525
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,160
I'm here.

526
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,160
I'm here.

527
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
I'm here.

528
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
I'm here.

529
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
I'm here.

530
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,160
I'm here.

531
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
I'm here.

532
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,160
I'm here.

533
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,160
I'm here.

534
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,160
I'm here.

535
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,160
I'm here.

536
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
I'm here.

537
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,160
I'm here.

538
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,160
I'm here.

539
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
I'm here.

540
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,160
I'm here.

541
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,160
I'm here.

542
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,160
I'm here.

543
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
I'm here.

544
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
I'm here.

545
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
I'm here.

546
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
I'm here.

547
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
I'm here.

548
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,160
I'm here.

549
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,160
I'm here.

550
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,160
I'm here.

551
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
I'm here.

552
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
I'm here.

553
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
I'm here.

554
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
I'm here.

555
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,160
I'm here.

556
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,160
I'm here.

557
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,160
I'm here.

558
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,160
I'm here.

559
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,160
I'm here.

560
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
Ceremony at Jun Palace.

561
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,160
Sing the imperial song.

562
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
It's me, the king is me.

563
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
It's me, the emperor is me.

564
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,160
It's me, the gardening is me.

565
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,160
