1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We are the people of the world

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We are the people of the world

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We are the people of the world

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 13

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mr. Zhao

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You?

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you remember this?

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is the toy you took from your body

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think we can use the real mother to hold her back

10
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The situation in the past is not clear

11
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I dare not take any action against you

12
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
These years, I hide my identity from you

13
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm afraid your enemies will find that our relationship is not the same

14
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It will affect your revenge

15
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But now I can't keep hiding

16
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because you have already taken this step

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This time, I, Li Ying, will be with you

18
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Eunuch, please accept my offer

19
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry

20
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We finally meet

21
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I came back for a visit

22
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:35,000
To visit your dad

23
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
At the beginning of four years

24
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We planed to obs Beschизvery Nirm

25
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I investigated this case.

26
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But this case

27
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
caused a lot of public suspicion.

28
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I was framed.

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Only your father

30
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
stood up for me

31
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
on the court.

32
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Because of him,

33
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I was not only being tortured,

34
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
but also saved me.

35
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
At last,

36
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I was only

37
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
being imprisoned.

38
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
At that time, I swear

39
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
that I would be

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
rewarded for my crime.

41
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Later,

42
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
we had a long-term relationship.

43
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I was away from the capital.

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Many political affairs

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
were only through your father.

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And so,

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was able to leave the capital.

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
In the fifth year of the war,

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I returned to the capital.

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In the sixth year of the war,

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
your father

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
went to the east to build a fan base.

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
After that,

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
we never met again.

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But I still kept my letter.

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Three years later,

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I was in the capital,

58
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and I received your father's letter.

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He wanted to help the whole family

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
leave the capital.

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He asked me to take over.

62
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I thought

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Fengshan is still in the capital.

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He is no longer in the capital.

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I didn't expect

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
he would still be alive.

67
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Although he didn't tell me

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
what happened,

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but he kept a huge group

70
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
in the capital.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was still late

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to the end of the night.

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I was burned to pieces.

74
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All I could do

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
was save his son.

76
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I sent you to Qingquan Town

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
to make a big sacrifice for you.

78
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I want to raise you up

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
with a high-ranking star.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Thank you, master.

81
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is the last thing

82
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can do for your father.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Eunuch, thank you.

84
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You finally have a chance

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
after ten years.

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There are many things to do.

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
First, you need to figure out

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
whether there is a problem

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
with Shiyi Pavilion.

90
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I will send someone to the bow.

91
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I will go to the stone mansion

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to investigate the situation.

93
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Day 2

94
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I told you.

95
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The precept is broken.

96
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
When you went to the guest room

97
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I wanted to tell you

98
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that your credit card

99
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
should be remembered.

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
According to Consort spirit,

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
you are an illustrious top killer.

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I asked you to the house

103
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
côt for anycongratulation.

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,900
Yes.

105
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,920
Areyou that person who your teacher recommended?

106
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,260
Yes.

107
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,420
Well, master,

108
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,600
you can now tell me

109
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,040
how you get to know Eunuch Yuan now.

110
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,720
Okay.

111
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,080
Dong that guy

112
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,020
was known to Mr.noiff.

113
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
I saved him from Mr. Li's hand.

114
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
I'm different from him.

115
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
I was an orphan when I was a kid.

116
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
I grew up in a hundred families.

117
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Thank God, Mr. Li saved me.

118
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,020
I'll take the path I want in the future.

119
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
What about Master Liuchu?

120
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,020
I can't say anything about Liuchu.

121
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,020
Anyway, he's also a great benefactor.

122
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,020
I'll try my best to save him.

123
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Okay.

124
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
You can go now.

125
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,020
I'll take the path I want.

126
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,020
Okay.

127
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,020
I'll go.

128
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,020
I'll go.

129
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,020
I'll go.

130
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,020
I'll go.

131
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,020
I'll go.

132
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,020
I'll go.

133
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,020
You are my most trusted person.

134
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,020
You also know that in this world,

135
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,020
I dare to entrust my life to the trusted person.

136
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,020
There are few more.

137
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,020
That's the thing.

138
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,020
I am more important than anything else.

139
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,020
Anybody who ever comes to Τawai Island

140
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,020
can definitely go there first!

141
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,020
Whereev it is, don't saddle me!

142
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
Thank you for your time very much!

143
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,020
From now on, speak up to me first.

144
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,020
I have been just a person in charge of your life for 8 years.

145
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
Okay?

146
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,020
Now you have the emperor and Lord Zhao with you.

147
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,020
I believe that the day you get revenge won't be too far.

148
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,020
The situation is still not clear yet.

149
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
We can't lose faith.

150
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,020
Then you should be more cautious when you go to the stone house.

151
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
Even if you find that the stone house has some problems,

152
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,020
you must not act rashly.

153
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,020
Don't worry. I will protect myself.

154
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,020
Lord Zhao.

155
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,020
Please have a seat.

156
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,020
I will go to the wall now.

157
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,020
Lord Zhao.

158
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Lord Shi.

159
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
Lord Shi.

160
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,020
It's all the same.

161
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,020
Lord Zhao is with me.

162
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,020
Why are you so polite?

163
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
Lord Shi.

164
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,020
Lord Zhang.

165
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,020
This is the first time you come to my house after you have been injured.

166
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,020
I didn't expect you to be so polite.

167
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,020
You can also be a good teacher.

168
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Since I came to the court,

169
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,020
I haven't visited Lord Gou yet.

170
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,020
I am really sorry for you.

171
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,020
I have been working in the Ministry of Finance for a long time.

172
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,020
I came here for the sake of the sword.

173
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,020
I hope you can give me more tips.

174
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,020
Lord Zhao, you are so kind.

175
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,020
If you talk about the Bodhisattva,

176
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,020
who can be more than you in the capital?

177
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,020
I am an old man now.

178
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,020
I have been in the country for years.

179
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,020
I am afraid that I will be in trouble.

180
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,020
The Ministry of Finance is concerned about the money.

181
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,020
I have nothing to lose in the court.

182
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,020
If you lose it, it won't work.

183
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
I dare not.

184
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Lord Shi, don't say that.

185
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,020
You can't be so old.

186
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Besides the emperor,

187
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,020
no one is indispensable.

188
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,020
Zhuang Lu Yin is a good fighter.

189
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,420
Even so,

190
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,420
he is the watershed for the future son of Lord Gou.

191
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,420
This call makes things tricky for him.

192
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Is there anything wrong with him?

193
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,420
He is grateful to the god acting both preferences.

194
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:05,400
He is the best for the terminal final

195
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,400
I heard that the emperor gave you a sword to break your tongue

196
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,400
and asked you to investigate Cao Jing Xian's death.

197
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
You came to me today.

198
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Did you suspect the Inner Council?

199
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,400
The Inner Council's commander chose you to involve in many secrets.

200
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Do you really dare to investigate?

201
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Your Excellency, I haven't yet voted.

202
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
But the emperor can't be wronged.

203
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Since I have taken the sword, I will investigate it.

204
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
This case is very strange.

205
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,400
I just want to hear your opinion.

206
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
What do you think?

207
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Minister Zhao, you are indeed a good boy.

208
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
You are so confident.

209
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Maybe you can really use the Inner Council in the future.

210
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
He is still young.

211
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,400
He can't stand the anger.

212
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,400
He will come often to teach me.

213
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Please teach him well.

214
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
You are so thoughtful.

215
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I think you are a little bit of a person.

216
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Zhang Hai, you can let go of the case.

217
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
I will help you.

218
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Thank you for your help.

219
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
He is so cruel.

220
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
He even let us investigate the Inner Council.

221
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
He wants to take you as a knife.

222
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Which one should he cut?

223
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Ten elders will take the power.

224
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
But he won't be so bold to do these things.

225
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,400
And I can become the knife in his hand.

226
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,400
To promote the general of the Inner Council.

227
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
I have been with him for many years.

228
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,400
I have seen many ministers in the court.

229
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
He has been under the pressure of the case.

230
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
The list you gave him from the Heavens and Earth

231
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
was taken by him.

232
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
It was a big article.

233
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,400
And the capital and the Inner Council of the Cao Jingxian.

234
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,400
These years, it was also a political campaign.

235
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,400
But the attitude of the imperial court against Cao Jingxian

236
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
is much more than that.

237
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I am very similar to him.

238
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,400
I am like a hot-blooded weapon.

239
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,400
By the way, I heard that

240
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,400
the ten elders are the people who love to draw.

241
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
I just checked the master's room.

242
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,400
It is indeed a work full of valuable works.

243
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Some of them look familiar.

244
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
It seems that they appeared in the previous department.

245
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
I heard you say that I remember one thing.

246
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
The price of the paintings in the capital recently

247
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
has increased to one hundred.

248
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Instead of being too much,

249
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I have lost a lot.

250
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,400
It seems that these people who have received the paintings

251
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,400
have gone to visit the ten elders.

252
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Since the painting is his autumn house,

253
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,400
I want to visit the master again tonight.

254
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
I will send him a painting.

255
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I want to make him calm and lower his mind.

256
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
I will try to talk to him one more time.

257
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Master Zhang,

258
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
it is so late.

259
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Is there anything urgent?

260
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
I came here in the morning to visit the cemeteries.

261
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,400
This time, I brought the painting to the house.

262
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Please take care of it.

263
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Master, please follow me.

264
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,400
The autumn color of the west mountain

265
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
is bright and clear.

266
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
These two paintings

267
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
are all true.

268
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,400
I didn't expect that you would have such a good reputation.

269
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Master Ge, you are so filial.

270
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
You are a very clear-minded person.

271
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,400
I am just a rich and rich man.

272
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I have learned your art.

273
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
I came here to offer you a painting.

274
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I have disturbed your rest.

275
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Please forgive me.

276
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Master Zhang, you came here at night.

277
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,400
I am afraid that it is not just for offering.

278
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
It is so simple.

279
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I am not lying.

280
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I saw the painting in the garden in the daytime.

281
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
It is a very clear and clear painting.

282
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
The air is very fresh and clear.

283
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
It is very pleasant.

284
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
It is not only a good thing to have a good heart.

285
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I just want to take a closer look at it.

286
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Everyone has their own thing.

287
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,400
It is like I like to be single.

288
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Your Majesty likes to be in the harem.

289
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,400
My painting is a great painting.

290
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
It is not a traditional painting.

291
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Your paintings are my precious treasures.

292
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,400
You are very good at making people proud.

293
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,400
But I can see that you don't like it.

294
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Other officials are not in the mood to be in the harem.

295
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
It is not your wish.

296
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Your heart is not in the harem.

297
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,400
I am worried about you.

298
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,400
But I have something to ask.

299
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
What do you want to ask?

300
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,400
The case of the three courtesies.

301
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
You are a minister of the Ministry of Public Affairs.

302
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,400
You are not a person of the Ministry of Public Affairs.

303
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
But His Majesty asked you to investigate.

304
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Do you have any special thing I don't know?

305
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Master Ge, His Majesty trusts me.

306
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,400
So he asked me to investigate this case.

307
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Even if His Majesty trusts you, I can't trust you.

308
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,400
You have been in this position for a year.

309
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
It is really amazing.

310
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Tomorrow, I will tell His Majesty to hand over this job to me.

311
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,400
You don't have to worry about it.

312
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,400
If Master Ge can really convince His Majesty, I will do as you say.

313
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,400
You mean His Majesty is not only investigating the death of Cao Jingxian,

314
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,400
but also the death of other people.

315
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
You have to do it.

316
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,400
What do you think you should investigate?

317
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,400
The case of the three courtesies.

318
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Master Ge, what's wrong?

319
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Master Ge, something is wrong.

320
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Master!

321
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Master!

322
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Su Tian?

323
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Hurry, catch him!

324
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Go and get him!

325
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Go!

326
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Master!

327
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Who are you?

328
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Master!

329
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Master!

330
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Lu Yan, why did you kill Shi Yi Ping?

331
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
He deceived me into a trick.

332
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
He let us listen to his orders.

333
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,400
After the trial, he wanted to kill us.

334
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
He deserved to die.

335
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
But he deserved to die!

336
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
When Cao Jing Xian died,

337
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
the one who let you listen to his orders

338
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
was Shi Yi Ping.

339
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I should have killed you.

340
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
If you hadn't killed him,

341
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
how could you have become like this?

342
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Catch the assassin!

343
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Come here!

344
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Catch the assassin!

345
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Catch him!

346
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I'm sorry I couldn't kill you.

347
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I'm here to see you.

348
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Stop him!

349
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Master!

351
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,400
I searched the place where you could store things.

352
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,400
But I couldn't find anything.

353
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Master, what are you looking for?

354
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I couldn't prove it if I couldn't find anything.

355
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
No matter what happens,

356
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I have to report it to His Majesty first.

357
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Master!

358
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Master Song,

359
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
it's a serious matter.

360
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Please leave now.

361
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Leave now.

362
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Yes.

363
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Master!

364
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Your Majesty!

365
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Your Majesty!

366
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Your Majesty!

367
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
It's my fault.

368
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Your Majesty,

369
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
the treasure was found in Shi Yi Ping's house

370
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
in the mansion.

371
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Shi Yi Ping was killed by Cao Jing Xian.

372
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
He was not guilty.

373
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
He was known from his mouth

374
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
that the place where Cao Fu was stored

375
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
was all poisoned by Shi Yi Ping.

376
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
I didn't expect that

377
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
the person behind me was Shi Yi Ping.

378
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
My mansion

379
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
always misses my things.

380
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,400
I really lost my sight.

381
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
His Majesty sent me to the Nian Sword.

382
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
He even helped me deal with the third enemy.

383
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Now,

384
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
the treasure is also

385
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
to be handed over to His Majesty.

386
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Your Majesty,

387
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
I saw a painting in Shi Yi Ping's house.

388
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
I would like to give it to you.

389
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Which painting do you think of?

390
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
It's not a painting.

391
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
It's a painting

392
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,400
that shows the scenery of the mountain.

393
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
What's the painting?

394
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Take it.

395
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

396
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
I'll take my leave.

397
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Zhang Hai.

398
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Is Zhang Hai

399
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
all right?

400
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
It's fine.

401
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Miss Xiang is taking care of him.

402
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
These years,

403
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
he has a heavy burden in his heart.

404
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
He's a good person

405
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
to be at ease.

406
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Although he's a talented man,

407
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
he's still young.

408
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Yes.

409
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Do you think

410
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,400
he has handed over

411
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Gui Xi and Tong Yu to His Majesty?

412
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
What you mean is...

413
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
If he's done with it,

414
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
I have nothing to worry about.

415
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Are you worried

416
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
that he'll be saddened by His Majesty?

417
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,400
If he really left Tong Yu,

418
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,400
he must be like his father.

419
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I'm worried that His Majesty

420
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
will be at ease one day.

421
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
But it's very dangerous

422
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
to do this.

423
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Why are you up again?

424
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
You've been drinking so much.

425
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
You need to rest early.

426
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm not drunk.

427
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
What's wrong with you?

428
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Everything went so smoothly today.

429
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
One of my enemies died.

430
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
And I found Gui Xi.

431
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
But I have a doubt

432
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
that I can't go back.

433
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
What are you worried about?

434
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
In order to find the third person,

435
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
I've been looking for him for a long time.

436
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
He's a good man.

437
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
He's a good man.

438
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
They all hide

439
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
this man's identity

440
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
so deeply.

441
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
By today,

442
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
I finally have the chance

443
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
to face him.

444
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
But he died

445
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
in front of me suddenly.

446
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
If the third person

447
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
really has another lover,

448
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
he can let Lu Yan

449
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
use his own life

450
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
to play a role like this for us.

451
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
He also wants to hand over Gui Xi

452
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
and Tong Yu.

453
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Just to make us believe

454
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
that Shi Yiping is the third person.

455
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
If that's the case,

456
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
his city,

457
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
the strategy

458
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
will be far from Cao Jingxian

459
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
and Zhuang Luyan.

460
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
An Du,

461
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
come with me.

462
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
An Du,

463
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
come with me.

464
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Wait a minute.

465
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
You should look carefully.

466
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
This painting

467
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
is indeed

468
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
from the Winter Mountain.

469
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
The master and the housekeeper

470
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
told me

471
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
that this painting

472
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
was recently printed.

473
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
What does that mean?

474
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,840
Why did he hang this painting in the most beautiful place?

475
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,160
At first, it seemed like he was related to Gui Xi.

476
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,640
Did someone send him this painting?

477
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,480
And he wanted to make it look like he only wanted to attract my attention?

478
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,320
If that's the case,

479
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm sure it's this person who ordered Lu Yan

480
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,400
to hide Gui Xi and Tong Yu from the master.

481
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,800
I'm the real enemy of this bureau.

482
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,440
But Tong Yu and Gui Xi are the things he wants the most.

483
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,240
What did he give it to?

484
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,880
Maybe it's for the Tong Yu I have.

485
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
I see.

486
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,520
Although both of them are in his hands,

487
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,280
only three pieces of paper can open Gui Xi.

488
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,720
There's no need to do that.

489
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,360
Don't worry. Take a rest.

490
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,360
I'll come up with a solution.

491
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,080
I just have this worry in my heart.

492
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,000
I can't let it go.

493
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,720
I won't go anywhere.

494
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
I'll be with you.

495
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,920
Once everything is settled,

496
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,600
we'll leave the capital and have a good time.

497
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,720
You can't even believe Cheng Dong.

498
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,000
An Tu,

499
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
I have an idea.

500
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
What is it?

501
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
The resignation.

502
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,520
What's the matter?

503
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,820
I got the饵

504
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,780
from my職航官.

505
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,340
This is all for you.

506
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,460
I trust you.

507
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,220
Don't worry.

508
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,220
You'll manage it.

509
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,940
I'll be back with this.

510
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,860
I'm ready.

511
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,180
I'll find you.

512
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,420
You can keep theOOO!!!

513
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
OK.

514
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,940
아니에요 I'll call the roll.

515
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,580
It's nothing.

516
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,680
Smells good.

517
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,280
Don't, don't, don't.

518
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Why are you in a hurry?

519
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,240
It's not ready yet.

520
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,400
Where are you going?

521
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,480
We'll talk later.

522
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,600
Okay.

523
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,320
I'll heat the fire.

524
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,920
No, no, no.

525
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,080
No, no, no.

526
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,080
The porridge is called

527
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,640
small fire slowly.

528
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,760
You're on fire.

529
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,480
You have to be careful.

530
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,120
Okay.

531
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,320
当店ista

532
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,520
Have some lemon juice.

533
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,120
It's delicious.

534
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,040
Take it, take it.

535
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
It's hot.

536
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
It's delicious.

537
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,320
You feel better now?

538
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,120
Now that you've got a big revenge,

539
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,720
I want to talk to you.

540
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,720
So you're drunk again.

541
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,240
You're not in a hurry.

542
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,200
Master, it's okay.

543
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,120
It's all over.

544
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,880
So what are you going to do?

545
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm going to leave the capital.

546
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,360
Right? I've made up my mind.

547
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,200
You, me, Antu, Guan Feng, Shilei.

548
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,800
Antu wants to take Feng Liu's silver chain.

549
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,280
We can find a place

550
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,200
to spend a lifetime alone.

551
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,280
Of course, you're willing to do it.

552
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,160
Of course.

553
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,320
You're so good at the capital.

554
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,280
You don't want to be a governor anymore.

555
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,320
Then let's leave the capital.

556
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,520
I want to go back to Qingyuan Town.

557
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,920
Tell me about this.

558
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,760
I don't know if that guy is still there.

559
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,880
He's so sweet.

560
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,320
He doesn't want to be someone else's lover.

561
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,520
Let's talk about it later.

562
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
It's almost done.

563
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,480
I'll teach everyone to eat.

564
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,840
We need to talk about it with them.

565
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,040
Okay, go ahead.

566
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,960
Go ahead.

567
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,680
Your Majesty, Mr. Zhao is here.

568
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
Your Majesty.

569
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Binhuan.

570
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,280
I asked you to come.

571
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,200
I have something to ask you.

572
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,440
Your Majesty, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

573
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
Get up and talk.

574
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

575
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,520
I asked you, Shiyi is dead.

576
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,520
Do you want to be the governor of the Inner Council?

577
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,080
I've been in the Ministry of Revenue for many years.

578
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,160
I've been doing my best.

579
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,040
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

580
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,760
I hope you can think twice.

581
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,520
But there must be a governor.

582
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,280
You're my subordinate.

583
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,840
Who can do it if you don't do it?

584
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
If I can't share the burden for you,

585
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,280
I'm not loyal to you.

586
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,960
If you're happy,

587
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,560
I'll take the governor's position.

588
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,280
I'll take you to the governor.

589
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,400
Okay.

590
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,760
The governor is the governor.

591
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,200
You can be the governor of the Inner Council.

592
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,360
I won't let you down.

593
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,120
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

594
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,480

I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

604
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,320
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

605
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,080
I won't let you down.

606
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,740
You can finish your work.

607
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,460
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,480
Be 잘� những老皮儿,

609
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,980
Are you Ok?

610
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,040
Give me

611
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,740
恐怖者,

612
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,980
Don't make any cuts going on here.

613
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,000
Thanks.

614
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,380
Everyone network system is being reset.

615
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,940
And you can set orders for this.

616
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,080
It's not all right with me.

617
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,080
I am the one

618
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,080
