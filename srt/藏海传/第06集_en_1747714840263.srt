1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hey, hey, ha, ha, ha

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ha, ha, hey, hey

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey, ha, ha, ha

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ha, ha, hey, hey

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ha, ha, hey, ha, ha

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Imperial Concubine Li is in danger.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What?

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The late emperor is also in danger?

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I didn't expect this.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Didn't expect?

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Chu Huai Ming,

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
how did you do this?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The imperial witness.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't be angry, my lord.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The late emperor's coffin suddenly disappeared.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm afraid

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,780
there's something wrong with the

19
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,000
Imperial Concubine Li's coffin.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do you want me to ask the emperor for permission

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to take the Imperial Concubine Li back?

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
My lord,

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
maybe when the late emperor died,

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the feng shui had already gone wrong

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and left the coffin.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But the urgent thing is

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
we have to find a way

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to get this thing over with.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Get over with?

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sooner or later,

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
we have to bring the Empress Dowager's coffin back.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then we just need to say

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that the imperial coffin needs to be repaired

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and then secretly restore the late emperor's coffin.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But the imperial coffin is important.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I dare not make the decision without permission.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You still want me to ask the emperor for permission.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
My lord,

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you just solved the problem

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
of the Empress Dowager's funeral for the emperor.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you go to

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
repair the imperial coffin now,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the emperor will definitely think you are a good person.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But if you don't do that,

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
if the late emperor's coffin is passed on,

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll leave this to you.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You have to do it well.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But if I go to do this myself,

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it will attract others' attention.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm afraid I have to choose another suitable candidate.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This person doesn't just have to know

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the technique of watching the fish in the wind and water.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The most important thing is

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
that he has no connection with the people in the court

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
in order to avoid getting exposed.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
My lord,

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I have a good candidate.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Say it.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The new servant, Zang Hai.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The problem that Imperial Concubine Li had before

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
was solved by Zang Hai.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He is familiar with the imperial coffin and knows how to watch the fish in the wind and water.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now he is also doing things in the mansion and is a good person.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He should be the one to solve this problem.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Zang Hai.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What is he doing?

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
My lord, you have such an unparalleled talent.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a great blessing for the mansion.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is the right opportunity.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If he does it well,

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
he will be rewarded.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Shu Huai Ming.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Give him one more official position in the Imperial College.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let him go to the capital.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Remember,

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
don't say that he went out of the mansion.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes, my lord.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
By the order of the emperor,

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Zang Hai has been appointed as the Doctor of Zuo Ling Tai of Qing Tian Sword.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He is ordered to supervise the imperial coffin and hand it over.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Zang Hai has been appointed.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Congratulations.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Zang Hai.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Your eight characters match with the previous emperor.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You have the talent to watch the fish in the wind and water.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You have just entered the mansion.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You are so important.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You will have a bright future.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you, my lord.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Shu Huai Ming said that you are related to the previous emperor.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I guess they want me to bury the previous emperor.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What a vicious trick.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm afraid this kind of trick is not

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
a capable man like Shu Huai Ming.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Zang Hai.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You made Yang Zhen angry and forced them to do it.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You could only fight.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But they want your life.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I will disguise myself and go with you.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Master.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you go with me,

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
they won't kill me.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What I want is that they will attack me.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Once they attack, they will show their weakness.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then I will have a chance to win.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will only live after death.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You are too dangerous.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You should be careful.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Master.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Sit down.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It takes three months to repair the imperial tomb.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So I'm safe during this period.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I will be buried after the construction is done.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Master.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I need you to do two things for me.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:07:09,800
It's a mad night,

119
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
the Milky Way Orchestra's first yoyo is out.

120
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,240
Master, you haven't been able to use your skills for a long time.

121
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't you feel tired?

122
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Here.

123
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Put it here.

124
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Tie it tighter.

125
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
This one.

126
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,400
Here.

127
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Is it this one?

128
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Yes.

129
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Lord Chu.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Lord Chu.

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,200
Since Lord Zang has arrived,

132
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,800
we should help the court solve this problem.

133
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes.

134
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Zang Hai, what are you doing?

135
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Lord,

136
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
didn't you ask me to solve the late emperor's blood-sucking ceremony?

137
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Lord, please look.

138
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Please look.

139
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Where did so much water come from?

140
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
The late emperor's coffin ceremony

141
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
was made of the water.

142
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
The water is made of the ground water.

143
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,800
The ground water is like the tide,

144
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
the sun rises and the sun sets.

145
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:37,000
The golden silk

146
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
ized

147
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
by the sun

148
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
rises and the sun sets.

149
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
The light merges with the water

150
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,000
and strikes every corner of the chamber.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
The sound was heard

152
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
and was thought to be the late emperor's blood.

153
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,000
In the daytime, the rain stopped and the ground water returned.

154
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,000
The rest of the water in the chamber

155
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,000
slowly flowed from the door to the gap

156
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and flowed to the front hall.

157
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Finally,

158
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,600
the light naturally blocked the way.

159
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,600
If you don't believe me,

160
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,000
look at the height of the water on the wall.

161
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
You'll know.

162
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
The sun and the water

163
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
are all the same.

164
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
They are the same every day.

165
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Why is the water so clear today?

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,800
Don't you know that

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,400
the river was changed five years ago

168
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,600
and it was passed by the royal forest?

169
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,800
It's easy to say in the daytime.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
The river rises in the evening.

171
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
The late emperor's blood

172
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
is located in the deepest part of the royal forest.

173
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Once it rains,

174
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,600
it will be very dangerous.

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,400
But,

176
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,800
to put it back,

177
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
what kind of important place is the royal forest?

178
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,400
Even if the ground water rises again,

179
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
it shouldn't have so much water.

180
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Not to mention

181
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,400
the light can be lifted up.

182
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,200
Could it be that

183
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,400
after the transformation of the royal forest,

184
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
there is no process of increasing water protection?

185
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
What do you mean?

186
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,600
Lord Chu,

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,400
I am the doctor of the Zuo Lintai Department of Qingtian Sword.

188
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm just thinking

189
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
how to repair the royal forest.

190
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,200
Have you thought it through?

191
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
The change of the water

192
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
has caused the ground water to be rotten.

193
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,000
It's inevitable.

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
What we can do now

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
is to restore the lack of water protection.

196
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,800
Good.

197
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,600
Just do as you said.

198
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Repair it as you should.

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Listen carefully.

200
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
You must listen to Lord Zang's order in the future.

201
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,400
Yes.

202
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,600
Zeng Hai,

203
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,000
do your best.

204
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Once the royal forest is repaired,

205
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,200
you will have your own benefits.

206
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,400
Thank you, Lord.

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
It's been a long time.

208
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
It's not the late emperor's order.

209
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
People die like lights out.

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,800
Lord Chu,

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,800
what Wen Bozhi said

212
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,800
is just to comfort the future generations.

213
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
But there is one thing

214
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I don't understand.

215
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Please go ahead, Lord.

216
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
After the ground water is rotten,

217
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
there should be traces of water on the ground.

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It should happen often.

219
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
But no one has ever thought

220
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
it was caused by the groundwater.

221
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,400
It's not that no one mentioned it.

222
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,400
It's just that Lord Chu doesn't believe it.

223
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,600
And he was severely punished.

224
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
This person.

225
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,200
Ji Qun.

226
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Ji Qun.

227
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,600
Come and see Lord Zang.

228
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,800
Uncle Ji.

229
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Little slave.

230
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Uncle Ji.

231
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Little slave.

232
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
How did you learn to climb mountains?

233
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
I learned very well.

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,600
Come,

235
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,000
Uncle Ji gave you a good thing.

236
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
This is called a thousand miles of distance.

237
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
Climbing mountains with it

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
is a few hundred miles away.

239
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,200
It's right in front of you.

240
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
Ji Qun, you're back.

241
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Lord.

242
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,400
Father,

243
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Uncle Ji gave me this.

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Okay.

245
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
He was always bothering me.

246
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
He said he wanted to go into the mountains with you

247
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
and learn your ability to climb mountains and see the forest.

248
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
It seems that little slave

249
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,400
will be like Uncle Ji

250
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
when he grows up.

251
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,400
I saw your name

252
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,400
in the official book of Qingtian Sword.

253
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Many years ago,

254
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
you were the martial arts master of Qingtian Sword.

255
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,000
I heard from other officials

256
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,800
that you mentioned to Lord Chu

257
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
about the water in the forest.

258
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Do you know that the late emperor was transferred

259
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
because of this?

260
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,600
It's not the late emperor's order

261
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,600
that they said.

262
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,600
What the lords said

263
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
is what it is.

264
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,600
My miscalculations

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
are not important.

266
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,000
I didn't mean to offend you.

268
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
My lord,

273
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
he's just like that.

274
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Don't blame him.

275
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,800
The ash is burnt by the fire.

276
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
After it's formed,

277
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
even if it's soaked in water,

278
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,200
it will never get bad.

279
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,600
The ash is made of wood.

280
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,400
It's a piece of ash

281
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,200
and three portions of sand and soil.

282
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,200
It's mixed with glutinous rice.

283
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
It won't be damaged

284
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,200
if you don't beat it repeatedly.

285
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,400
This is the sand and soil.

286
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,000
Whether it's the water or the wall,

287
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
those who need to be water-proof

288
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,600
should wash the ash

289
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,200
and the thick paper

290
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
with copper and fish oil.

291
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,200
Then, use the ash water

292
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
to apply it on the paper.

293
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
After many years,

294
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
it won't be water-proof.

295
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,400
The ash is burnt by the fire.

296
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,800
It's a piece of ash

297
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
and three portions of sand and soil.

298
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,400
It's mixed with glutinous rice.

299
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
It's mixed with glutinous rice.

300
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,800
It's mixed with water.

301
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,600
It's mixed with water.

302
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,400
It's mixed with water.

303
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,200
It's mixed with water.

304
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,000
It's mixed with water.

305
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,000
It's mixed with water.

306
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
It's mixed with water.

307
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
It's mixed with water.

308
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
It's mixed with water.

309
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
It's mixed with water.

310
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
It's mixed with water.

311
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,640
So far,

312
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:19,960
ever since Qin Fang described ihre

313
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,440
About the clothes smuggling thing

314
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,560
Marquis is a man of decisive killing

315
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,680
No one can threaten you

316
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,960
No matter how much he likes you

317
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,200
he can't kill you

318
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,440
Don't worry, sir

319
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,480
Leave it to me

320
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,160
As long as you and Lord Yang

321
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,240
are in front of the Marquis

322
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,040
I'll ask him

323
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,080
I only know

324
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:12,240
the

325
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,040
Not only m Above the ants

326
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,680
a lot ofête

327
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,280
are afraid of the Dieserpeág

328
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,480
So I added bronze oil

329
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,840
and fish oil

330
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,160
A senior taught me

331
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,520
This is a long time ago

332
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
A friend of Qingtianjian

333
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,680
used this method

334
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,280
Later

335
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,000
no one used it

336
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,920
Why?

337
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,080
Maybe it's too old

338
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,960
and outdated

339
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,840
As long as it's a good method

340
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,760
it will never be outdated

341
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,280
It's just a different material

342
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,120
that you use to train it

343
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,960
You look like my friend

344
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,280
Who is your friend?

345
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,960
The former Qingtianjian witness

346
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,840
Guaiduang

347
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,200
I've been through a lot

348
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,840
I've never heard of his name

349
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
Where is he now?

350
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,760
He's dead

351
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,320
Just like a gust of wind

352
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,880
It's like a dust

353
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,400
that disappears in this world

354
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,440
without a trace

355
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,200
What a pity!

356
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,680
Istu

357
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,200
Where is your place?

358
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,840
Why do you

359
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,120
choose toG Safi

360
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:03,700
from a talented

361
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,780
master fights

362
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,360
穿镂至此

363
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,160
Master fight

364
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,400
is because

365
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,640
Its place

366
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,800
is the Mathematica fossa

367
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,440
And cover him to hide from the saboteur?

368
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,400
How about you?

369
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,240
You are very talented.

370
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,000
Why you fatalize Chu Huai Ming.

371
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,080
I don't strategy for him.

372
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,200
IНvitalize for myself.

373
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,200
The sun rises in the day, the moon rises at night.

374
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,200
The sky and earth are empty, the rain and stones are empty.

375
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Ma'er, Ma'er, this is a rare female.

376
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Don't let her smell it.

377
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Don't let her smell it.

378
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,200
What's going on?

379
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Your Excellency, this animal is scared.

380
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
It won't leave.

381
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,200
This horse is really extraordinary.

382
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
It lives in harmony with the people.

383
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,200
It's a good horse that can take on all kinds of people.

384
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Good horse.

385
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Who are you?

386
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
How dare you disturb the honor of the emperor at night?

387
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Are you blind?

388
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I do have a blind eye.

389
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Such a good horse is definitely not ordinary.

390
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
I dare not offend you.

391
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
I dare not offend you.

392
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
I've traveled the world and the sea.

393
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Today, I'm in the capital and I'm able to meet such a great person.

394
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,200
It's really an honor.

395
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I can feel the aura of a great man even from the carriage.

396
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,200
There are thousands of soldiers coming and going.

397
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
But in this carriage,

398
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
the hidden moon is full of evil aura.

399
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
It's scattered around you.

400
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,200
It seems that you've been in danger recently.

401
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
I'm afraid you have something bad.

402
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Your Excellency.

403
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Let go of me.

404
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
What are you talking about?

405
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
I dare not speak.

406
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Everything in the world is different.

407
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
There are all kinds of fate.

408
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
The higher your position is,

409
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,200
the more you are in danger.

410
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
You're so lucky.

411
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
You're talking nonsense.

412
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Believe it or not, I'll cut your throat now.

413
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Qu Jing.

414
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Ignore him.

415
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Go.

416
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Go.

417
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Go.

418
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
If we don't solve this problem,

419
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
we'll be in danger.

420
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
If we don't get rid of him,

421
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,200
we'll be in danger.

422
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Stop.

423
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
My Lord.

424
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Don't take the evil aura to heart.

425
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I'll let it disappear now.

426
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Bring him here.

427
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Yes.

428
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Taste it.

429
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
I'll give you the之後.

430
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Go.

431
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
What's wrong with you?

432
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Don't worry about difficult things.

433
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
My Lord,

434
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,200
many people backstory.

435
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,200
But,

436
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,200
many people story.

437
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
ел

438
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,200
I just want to tell you the truth.

439
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,200
I want to help you get rid of your worries.

440
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Why are you going to kill me?

441
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
What did you say before?

442
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,200
I'm surrounded by evil spirits.

443
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
I have a life to live.

444
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,200
You're a full-fledged liar.

445
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,200
I've been wandering around the world for years.

446
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
First, I don't care about the world.

447
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Second, I've been with you for a long time.

448
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Why would I say such an unlucky thing

449
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,200
to provoke you to burn yourself?

450
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Fine.

451
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
I'll give you a chance today.

452
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Tell me.

453
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
If you have a point,

454
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I'll let you go.

455
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
If you say a word wrong,

456
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,200
don't think about leaving here alive today.

457
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,200
I understand.

458
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
If you want to prove your innocence,

459
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
you can ask for a money first.

460
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
I'll come back after I've read the money.

461
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Money

462
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Sir, how much?

463
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,200
24,000.

464
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,200
The next one.

465
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,200
I see.

466
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Let me explain to you.

467
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,200
We live in the same house.

468
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,200
We're like four doors.

469
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
We have no place to go.

470
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,200
We're not at peace.

471
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Sir,

472
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
I'm afraid

473
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
you're in the way.

474
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
You're so concerned about the world.

475
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Explain it.

476
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Sir, think about it.

477
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Has anything happened recently?

478
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
The changes in the soil

479
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
are the signs of my fate.

480
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
The world is in chaos

481
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
and the officials are in shock.

482
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
If you don't care,

483
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble

484
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,200
if you try to harm the officials.

485
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Since you said you could help me,

486
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
what can you do?

487
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Please give me some charcoal.

488
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Please give me the money.

489
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Thank you.

490
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Please call the Empress.

491
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,200
The imperial envoy,

492
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,200
the new emperor of Beidou,

493
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,200
is here to take the throne.

494
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,200
The grand preceptor is here.

495
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Sir,

496
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,200
I've asked the grand preceptor to come down

497
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
to help you.

498
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Please burn this money

499
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
and wait for the good news.

500
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
What happened?

501
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Why did the money

502
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
suddenly burst out?

503
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Are you a man of fire?

504
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Fire is fire.

505
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Please check if there's any change in the money.

506
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
This money...

507
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Sir.

508
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
The money is gone.

509
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
It's gone.

510
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
It's gone.

511
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
It was 24 just now.

512
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Now it's 46.

513
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
There's really a change.

514
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
The 46,000 is the average money.

515
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
The signature says

516
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
the money is in danger

517
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
and there are disasters.

518
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,200
The money is about to be turned over

519
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,200
and the money is about to be burned.

520
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
The money is about to be burned.

521
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
The money is about to be turned over.

522
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
The star will rise from the sky

523
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
and the moon will be over the mountain.

524
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Congratulations, sir.

525
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
What's the good news?

526
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
The signature means

527
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
the star has already come down

528
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
to help you get through the difficulties.

529
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
When it's about to die,

530
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
it will show up.

531
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,200
You'll know then.

532
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
It's a miracle.

533
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,200
It seems that I don't need to solve this problem.

534
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,200
You'll have a chance to turn the tide.

535
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
That's great.

536
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I've tried my best.

537
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,200
You're lucky.

538
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
I've been told

539
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
that I'm harder than ordinary people

540
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
and more difficult.

541
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,200
I hope you can give me some money.

542
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Give him.

543
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Thank you, sir.

544
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
I wish you success

545
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
and a good luck.

546
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Sir.

547
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Thank you, sir.

548
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Thank you, sir.

549
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,200
The road is strange.

550
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
The birds and birds

551
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,200
are flying to the north.

552
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Today,

553
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
the noble lady

554
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
has passed away.

555
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
She's gone.

556
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
She's gone.

557
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
She's gone.

558
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
She's gone.

559
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
She's gone.

560
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
She's gone.

561
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
She's gone.

562
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
She's gone.

563
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
We met

564
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,200
in the temple.

565
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Sir.

566
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Please give me

567
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
the thousand-dollar fish.

568
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,120
Yes.

569
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,880
That's all for today.

570
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,640
Thanks for today.

571
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Thank you.

572
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,480
My lord.

573
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,760
Donald fan, please look forward to

574
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,300
our Followingделting battlefield.

575
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,120
In comes a banana

576
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,280
Stop

577
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,340
Okay

578
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,140
You堂 not right

579
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,420
You need to twirl the clockwork

580
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,640
with the leaves

581
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,700
Like this

582
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,100
Then we can use

583
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,320
But unfortunately, everything changed in treachery.

584
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,000
Kill an enemy force.

585
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,360
my

586
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,360
Everything is going well in the palace

587
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,560
If nothing goes wrong

588
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,480
the imperial mausoleum will be completed in time

589
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,760
Zanghai is really a talent

590
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,800
Zanghai is indeed capable

591
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,480
But recently

592
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,520
the late emperor's death

593
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,120
was still heard by the officials

594
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,040
These people are talking about everything

595
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,360
They say everything

596
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,200
These scholars

597
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,080
are always looking for trouble

598
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,240
Let them talk

599
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
You are wise

600
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,360
But this is not the most troublesome thing

601
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,280
It's bad that

602
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,560
it involves the eldest prince

603
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,800
Zanghai found out

604
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,040
that the late emperor's death

605
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
was related to the palace's construction

606
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,720
It was caused by the water leakage in the underground palace

607
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,800
I knew it was you

608
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,240
You are so famous now

609
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,760
How can you even see a newcomer?

610
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,560
Show yourself

611
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,800
It's not like that, father

612
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,400
Most of the silver used in the imperial mausoleum

613
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,120
was taken away by Eunuch Cao

614
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,640
as a gift for the emperor's restoration

615
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,440
You know it

616
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,440
What else did Zanghai see?

617
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,640
At the moment, he doesn't know the secret behind it

618
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,240
But he is a smart man

619
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,360
As long as he thinks about it, he will know

620
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,920
it has something to do with the palace

621
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,120
He is a smart man

622
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,360
He should know

623
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,680
what to say and what not to say

624
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,360
It's related to the eldest prince's safety

625
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,080
What do you want to do?

626
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,880
Let the imperial mausoleum be completed

627
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,480
and Zanghai is a great achievement

628
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,640
Let him bury the late emperor

629
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,760
It's the greatest honor for him

630
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,160
Mr. Wu has done it

631
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,560
You should be our T power

632
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,280
and he will be the best 250,000 recently

633
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,840
You should have made an agreement

634
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,440
I still dare to lie to you

635
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,720
Go

636
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,960
We'll do as you said.

637
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,280
See to it, there won't be any further accidents.

638
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,160
Yes, your Majesty.

639
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,520
Yes, Father.

640
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,640
Look now.

641
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,600
Brothers, the battle is over

642
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,480
Bravo!

Great!

644

Great!

645
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Great!

646
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
Bravo!

647
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Bravo!

648
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Bravo!

649
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Bravo!

650
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Bravo!

651
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Bravo!

652
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
Bravo!

653
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Bravo!

654
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,800

how do you know so much.

660
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,020
Is this also a part of your family business?

661
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,880
No..

662
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,820
it's because my parents died Captured

663
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,020
following a fancier

664
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,560

720
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,520

in the small Thyelarox

727
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
You're the only one who can cure my son

Please don't forget about my family

729

You're willing to die for the late emperor and the empress dowager

730
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
The court will give you a big sum of money

731
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
to comfort your wife and children

732
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280

I will never go back on my promise

740
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
No hurry

741
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
I have one more thing to do

742
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
Zang Hai, listen to my order

743
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280

745

and has worked hard to make a great contribution

to send the empress dowager to the mausoleum

750
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280

751
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
