La, la, la, ti, he, re, fa, la, la, la, ti, ti, re, fa, la, la, ti, ti, re, fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
La, la, la, la, li, lu, lu, la

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:23,820
Next Watch commissioner

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,960
Bye for now wonderful

5
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,880
that's it

6
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,160
Nice

7
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,960
it's a secret place

8
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,240
You can still find the treasure

9
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,960
after ten years

10
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
I forgot all about observe methods

11
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,120
that my dad taught you

12
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,880
I didn't study it

13
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:06,880
The place we are stepping on now is the hole my father took me to.

14
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,880
This hole is connected to the path of the forest, which is the closest to the Jin Gang wall.

15
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,880
When we left, my father had ordered us to block the hole to prevent the tomb raiders from entering.

16
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,880
The hole is blocked. Where did Master enter from?

17
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,880
My father has been in the East for so long, so it's inevitable that other tomb raiders will be watching here.

18
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,880
How about this? Let's split up and look for them.

19
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Let's go.

20
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Guan Feng, come.

21
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
The tomb of the Jin Gang

22
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Father, this is a tomb of the Jin Gang.

23
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Then, look if you can find the identity of the tomb owner.

24
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
The tomb of the Jin Gang

25
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,880
The coffin is so exquisite. The materials are also from the upper city.

26
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,880
It's not a normal coffin.

27
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
The tomb of the Jin Gang

28
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Why isn't there any tombstone?

29
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
The tomb owner is so weird.

30
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,880
The gold, jade, and jade are from the upper city, but there are no tombstones.

31
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Could it be that he doesn't want people to know his identity?

32
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,880
The tomb owner is obviously a royal official, and he's also a high official.

33
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,880
What kind of high official needs to hide his identity?

34
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,880
I think the tomb owner's tombstone is hidden in this stone coffin.

35
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,880
Then why isn't he being properly carved out, but hiding in a place that no one can see?

36
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Mother once said that he was a man of great power.

37
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,880
He was so powerful that he could defeat all the military officials and even assassinate people.

38
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
He's the former governor of the state, Liu Xian.

39
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,880
He's used to hiding his identity, so he's hiding his own identity.

40
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Then let me see if it's him.

41
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,880
It's really Liu Xian! It's really Liu Xian's tomb!

42
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Master, we've investigated the cave of Liu Xian's tomb.

43
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,880
It looks like it's been carved for a long time.

44
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,880
I think it'll be done in less than two days.

45
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,880
And the one we came in, we've carved out the path.

46
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Luckily, we have to die in the coffin, or else this place will be ruined.

47
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
They will definitely continue to dig.

48
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,880
You guys guard the tomb and take it down.

49
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Also, remember to fill all the holes with the stone.

50
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Everything here must be intact.

51
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Yes.

52
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,880
The Qing Tian Sword has the responsibility to repair and protect important tombs.

53
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
But you can't take the initiative to dig.

54
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Understood.

55
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Every time I die, you're the one I will part with, right?

56
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Looks like the pessoal strength of the grave will only Last this much.

57
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,880
I'm also a great role model.

58
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Is it a type of parting gift?

59
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,000
Find out more at w ugnggovernance.org

60
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,320
outrageous

61
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,520
All are wiped out

62
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,320
According to the Bhutan castle

63
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
There must have been three bandits.

64
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Some of them died under the trap,

65
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,320
and some died in the house.

66
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Then, have the things we're looking for

67
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
already been taken away?

68
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Let's look for them separately.

69
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
If you find anything strange,

70
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
tell me immediately.

71
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Okay.

72
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Let's go.

73
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Be careful.

74
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
What is this?

75
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Don't worry.

76
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
This is a memorial tablet of Liu Xian.

77
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
The tomb of Liu Xian

78
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
There's nothing in the coffin.

79
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Shilei, help me take it.

80
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
What... What is this for?

81
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
My father said

82
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
people of the Qing Dynasty

83
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
should treat every single bone with respect.

84
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Even if we don't get

85
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
what we want,

86
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
we should bury them.

87
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Before we leave,

88
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
we need to restore the light to the cloud.

89
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Why is my path reversed?

90
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
The tomb of Liu Xian

91
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Even the tomb raiders didn't notice.

92
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
There's another memorial tablet in the tomb of Liu Xian.

93
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
This dagger

94
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
was used by my father the most.

95
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
The handle of this dagger

96
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
was broken into a corner.

97
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
My father was so sad.

98
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
It seems that this moment

99
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,320
was the other side of my father's dagger.

100
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
But...

101
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
If this is a memorial tablet,

102
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
why did it

103
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
end up with a word?

104
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
The holy man's path

105
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
is closed once.

106
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
It's about...

107
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
people.

108
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
It's about...

109
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
the holy man.

110
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
No.

111
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
What's wrong?

112
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,320
So many words were scattered here.

113
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,320
But it left a single hole.

114
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm afraid that if we don't put it right,

115
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
there will be no chance.

116
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Which one should we put?

117
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
A word that can cover

118
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
the whole life of the holy man.

119
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Holy man?

120
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
I'm not Liu Xian.

121
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Look.

122
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
The content of this poem

123
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
is about a holy man

124
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,320
who cares about the people and the world.

125
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
The one who can say this

126
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
is not Liu Xian.

127
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
It can only be his master,

128
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Shen Yi Zi.

129
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Liu Xian can't be like Shen Yi Zi

130
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
who travels around the country

131
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
to maintain peace.

132
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
He can only use the sword and the method of assassination

133
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
at the top of the temple

134
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
to stir up disputes

135
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
and seek what he has.

136
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
What he can't figure out

137
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
is the word empty.

138
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
The holy man.

139
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
The word empty.

140
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
The holy man.

141
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
The word empty.

142
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
The word empty.

143
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
The word empty.

144
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
The holy man's way.

145
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,320
The one who can use the word to cover the whole life.

146
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
The holy man.

147
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Zhinu,

148
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
is this the thing that Master hid?

149
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
They can't steal it.

150
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
The thing that caused the destruction of the Kuai family

151
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,320
is this thing?

152
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Take it out and have a look.

153
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Zhinu.

154
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Be careful.

155
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Zhinu.

156
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
What is this?

157
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
This is not the thing we are looking for.

158
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
This is the bronze box

159
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
that my father made.

160
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Father,

161
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
haven't you always wanted to make this thing?

162
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Why are you not happy

163
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
when you made it now?

164
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
This bronze box

165
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
is the grandest of wisdom.

166
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Father has been looking for ways

167
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
to make it in the ancient books.

168
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
But when I made it,

169
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
I suddenly found

170
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
that I was too obsessed with the

171
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
technical design of it.

172
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
I neglected that

173
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
it was a weapon.

174
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,320
If this thing is in the hands of the villains,

175
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
the consequences will be unimaginable.

176
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Then hide it.

177
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Don't let the villains get it.

178
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Zhinu is so smart.

179
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Okay.

180
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Let's put it away.

181
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Let's find a chance to hide it

182
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
in a place that no one will notice.

183
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Since then,

184
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I have never seen this bronze box again.

185
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Until today,

186
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
I can see that

187
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
my father had already hidden it here.

188
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Could it be

189
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
the day he came back from the east?

190
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
No.

191
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
It should be the time when he

192
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
took me here.

193
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
But if that day

194
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Master didn't come here,

195
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
then why did he

196
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
go back from the southwest?

197
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Anyway,

198
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
my father didn't take away the bronze box.

199
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Then the thing he

200
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
took back from the east

201
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
wouldn't be here either.

202
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Go back on your way.

203
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
You don't have to look here anymore.

204
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Let's go.

205
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
The water is empty.

206
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
The water is empty.

207
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Hurry up and fill the tank.

208
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
The water is empty.

209
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
The drink from the east is a tribute.

210
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Zhinu,

211
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
we didn't get what you wanted.

212
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
What should we do next?

213
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
It's not like we didn't get anything.

214
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
This bronze box is very powerful.

215
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Compared to the fact that we poisoned it in person,

216
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
the chances are much higher.

217
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Then let's kill it together.

218
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
I can help you too.

219
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
No.

220
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
We just agreed.

221
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
You are my only family now.

222
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
I can't let you take the risk with me.

223
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,320
But I can't let you do such a dangerous thing alone.

224
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Guifeng,

225
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
believe me.

226
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
I have a plan to get out of here.

227
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Are you sure?

228
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
After I finish this,

229
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
we'll leave together.

230
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
We'll go find a place

231
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
where the mountains are clear and the water is clear.

232
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,320
No one will recognize us again.

233
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Zhinu,

234
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,320
you are much smarter than me since you were a child.

235
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Your plan must be a good one.

236
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
But you must promise me

237
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
to return safely.

238
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Don't worry.

239
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
There is one more thing I want to tell you.

240
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
Put this bronze box back in the box.

241
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
It's more convenient.

242
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
Let's go.

243
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Go.

244
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Go.

245
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Brother,

246
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
I have a letter for the man in your warehouse.

247
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Okay.

248
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
I'll be right back.

249
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Put it in the middle.

250
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Put the melon and the fruit on both sides.

251
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Steward.

252
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Master Zhang.

253
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,320
Are the shops in Xianhou ready?

254
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
They are.

255
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,320
They are waiting for the time to come.

256
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Okay.

257
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
You can go back to your work.

258
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Okay.

259
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Go.

260
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
I'll be right back.

261
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Dad,

262
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
I know

263
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
that you didn't do this

264
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,320
because you didn't want to lose this memory.

265
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,320
You really love this memory.

266
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,320
You don't want it to be a bad memory.

267
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
But dad,

268
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,320
I have no other choice.

269
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Now it's in my hands.

270
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
I will use it to kill Pingjing Hou.

271
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
For you,

272
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
for my mother,

273
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
my sister,

274
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,320
and all my brothers and sisters.

275
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Okay.

276
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Master Zhang.

277
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
What are you doing?

278
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
I was thinking about the time.

279
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
It's the 17th of the month.

280
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Everything is in.

281
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,320
There is wine and there is harvest.

282
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
So I moved the wine to the left.

283
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
It's precious.

284
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
When I was cleaning up,

285
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,320
I accidentally stepped on the incense and cleaned it.

286
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
You are so thoughtful.

287
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
You are so thoughtful.

288
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
It's my duty.

289
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
I will go.

290
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
My lord,

291
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
it's time to offer incense.

292
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Father.

293
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Everything is fine in the family.

294
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
The holy scroll is missing.

295
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
A few days ago,

296
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320
His Majesty rewarded Fu'er

297
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
and made a good deed.

298
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
You can rest assured

299
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
even if you are in a state of alcohol.

300
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
A few days later,

301
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
father passed away.

302
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
I will go to the forest

303
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,320
to offer incense to the ancestors of the Zhuang family.

304
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
I will never forget this.

305
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
I will never let you down.

306
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I will keep the castle

307
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
and keep the Zhuang family alive.

308
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Your Lordship!

309
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Father!

310
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Father!

311
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
Father!

312
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Your Lordship!

313
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Father!

314
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Father!

315
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Father!

316
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Father!

317
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Father!

318
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
Father!

319
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Father!

320
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Father!

321
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Father!

322
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
Why hasn't Zhi Xing come yet?

323
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
Your Lordship,

324
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
we have sent for him.

325
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,960
But he's not in the mansion since yesterday

326
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,160
I'm afraid he went somewhere

327
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,360
Why is there no sound?

328
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Wait for him to come back

329
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,440
and punish him

330
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,160
My Lord

331
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,480
My Lord

332
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,920
worshiping the Immortal is a family tradition

333
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,080
I think we should wait for the Second Young Master

334
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,680
to come back with the Eldest Young Master

335
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,000
Why should we wait for him?

336
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,800
He's a family man

337
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,040
I don't want to see him

338
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,880
The Second Young Master is not here today

339
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,120
and there are few people

340
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
The incense burner in the incense stove

341
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,600
is not enough to burn the incense

342
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm afraid the late Marquis

343
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,280
will not be able to

344
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,640
burn the incense

345
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,360
The late Marquis fought in all directions

346
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,680
and sold freely

347
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,480
I never believed in this

348
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,560
Even if there is a fire

349
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,960
it's not enough to burn the incense

350
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,800
But

351
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,480
why are you so nervous?

352
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,240
From now on

353
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,040
you just watch the incense burner

354
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,040
Is there a problem?

355
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,360
Marquis

356
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,200
Marquis

357
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,560
Lord Zang is always careful

358
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,880
He was just worrying about the layout of the ancestral hall

359
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,880
and chose the incense

360
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,280
What's the difference between the incense and the incense?

361
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,200
Marquis

362
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,080
This is the incense Lord Zang used before

363
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,840
I found that this incense is unusual

364
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,560
There is gold silk in the heart

365
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,760
So I changed this incense

366
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,760
Lord Zang

367
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,400
what do you mean?

368
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,920
Please forgive me, Marquis

369
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,760
Today we pay tribute to the late Marquis

370
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,880
There is gold silk in this incense

371
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
The incense is a fire and a fire-burning essence

372
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,720
It can dispel the spirit of the golden horse

373
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,280
I use it to pray

374
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,800
I hope the late Marquis will have a soul

375
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
and dispel the disaster and help the family

376
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,800
and protect the family

377
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,080
Zhuang Shan

378
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,840
Yes

379
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,200
Go and see the incense burner

380
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,320
Yes

381
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,600
The

382
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,320
If it's for the safety of the family

383
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,920
why don't you make your own decision and discuss it with others?

384
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,080
You have just forgotten

385
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,880
I am afraid that you will not believe the rumours

386
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,000
and will be annoyed

387
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,280
So I will make my own decision

388
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,400
Please punish me, Marquis

389
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,920
I am the Marquis

390
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,560
Otherwise, I wouldn't have made such a great contribution

391
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,600
Zhuang Shan

392
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,440
Marquis

393
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,240
Zang Hai is a strong man for the Marquis

394
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,920
You have broken his goodwill

395
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,520
You should be punished

396
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,360
I am smart

397
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,400
Go on

398
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,880
Go

399
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,520
Where is Qi巴克 if not in the alley?

400
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,520
I put it in and it disappeared.

401
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
It was only for an hour.

402
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
How did it disappear?

403
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
Someone found me.

404
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,520
But it's obvious that Pingjing Hou doesn't know.

405
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Did the maid throw it away as something irrelevant?

406
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,520
Or someone took it out and told Pingjing Hou about it at the right time?

407
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
You're back.

408
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Have some tea.

409
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,520
I don't eat sweets. You can share it.

410
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Thank you.

411
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,520
Have you cleaned up the public platform?

412
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
Yes, we have.

413
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,520
The public items have been separated by the maids.

414
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
The sacrificial items are also in order.

415
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
The manager came out to take the goods to the backyard.

416
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
He will take the car later.

417
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Okay, I see. You can go.

418
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Yes.

419
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
What are you looking for?

420
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Are you looking for this?

421
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
What's this?

422
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
It's a piece of gold.

423
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
It's a piece of gold.

424
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Are you looking for this?

425
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Why are you killing him now?

426
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
I saw my parents.

427
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,520
They were killed by Pingjing Hou.

428
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
As for the secret room under the mansion,

429
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
I was trampled on.

430
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,520
I still can't rest assured.

431
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Have you thought about how to escape?

432
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,520
I was planning to escape before the mansion was sealed.

433
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,520
But I didn't expect the manager to steal my incense.

434
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
If it wasn't for the charity,

435
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,520
I'm afraid Pingjing Hou would have found me today.

436
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,520
How dare a manager make his own decisions?

437
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,520
If Pingjing Hou had already planned it,

438
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,520
he would have waited for you to commit suicide.

439
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Have you ever thought that the person who made you kill Pingjing Hou

440
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
was himself?

441
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,520
In a few days, my father will be the heir.

442
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,520
I will first add the power to the mansion and then go to the garden to worship.

443
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
You should also prepare well.

444
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,520
I wonder why the lord asked me to move into the inner courtyard.

445
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,520
According to the rules, the staff live in the Sheren Mansion.

446
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,520
When Yang Zhenyang was the most successful,

447
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,520
he couldn't move into the inner courtyard.

448
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,520
The people who can sit on this table are the most trusted people in the world.

449
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,520
My lord, there are some rumors about the villains in the world.

450
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,520
I've heard a lot of rumors.

451
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
They are all baseless.

452
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Don't take them seriously.

453
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,520
These are not official drawings.

454
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,520
My lord, you mean that there are some things in the future

455
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,520
that you want to do for the young master?

456
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
He is loyal to you.

457
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,520
It's easy enough for you to get close to him.

458
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,520
After the test, you go to my study and get the medicine.

459
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,520
The Tibetan people can freely enter the study.

460
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,520
You don't have to go there anymore.

461
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
So Pingjing Hou is testing me.

462
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,520
He asked me to enter the library and the treasury freely.

463
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Just to lower my guard.

464
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Calm down now.

465
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Everything is clear.

466
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Pingjing Hou has many enemies.

467
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,520
You are his personal assistant now.

468
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,520
He just wants to see if you have any suspicions under the pressure.

469
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Don't treat him as a blind man.

470
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,520
And don't think that you can easily trick him.

471
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,520
If he dies, you will die too.

472
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
After killing Pingjing Hou,

473
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,520
I will be the only one who can live in this world.

474
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Come in.

475
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
My lord.

476
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,520
My lord, I have made a big mistake.

477
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
Please punish me.

478
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
What happened?

479
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,520
This is what I received today.

480
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,520
I'm afraid someone believed the rumors.

481
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,520
They want to threaten me to kill you.

482
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
I was too young.

483
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,520
I thought I could play tricks with you.

484
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,520
I can find this person in a day or two.

485
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,520
I don't want to do such a thing and make you worry.

486
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
But...

487
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
But I'm useless.

488
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,520
I've been investigating for two days and nothing came out.

489
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,520
I saw the three-day deadline on the fan was coming.

490
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
I'm afraid someone will come.

491
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,520
If someone really wants to harm you,

492
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
I came to report.

493
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Since this person can find me,

494
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm afraid he won't look for anyone else.

495
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,520
My lord, you must be careful.

496
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,520
You're not only afraid someone will harm me,

497
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
but also afraid that when the deadline comes,

498
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,520
I'll be fine and he won't let you go.

499
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
My lord, please forgive me.

500
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
I'm afraid of death.

501
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,520
But I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

502
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,520
You smart people are too thoughtful.

503
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,520
I told you,

504
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,520
don't worry about something.

505
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,520
Don't say just rumors.

506
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,520
Just say that you want me to die.

507
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,520
I'm afraid you can't count it.

508
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,520
These people who dare not even show up

509
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,520
can't kill me.

510
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,520
You're my confidant now.

511
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,520
They'll come after you.

512
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Remember,

513
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,520
since I'm your confidant,

514
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,520
don't keep anything from me.

515
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,520
Just say it.

516
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Thank you, my lord.

517
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Then this...

518
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Enough. Go back.

519
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,520
I'll find out about this.

520
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Yes.

521
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,520
I'll find out about this.

522
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,520
The End

523
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,520
Killing Pingjing Duke

524
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,520
is the only reason I'm alive.

525
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,520
Being blinded by hatred

526
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,520
can't be avenged.

527
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Even if Pingjing Duke dies in your first season,

528
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,520
you won't have a chance to fight in the second season

529
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,520
or the third season.

530
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
What do you mean?

531
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
If I tell you,

532
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,520
you have more enemies than Pingjing Duke,

533
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,520
what about the others?

534
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,520
I've been in the capital for years.

535
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,520
I know the mastermind behind the Kui family's

536
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,520
destruction of the capital.

537
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Besides Pingjing Duke,

538
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,520
there are two more.

539
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,520
These three people are going to take away

540
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,520
what your father brought back from the East.

541
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,520
So your enemies are not one,

542
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,520
but three.

543
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,520
The End

544
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Master, I found a copper fish

545
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
in Pingjing Duke's secret room.

546
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Copper fish?

547
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
I saw it from my father

548
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
when I was at the gate.

549
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
But in my memory,

550
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,520
there are three of them.

551
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,520
It could be one of them.

552
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Who are they?

553
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,520
One of them is the current head of the Ministry of Justice,

554
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Cao Jingxian.

555
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Cao Jingxian has the power.

556
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
He's always on the run.

557
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
He often blames himself

558
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
for harming the court.

559
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
He's always trying to get rid of the enemies

560
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,520
and make himself stronger.

561
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Pingjing Duke is a coward.

562
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
He kills people in public.

563
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
Do you know

564
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
why the officials

565
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,520
are all in the Duke's house?

566
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,520
Cao Jingxian took them away.

567
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
They live in the same house

568
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,520
and are in the same house.

569
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Who is the other one?

570
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,520
I've been curious about one thing.

571
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,520
The two people who didn't have any contact

572
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,520
are now allies in one night.

573
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Ten years ago,

574
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,520
Pingjing Duke returned to the capital from the east.

575
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,520
That night,

576
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,520
he and Cao Jingxian left their house.

577
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
The second person?

578
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,520
The Kuai family was in a state of crisis.

579
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
I think

580
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,520
they must have gone to see the third person.

581
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,520
But this person is too hidden.

582
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,520
I can't find any clues about him.

583
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,520
You just said the same thing

584
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,520
and verified his existence.

585
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Please tell me what to do.

586
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,520
If it were me,

587
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,520
I would give up

588
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,520
and wait for the right time.

589
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
I'm sorry, Duke.

590
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
I can't do it.

591
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,520
It seems that Gao Ming

592
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,520
didn't teach you how to hold your breath

593
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,520
and make you so confused.

594
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,520
You have high standards.

595
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,520
For the sake of the Pingjing,

596
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,520
I've been fighting for ten years.

597
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,520
I thought I was close to success.

598
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
I could have won ten years

599
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,520
in the last game.

600
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
But now,

601
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
I can't get his trust

602
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,520
and I have two enemies.

603
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,520
Every night in my dreams,

604
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,520
I see the night that my parents longed for.

605
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,520
I live in this world

606
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
and I'm always in the best shape.

607
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
I don't want them to be too angry.

608
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,520
But I'm not afraid of the party.

609
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,520
I can't take revenge

610
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,520
even if I live my life in poverty.

611
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
You can use your strength

612
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,520
to take the opportunity.

613
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
But after Pingjing's death,

614
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,520
the other two will know

615
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,520
that you can't get close to them again.

616
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,520
You killed him

617
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,520
and succeeded in your life

618
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,520
but you're still a nobody.

619
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,520
You should be proud of yourself.

620
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
Come on.

621
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,520
Come on.

622
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Come on.

623
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,520
I'm the one.

624
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,520
I'm Yu Duo.

625
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
When the sun rises,

626
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,520
I'm the one.

627
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
When the army attacks,

628
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,520
I'm the one.

629
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,520
I'm the one.

630
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,520
The world is me.

631
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,520
The world is me.

632
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,520
You are me too.
