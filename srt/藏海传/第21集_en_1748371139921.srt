00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,160
Episode 36

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:47,560
The

3
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,740
My Lord.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Why did clothes get curd?

5
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,260
It's mix-with-cомуke

6
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,600
So good

7
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,300
La tears

8
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,640
È

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't blame yourself

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This house

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
was given to me by His Majesty many years ago

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now it's hard to avoid some broken wine

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Even for such a thing

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you have to trouble Magistrate Zhao

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's the duty of the Silver and Food Department

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I didn't report to the court

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How can I lose my job?

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Be careful, Your Highness

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Be careful

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I heard you have a lot of research on architectural magic

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm quite satisfied

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You even clean up the work of repairing the house and the house

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm flattered

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Follow me

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Magistrate Zhao

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You don't have to look at it

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I know

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You didn't cause the problem

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But Chu Huai Ming is dead

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No matter how the account book is

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the money of the corruption can't be recovered

33
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Please investigate it

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I do

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm just a judge

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I only know to look down

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know to look up

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm afraid I don't even know to hit the wall

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What do you mean?

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Inner Council received many reports of your participation these days

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you know how many people were offended by it?

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So many people wanted to participate in my work

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But I was not affected at all

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I think

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
maybe the reports are all

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the endless curses

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No matter if what they said is reasonable

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the officials are always invited to participate in my work

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
When the reports are piled up

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
they are considered guilty even if they are not guilty

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You are right

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But I have a question

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
In your opinion

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
the officials

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
can only cheat the officials

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
for those obvious unfair things?

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The water is clear

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
but not the man's

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The man's intelligence is not clear

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you are just a piece of stone

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
you can be a good man

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You are fast

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a good way to stand out in the official field

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But if you are thinking about the top

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
you will make a big mistake

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't understand

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please give me some advice

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You are recommended by Marquis Pingjing

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You are young

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and you are a high ranking witness

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So you don't understand many things

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You want to make Qingtianjian a good place

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are right

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But don't forget

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Qingtianjian did a lot of things

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
for the sake of the royal family and the state

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No matter what kind of person

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
or how big the official is

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
as long as their actions

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
are against the law of Dayong

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I am not afraid to offend them

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will continue to investigate

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I ask for your help

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
to punish them one by one

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The cabinet has received your list

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are a brave man

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You investigate first and then investigate

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
who was killed and who was released

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Some things seem to be superficial

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't know how many cases are being debated in the back

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You are so reckless

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
to stir up the pool of water

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Have you ever thought

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
how many people are involved in the chaos?

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's exactly what I want

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If there are some people

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
who are well-known in the court

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the list will not cause any trouble

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But if they think they can

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
use this list to make a big article

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
to make a contribution to each other

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If this list is not successful

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
who will do this good deed

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to punish the evil for the court?

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If we can cooperate

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to clear up the sects

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and use the power to fight

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
we can stop it

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I will stop it

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You are in your position

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's reasonable to make such a low plan

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm afraid

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
it's not what Pingjing Hou means

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Otherwise, Chu Huai Ming would have done this

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
when he was here

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You voted for him

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
just for this day?

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Then I will say one more thing

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The court is in danger

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Before we do anything

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
we should sit down

122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
To make a good plan

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
we should protect ourselves first

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Because the higher the position

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the more things we can do

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Before we can make sure

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
what you want to do

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
we should go to that position first

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm flattered

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
As for the bill

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
we should take it as a warning

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's not shoes

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We should go to that position first

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
How could it be so говорить?

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And I can't leave

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I won't come back

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,480
I've been living here for years

138
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,120
Since you're here

139
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,200
help me to repair the tiles outside

140
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,160
Is it okay?

141
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,880
Don't worry, sir

142
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,960
Master

143
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
I'm going to binary

144
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,840
so as to make the eunuch happy

145
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,880
These tiles are a little rotten

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Yes, we're going to the ne성ive green pool in the garden House to wait for them

147
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,760
Yitian wants to stay a year

148
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,940
Yitian is interested in this

149
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,940
Come, Yitian

150
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,060
Is there anything I can do for you?

151
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,900
Can I tell you?

152
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,220
Did you bring the silkworms from the Department of Justice?

153
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,900
I left them in the study

154
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,220
without your permission

155
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,700
Go back to the house

156
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,500
Master, be careful

157
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,660
Where is Tang Hai?

158
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,780
Master

159
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,300
Master asked me to get the tools

160
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
They were still here just now

161
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:47,740
Prophet

162
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,060
What are you doing here?

163
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,820
along with a morning walk

164
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,340
andicz of it

165
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:05,180
together with my wedding

166
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,020
azy

167
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,140
Lu brunch

168
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,300
Cheng warm soup

169
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,860
By the way, let's sleep

170
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,380
Sure

171
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,900
Jiang

172
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,060
How's that

173
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,060
So what

174
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,220
I've been here

175
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,100
and tried to fix it

176
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,060
I didn't ask for your opinion

177
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,420
I was too reckless

178
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,620
I'm sorry for your trouble

179
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,980
But the study contains

180
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,260
the state secrets and important details

181
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,980
If you come in

182
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,860
and see something

183
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,140
or do something

184
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,700
it's hard to say

185
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,300
You said

186
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,060
a private brought you in

187
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,380
Where is he?

188
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,740
When I went in

189
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,580
he was still outside

190
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,340
Brother

191
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:24,940
Yes

192
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,140
Call all the private here

193
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,060
and ask them to identify him

194
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,300
See who brought him here

195
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Once we find out

196
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,660
we'll be punished

197
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,020
Yes

198
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,260
Delicious

199
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,620
Thanks

200
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,820
Master. They are all here

201
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,140
Minister

202
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,900
what are you there for?

203
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,240
Why on earth were you here?

204
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,200
Did you find it?

205
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,120
Your excellency

206
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,880
I was since we first met

207
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,620
and I couldn't remember

208
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,040
It doesn't matter

209
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,360
You don't remember her

210
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,600
but she must remember you

211
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,660
Who of you saw this official today?

212
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,660
Who said the study was cold?

213
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,620
He is here to see you

214
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,700
Since you don't admit it

215
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,220
you will be punished together

216
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:58,620
Master

217
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,420
Master

218
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,060
Master

219
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,020
My lord

220
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,980
that servant is kind

221
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,900
Since you said so

222
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,380
who said it?

223
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,540
I promise I won't be punished

224
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,540
But

225
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,420
to be honest

226
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,100
these people have been with me for many years

227
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,740
and they know the rules of the mansion

228
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,140
If you lie to me

229
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,340
there will be no such person

230
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,300
Lord Zang, why are you here today?

231
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,220
If you can't make it clear

232
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,380
I'm afraid we will

233
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,180
have to go somewhere else

234
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,180
Dad

235
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,660
I asked him to come

236
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,980
Dad, your study is like this

237
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,740
I always feel cold

238
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,300
and you have a headache

239
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,500
Since Lord Zang said

240
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,020
he is a witness

241
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,900
I invited him here

242
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,380
I just left

243
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,460
and heard you scold the servants

244
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,540
and make such a fuss

245
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,740
You invited him to come?

246
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,100
He said she was a concubine

247
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,500
Dad

248
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,820
I came from outside

249
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,860
I should be the man

250
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,440
but he

251
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,780
recognized me as a concubine

252
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,540
Should I be punished?

253
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,540
Please forgive me

254
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,780
I did make a mistake

255
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,180
He did make a mistake.

256
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,220
Did you really teach him to come here?

257
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,220
I've never met him.

258
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,020
Why would I lie about him?

259
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,060
It was a misunderstanding.

260
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,100
In that case,

261
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,380
fix the study.

262
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,460
Zhao Gang.

263
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,220
Master.

264
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
Keep Lord Zang company.

265
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,780
Yes.

266
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,220
It's really the 20th of August, the ninth year.

267
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,540
It was before my family was killed.

268
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,260
Zhao Bingwen was a foreign minister.

269
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,220
The court ordered him to go to Yuezhou to help the disaster.

270
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,220
So the night when Zhao Bingwen was killed in your family

271
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,980
was not in the capital at all.

272
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,580
That's right.

273
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,580
Yuezhou is far from the capital.

274
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,500
It takes about 20 days

275
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,260
to come and go.

276
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,780
Be cautious.

277
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,020
I'll check the local restrictions.

278
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,660
If we can counteract,

279
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,340
Zhao Bingwen wouldn't be the third person.

280
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,180
The clues are broken again.

281
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,060
It's not that we have no gains.

282
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
You know that

283
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,700
the eighth son of Miss Xiang

284
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,380
is the daughter of the minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

285
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,340
The children of the rich are different.

286
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,380
They don't stay at home

287
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,900
and go to the station to be the uncle.

288
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,140
If my father is the minister of the Ministry of Revenue,

289
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,940
I wouldn't do anything all day.

290
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,420
I would go to the east to earn money.

291
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,860
I would take money from others every day.

292
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,380
What would it feel like?

293
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,580
Master.

294
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,700
Wake up. Don't dream.

295
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,100
But I have a favor to ask.

296
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,580
When you were running the study,

297
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,860
did you see any rare drawings?

298
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,700
I want to send them to you.

299
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,060
As a token of gratitude.

300
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,940
Drawings?

301
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,940
I have some old friends

302
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,380
who have collected a lot.

303
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,900
But don't you think you've got the wrong person?

304
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,020
You and the eighth son are not friends.

305
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,580
Why should they help you?

306
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,340
Think about it.

307
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,420
You are so knowledgeable.

308
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,460
I haven't found the painting of Han Qin Lake.

309
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,260
Thanks to the eighth son for solving the problem

310
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,140
in front of Mr. Zhao that day.

311
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,820
I sent some paintings today

312
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,100
to thank you.

313
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,500
You're welcome.

314
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,460
I didn't expect

315
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,260
the eighth son of the whole building

316
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,540
is the daughter of the Zhao family.

317
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,180
What?

318
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,860
The daughter of the Zhao family

319
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,940
is the daughter of the Wangyue Pavilion?

320
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,180
I didn't mean that.

321
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,100
But you can go to the world

322
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,700
and tell the world

323
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,220
to the people as a storyteller.

324
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,020
I admire you.

325
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,100
Okay.

326
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,900
I'll take the painting.

327
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,740
I'll talk about it tonight.

328
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,060
I have to go and prepare it.

329
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,020
Mr. Zang.

330
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,740
Go and talk about business.

331
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,820
Boss Xiang.

332
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,140
Mr. Zang, you're here.

333
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,900
I said goodbye to you that night.

334
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,220
I didn't have time to see you.

335
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,660
Come up and talk.

336
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,420
Boss Xiang.

337
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,220
You drank all the wine.

338
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,740
Have a cup of tea.

339
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,900
I've made a lot of tea for you.

340
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,140
I wish you would remember it.

341
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,900
worried about me.

342
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,580
We've seen?"

343
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,660
Wang Yue Pavilion

344
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,180
with numerous guests,

345
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,340
but at first,

346
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,780
we couldn't even afford the tea.

347
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,420
We're years late

348
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,140
now.

349
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,180
The pig's head

350
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,260
isn't ready yet.

351
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,660
Are you able

352
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,900
to light the lamp...?

353
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,860
Thank you for your help that night.

354
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,860
You've paid off the debt of the Gu Bi.

355
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,860
But I've always been curious.

356
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,860
Why did you go to see the drunk Prince Yongrong that night?

357
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,860
I went to take back my Gu Bi.

358
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,860
It's a good thing.

359
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,860
If it's just the Gu Bi,

360
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,860
why did you ask the Prince Yongrong about it?

361
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,860
What did Yongrong say?

362
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,860
He said there was a woman who asked him something.

363
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,860
But he didn't remember what she asked.

364
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,860
A person who wants to take back his Gu Bi

365
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,860
won't talk to the Prince.

366
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,860
Boss Xiang, you must have a lot of secrets.

367
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,860
Only Lord Zang can have secrets?

368
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,860
I can't have secrets?

369
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
You want to know?

370
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,860
I'll use yours to exchange.

371
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,860
To be honest,

372
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,860
I have the biggest advantage.

373
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,860
I'm a man of my word.

374
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,860
I won't ask anything that shouldn't be asked.

375
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
Fine.

376
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,860
What did you give the Prince just now?

377
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,860
You want to know?

378
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
I'll use your secret to exchange.

379
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
You...

380
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,860
Just these drawings.

381
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,860
I didn't expect him to like them.

382
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,860
And he said he would talk about this tonight.

383
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
I'm curious.

384
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,860
I want to see how the drawings are going to be.

385
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,860
Do you want to hear it together?

386
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,860
I might be busy for a while.

387
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,860
I'll come back to check when I'm done.

388
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,860
Whatever.

389
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,860
Lord Zang, don't tire yourself out.

390
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,860
Let's go.

391
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,860
The court is now in session.

392
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,860
His Majesty is writing a memorial at Hanzhang Hall today.

393
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,860
He's not coming to the court.

394
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,860
My lords,

395
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,860
do you have anything to report today?

396
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,860
I have something to report.

397
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
What is it?

398
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,860
According to the spring round, it's been less than half a year.

399
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
The Ministry of Rites has calculated

400
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,860
that the government needs to pay 100,000 taels of silver.

401
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,860
The government needs to pay 100,000 taels of silver.

402
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,860
The government needs to pay 100,000 taels of silver.

403
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,860
The cabinet has submitted a bill of payment a month ago.

404
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,860
But it hasn't been approved.

405
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,860
You don't know that.

406
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,860
This bill of payment has been on the budget of Hanzhang Hall.

407
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,860
It's not on purpose.

408
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,860
But this year, the Ministry of Works has built bridges and built roads.

409
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,860
The Ministry of Revenue has been in crisis.

410
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
The national treasury is empty now.

411
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,860
All six ministries are asking for money.

412
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,860
If we really need to spend 100,000 taels of silver,

413
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,860
why don't we give three years of the first trial to five years of the second trial?

414
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,860
We can share the burden for the court.

415
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,860
The imperial examination will be delayed for two years.

416
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,860
I'm afraid it will affect the election of the government.

417
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,860
You're thinking too much.

418
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,860
The Ministry of Rites can recommend the election of the government.

419
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,860
I think we can recommend it.

420
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,860
Just like Mr. Zang, who just took office recently.

421
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,860
Isn't he also recommended by the Marquis?

422
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,860
Thank you for your compliment, Eunuch Cao.

423
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,860
The supervision of the Imperial Examination must be based on talent.

424
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
It's not something that can be chosen by science.

425
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,860
It's hard to find a horse that can travel a thousand miles.

426
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,860
The task of the six ministries is to find Mr. Shi.

427
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,860
Since the Marquis said so,

428
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,860
what do you think, Mr. Shi?

429
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,860
The Ministry of Rites is responsible for the examination.

430
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,860
The Ministry of Rites is not in charge.

431
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,860
We will discuss this matter with the Inner Council.

432
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,860
Mr. Wang, why don't you write a new report

433
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,860
to see if the expenses can be reduced?

434
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,860
Do you have anything else to report?

435
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,860
Since there is nothing to report,

436
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,860
I will pass on an edict for His Majesty.

437
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,860
General Fu Zhisong has protected the land and people.

438
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,860
His Majesty thinks that he has done a good deed.

439
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,860
He has specially granted General Fu to die with the deceased in the late emperor's tomb.

440
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,860
To show his gratitude.

441
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,860
Before, the funeral was held in the imperial mausoleum.

442
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,860
His Majesty is very satisfied with the funeral.

443
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,860
In my opinion, General Fu's funeral

444
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,860
should be handed over to the Qingtian Sword.

445
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,860
The time is two months.

446
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,860
It should be more than enough.

447
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
I accept the edict.

448
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
His Majesty's edict is that

449
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,860
if the Ministry of Revenue can make 30,000 taels of silver,

450
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
the capital will be used to build the border.

451
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
I accept the edict.

452
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,860
I accept the edict.

453
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
Thank you, my lords.

454
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,860
Let's call it a day.

455
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,860
The Emperor's Tomb

456
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,860
Normally, the palace is buried.

457
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,860
Only the official and official are used.

458
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,860
The official is used as the official.

459
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,860
But General Fu has a high salary.

460
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,860
His Majesty allows him to be the official.

461
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
It is difficult to find a way to find a way.

462
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Yes, my lord.

463
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,860
I understand.

464
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,860
Shixuan,

465
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,860
the Qingtian Sword Department has been busy with work lately.

466
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,860
Only you can help me.

467
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,860
I'll leave the ceremony to you.

468
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,860
You must be careful.

469
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,860
Don't worry, my lord.

470
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Why are these craftsmen so young?

471
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,860
They are not trained by power,

472
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,860
but by experience.

473
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,860
The older the craftsman, the more skilled he is.

474
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,860
These people are too young.

475
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,860
If so,

476
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,860
I'm afraid the work will be delayed.

477
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,860
You're right.

478
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,860
In the past,

479
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
all the craftsmen who were buried

480
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,860
were sent from the Ministry of Works.

481
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,860
They were the most skilled.

482
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
But for some reason,

483
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,860
they were sent by the young.

484
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,860
What's going on?

485
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
My lord.

486
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,860
How did you do it?

487
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
This is the only craftsmanship left in the Ministry of Works.

488
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
My lord, please forgive us.

489
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
We didn't mean to do it.

490
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Please forgive us.

491
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,860
My lord, please forgive us.

492
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
It's useless

493
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,860
to do it like this.

494
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
Why did he come��?

495
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
We were led.

496
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,860
He didn't want to be involved in this.

497
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,860
We can't leave him to Milady Yu 시청.

498
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,860
She is our negotiation partner,

499
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,860
while little Brotherจะ bahaciḷkă.

500
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,860
She must take the rose anyway.

501
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
Do think about soumenoniushkyi,

502
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,860
or though Aer produkts

503
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,860
are superior to controlling the Recruitment of my Transaction Hall.

504
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,860
What can I do?

505
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:18,120
The

506
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,200
General Diao Xiu's tomb

507
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,800
needs a lot of experience

508
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Without a master

509
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,720
I'm afraid it's hard to hand it over

510
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,720
Fortunately, the Ministry of Works is here

511
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm here

512
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,960
to ask for a favor

513
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,480
Please help

514
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,280
A favor?

515
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,640
I'm afraid it's also a matter of person

516
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,400
You come to me for a discussion

517
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,640
But you sent me a letter first

518
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,040
It seems

519
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,920
you don't take me seriously

520
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,640
Do you think I'm the best person?

521
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,360
If so

522
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,280
I'll do it for you

523
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,280
You want me, right?

524
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,720
What a coincidence

525
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,880
It's cold

526
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,920
The workers are sent to repair the palace

527
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,080
I have no money and no one

528
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,720
How can I help you?

529
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,480
My lord

530
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,440
You may not know

531
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,680
General Fu's funeral

532
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,760
is related to the important task

533
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,640
of the Marquis

534
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,240
If it's not done well

535
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,400
I'm afraid

536
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,640
it will be a big mistake for the Marquis

537
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,960
My father?

538
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,360
It has nothing to do with my father

539
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
My lord

540
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,880
The task given by the Marquis

541
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,120
makes me keep it from others

542
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,880
If you don't believe me

543
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,000
you can go back and ask the Marquis

544
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
But if you miss it

545
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,840
we can't afford it

546
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,680
Since it's the family affair

547
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,200
I'll help you

548
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,000
You guys

549
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,360
Go out

550
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,560
Yes

551
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,080
What if

552
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
It's not like we have no way out

553
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Tell me

554
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
How many people do you need?

555
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Forty

556
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Forty?

557
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,680
I don't think it's enough

558
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,680
His Majesty values General Fu

559
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
The powder should be repaired quickly and well

560
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,680
How about this? I'll give you eighty people

561
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Of course

562
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
I don't need so many people

563
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
You mentioned eighty people

564
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
I'll give you forty people

565
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
I promise you won't delay the work

566
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,680
I won't take the rest forty people

567
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
As for the extra money

568
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,680
We can use it to make some money

569
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
What do you think?

570
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Sir, you're thinking too much

571
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
You can't do this

572
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
If Eunuch Cao knows

573
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
he won't be able to explain

574
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Eunuch Cao won't investigate

575
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
Who hasn't done this kind of thing

576
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
of turning a blind eye to the situation?

577
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,680
It's different

578
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
Don't do it

579
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
I won't help you

580
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
You asked my father to help me

581
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,680
I've figured out a way for you

582
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
You're making it hard for me

583
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,680
I'll tell you

584
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
This is the situation in the Ministry of Works

585
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
I can only think of a way

586
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Don't be so ungrateful

587
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
You're being too serious

588
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
How about this?

589
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,680
I'll find another way by myself

590
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
I'll help you

591
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
What a thing!

592
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,680
Shi Xuan

593
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
Sir, you're here

594
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Look

595
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
The Ministry of Works

596
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
has changed a group of experienced workers

597
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
They even transferred the young ones

598
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
What's going on?

599
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
The Ministry of Works said

600
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
some places in the Palace were damaged

601
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
and they needed more people

602
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
These young workers were transferred to repair

603
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,680
They said they'd send us back after they were repaired

604
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
I'm Lu Ran

605
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
I'm a small official of the Commandant's Office

606
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
I'm a hard worker

607
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,680
I'm in charge of General Song's funeral

608
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Eunuch Cao asked me to ask you

609
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
There are some snacks in the box

610
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
Please enjoy them

611
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Thank you, Sir Lu

612
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
If you don't mind

613
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
why don't you take me in?

614
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
Please

615
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,680
This is the tomb of General Song

616
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
After he died

617
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
he was buried in such a small place

618
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
It's not small

619
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,680
Many people only buried a big piece of grass

620
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Sir Zang

621
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
We've just started carving

622
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
Sir Zang

623
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
We've just started carving

624
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:20,800
and we haven't even done the

625
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,680
This is a big project

626
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,680
You two are enough

627
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,680
Yes

628
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
I'm struggling too

629
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,680
But now the cold road is coming

630
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,680
I've sent people to keep an eye on His Majesty

631
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
So it's not easy for you to do this job

632
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Many officials who met with difficulties

633
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
thought they were being suppressed

634
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
They were so anxious that they wrote a memorial

635
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
and they were about to die in front of His Majesty

636
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Eunuch Cao means

637
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,680
if you're forced to do this

638
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,680
don't make a mistake in guessing

639
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Otherwise, you'll die in vain

640
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
But I'll say it again

641
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,680
There are always people who are willing to do this

642
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,680
If you really can't get through this

643
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,680
you can also focus on other things

644
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,680
I don't understand

645
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,680
Sir Lu

646
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,680
could you please give me more details?

647
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,680
I'll be straightforward

648
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Eunuch Cao sent me here today

649
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,680
He sent me here

650
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
because he was afraid you would misunderstand his good intentions

651
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Eunuch Cao is very loyal

652
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,680
He wants you to be responsible for General Fu's funeral

653
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,680
He thinks you're capable and stable

654
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,680
That's why he gave you a chance to show yourself in front of His Majesty

655
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,680
This is something that no one else can do

656
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
Thank you for your kindness, Eunuch Cao

657
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
I'm very grateful

658
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
You're having a family dinner the day after tomorrow

659
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
We'll invite some important officials to the party

660
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
If you're not busy

661
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
you can come and have fun

662
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,680
If you can please Eunuch Cao

663
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,680
you'll be able to do many things in the future

664
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
All right

665
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
I've done my job today

666
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I'm leaving

667
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Oh, right

668
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
I almost forgot

669
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
I have to give you a invitation

670
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,680
Otherwise, you won't be able to enter the door of Cao's mansion

671
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Please go over there

672
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
They're all actors

673
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,680
watching a camera

674
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,680
lt's better if he locks the door

675
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Please go over there

676
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
and play along with those thrive

677
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,160
Next time you don't do it, you will do it in the sangria

678
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,400
He harasses me first

679
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,040
and then sends people toened me

680
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,600
He wants me to rely on him for betraying RocardAUDIBLE

681
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,240
In the end

682
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,400
he is a ghost

683
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,680
So what about Lu Ran?

684
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,120
He should be Cao Jianxian's adopted son

685
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,280
It's hard to deal with the King of Yan

686
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,840
If the powder can't be delivered on time

687
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,080
Cao Jingxin will punish me for deceiving the emperor

688
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,000
I am afraid I will see the King of Yan

689
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,800
Xiaohai

690
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,560
Why don't you go to play with Eunuch Cao?

691
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
Ask for a favor

692
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,280
Master

693
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,400
You want me to stay with the guards?

694
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,280
Pingjing Duke still doesn't interfere with me

695
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,040
How to be a witness in the Youth Council

696
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,240
If I bribe Cao Jingxian

697
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,600
He can't have any relatives

698
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,400
I have told you

699
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,880
The court has its dangers

700
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,400
Although it's convenient to investigate

701
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,640
But it will face greater difficulties

702
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,280
You have learned so much

703
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,320
This is impossible

704
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,920
But my original intention

705
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,000
Never for being an official

706
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,720
I just want to revenge

707
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,840
Then I ask you

708
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,240
What is the most important thing to revenge?

709
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,960
Find the third enemy

710
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,640
wrong

711
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,520
You have to live

712
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,320
Live

713
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,440
You just took the position of Qin Tianjian

714
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,080
I have experienced so many things

715
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,440
And in the court

716
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,760
Face the Grand Preceptor of Ronglu and the Grand Preceptor of Zhangyin

717
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,120
Can't have any trouble

718
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,400
So good officers and bad officers

719
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,640
You have to be

720
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,480
Master

721
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,240
My enemy is these officials

722
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,240
The third person is probably also

723
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,040
I must revenge

724
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,720
But anyway

725
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,120
I can't be like them

726
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,720
Stupid

727
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,080
Be your good son

728
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,160
I'm a good man

729
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,280
Not all bad things

730
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,120
Let's get through Cao Jingxian first

731
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,800
Master, I have a way

732
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,160
What way

733
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,440
Master's way is

734
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,840
Tear it

735
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,600
Don't worry about it. Say it. What's the way

736
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,760
Master's way is

737
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,040
Think of another way

738
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
I'm sorry

739
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,640
I'm sorry

740
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,480
I'm sorry

741
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,240
I'm sorry

742
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,080
I'm sorry

743
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,080
I'm sorry

744
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm sorry

745
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm sorry

746
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm sorry

747
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm sorry

748
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm sorry

749
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm sorry

750
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm sorry

751
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm sorry

752
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm sorry

753
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm sorry

754
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm sorry

755
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
