26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Go.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Go.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Go.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The imperial examination of the Imperial College of the Left Lin Tai

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
of the Qingtian Sword

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
has been re-established in the Imperial College.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The efforts have been made.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The great contribution has been made.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I have the fortune of Ning Yu

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and the order of the eight-character Yin and Yang.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I am allowed to send the Empress Dowager's official fruit into the funeral.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will not leave the tomb again.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have reported to the late emperor,

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the Empress Dowager and the Imperial Court.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
My Lord,

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the funeral is so young.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How can we cremate the body?

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a great achievement to stay in the Qingtian Sword.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, my Lord.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
My Lord, think twice.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
My Lord, you shouldn't be cremated.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is also the meaning of the upper head.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I am also very sad.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now the sun and moon are overcast.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The nine rivers and waters are in a earthquake.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's all because the heaven and earth are not peaceful.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Have you ever counted the Qingtian Sword?

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
For the sake of the peace of the four seas and the peace of the eight directions,

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the dirty sea is the most suitable candidate.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is the honor that others want.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But you can't get it.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
My Lord.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
My Lord.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I will do it.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I am willing to cremate for the Empress Dowager.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Good.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Congratulations, Zang Hai.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is the honor of Mo Da.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My Lord.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Master Zang.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Master Zang.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why do you want to cremate for us?

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why did you agree so?

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes, my Lord.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If one person has too much seat,

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
he will become the target of the other person's illness.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He will be scared.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Luo Yi.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He deliberately arranged for you to build the underground palace.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But it seems that you have guessed it long ago.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not difficult to guess the mind of the people outside.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I just didn't expect that.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you all willing to cremate?

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I will think about it.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If we don't want to,

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
they will ask again and again.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Until you give in.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's good.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We still can't escape the freedom of being broken.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The court's atmosphere has reached such a point.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He used the emperor of the country.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Although he had already ordered the cremation,

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
he couldn't help it.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Later, someone took the initiative to do so.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Who dares to say no to the center of the burden?

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Who dares to say no?

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's just that he was forced to change it to his own wish.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's even more obvious here in Chu Huanming.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He can be a monster and a talent.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Talent?

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The court spent a lot of money.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
For the sake of these cremated people,

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we are all about to die.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why don't we use our lives to exchange for some money

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to let our families and children survive?

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Although we will be trampled by Chu Huanming,

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
in the end, we won't have much left.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But this money is a life-saving money

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
for our families.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But Zang Hai,

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
you are so young and promising.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why are you willing to die?

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Just like everyone else,

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
we are all bitter people.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The land of Yang Jian is similar.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It should only be drifted away and then be destroyed.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Come on.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's drink.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's drink to our heart's content.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Tomorrow, let's go in a rush.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Drink!

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Drink!

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Drink!

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Come on!

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Drink!

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Come on!

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Drink!

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Drink!

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Drink!

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Come on.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Empress Dowager, you are here.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Didn't His Majesty come?

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
According to the official,

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
His Majesty was too hurt during his command

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and injured his body.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So he was in the palace

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to pray for the Empress Dowager.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But he came.

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You were an official.

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you know these people?

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Over there,

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the head of the civil official

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
is the head of the imperial court.

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The head of the military official is Minister Li.

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The head of the university of the Central Hall is Shi Yiping.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The official is very cautious.

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He is considered the head of the imperial court.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Next to him is the head of the Ministry of Revenue.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The head of the university of the Imperial College is Zhao Bingwen.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He is the head of the cabinet.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The official is Gu Aoqing.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The head of the military official is the Marquis of Pingjing, Zhuang Ruyin.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The General of the State of Zheng

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and the Grand Preceptor of the State of Ronglu

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The head of the Ministry of Works, Zhuang Zhifu, is his son.

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Chu Huai Ming is their dog.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Bow.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Send the Empress Dowager to the funeral.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Your Highness.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Appoint the imperial bodyguards.

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Human Art Division.

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Saint Luoyuan School.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The last step.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Eyes on the tea bird.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
mapping the conversation

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
D stronger than gold

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,480
Go

168
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,680
Your Matchmaking

169
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,600
Come

170
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,380
Find any weapons

171
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,860
Any weapons

172
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,920
The Crown Prince

173
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,520
gave music to his throw

174
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,580
My ball

175
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,940
Have a look

176
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,020
At the last step

177
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,260
Ahh

178
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,180
The emperor's residence is not in the purple dust

179
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,780
The emperor's family is on a holiday

180
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,460
They also want to live in the purple dust

181
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,660
with the heart of the Northern Beggar

182
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,460
It's not just the state of Guang

183
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,780
Even the body of the Empress Dowager

184
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,660
is buried in this way

185
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,460
Do you think we can live in the purple dust

186
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,940
after we die?

187
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,460
Let's go

188
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
Go

189
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,060
Guys, I'm here to see you off

190
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
Come with me

191
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
Go

192
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,860
This is the plum wine and medicine I prepared for you

193
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,660
You should know that it's poisoned

194
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,860
It won't hurt after you take it

195
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,860
You will die peacefully in three days

196
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,660
It's a matter of life and death

197
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,260
Why are there so many tongues?

198
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,060
Have a good time in these three days

199
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,860
and go on your way safely

200
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,860
This is the wine from the city of Jian

201
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,860
I heard that it costs 300 yuan per tael

202
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,860
Open it

203
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,860
It's a different kind of wine

204
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,860
It smells so good

205
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,860
I'm so tired

206
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
I'm so tired

207
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,860
Young Master, here is your food

208
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,860
It's really tasty

209
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,860
Have more food and more acting

210
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
Come to my home to watch the drama

211
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,860
and have more food

212
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,860
This is my serious life

213
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,860
I'm in the middle of the night

214
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,860
Kneel

215
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Bow

216
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
Bow

217
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,860
The mechanism has been activated

218
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Soon we will see the surprise we prepared for him

219
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,860
I really want to see what Zang Hai will look like

220
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Do you know what this is?

221
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,860
Have you eaten deer meat?

222
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
I have beaten it before

223
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,860
But I was finally taken away by the poison in the box

224
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Actually I haven't eaten it

225
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,860
It's not a way to live

226
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,860
An old friend of mine once told me

227
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,860
that one day he would end the system of burying alive

228
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
But he didn't do it

229
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
I didn't do it either

230
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,860
Maybe one day the future generations will do it

231
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,860
If the future generations do everything for us

232
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,860
the future generations will only live a day better than the previous one

233
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,860
How can we have the face to stand in the way of heaven and earth?

234
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,860
Bow again

235
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
Come on

236
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Are you thirsty?

237
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,860
Or I can taste it for you

238
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,860
It's okay. We will die sooner or later

239
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Why not be a ghost?

240
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,860
Come on. We can't go out anyway

241
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,860
I'll drink first

242
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
Don't drink

243
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,860
I'm thirsty. I can't go out

244
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
Why?

245
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,860
Do you want to go out?

246
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,860
Stop thinking and stop persuading

247
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,860
Let's die in the most holy way

248
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
I have a way to get out

249
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,860
Get out?

250
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,860
Bow three times

251
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,860
Do you have any idea?

252
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,860
Do you secretly dig the escape route?

253
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
No

254
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,860
Digging the escape route in the imperial mausoleum is a crime of the Zhu Jiu tribe

255
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
No

256
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Get out from the gate

257
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,860
Get out of the gate of the inner temple

258
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,860
You want to take us out in a glorious way?

259
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,860
Bow four times

260
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
Bow three times

261
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Bow

262
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,860
Before the Dragon-slaying Ceremony is over

263
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,860
all the officials are here

264
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,860
They will see us when we go out

265
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,860
Yes

266
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,860
They will see us

267
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
We have to walk out in the dark

268
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,860
How is that possible?

269
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,860
We will be blocked when we go out in front of so many people

270
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
Yes

271
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
We will be implicated

272
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,860
If we don't fight, someone will be buried in the fire

273
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,860
The next one may even be your family

274
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,860
We are your family

275
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,860
What is the evidence?

276
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Just us?

277
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Yes

278
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
What can you do?

279
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,860
As long as we can walk to the gate of the imperial palace before the Dragon-slaying Ceremony is over

280
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,860
I am sure that you will be buried this time

281
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
They will let us out

282
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,860
Are you sure?

283
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,860
I believe you

284
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Tell me, what should we do?

285
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,860
Bow

286
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Before the Dragon-slaying Ceremony is over

287
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
The gate is not broken

288
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,860
It can be opened

289
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
The mechanism is outside

290
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,860
The mechanism is outside

291
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,860
But there must be a hidden line connecting the gate

292
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,860
We just need to find that hidden line

293
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,860
and we can manipulate the mechanism outside

294
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
I know

295
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,860
The hidden line connecting the gate is on the top

296
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,860
The gate is open

297
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,860
The gate is open

298
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,860
It's this brick

299
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,860
Brother, hee است

300
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Lift the stones

301
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
Okay

302
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,860
This is the brick.

303
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,060
Brothers, help me.

304
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
Okay.

305
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,860
Bring the stones up here.

306
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
Okay.

307
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
Put them down.

308
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,860
Zhu Huining.

309
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,860
I thought I could survive for three days

310
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,860
after the stone fell.

311
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,860
Now I still have the desire to live.

312
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,860
If I lose the desire after three days,

313
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,860
I will die.

314
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,860
But once the mechanism is activated,

315
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,860
I will be killed

316
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,860
and suffer the most.

317
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,860
So they set up the mechanism here

318
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,860
because we are here to die.

319
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,860
Are we all willing to die?

320
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,860
Why are you still doing this to us?

321
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,860
We have to pull the rope.

322
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
Open the door and get out.

323
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
Be careful.

324
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860
I'm going up.

325
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
Come and help me.

326
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,860
Go.

327
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,860
Be careful.

328
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
Go.

329
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Go.

330
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
Raise your shields.

331
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
What should we do?

332
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Only we can survive.

333
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
We can't even fight.

334
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Don't give up.

335
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,860
One more time.

336
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Get up on my shoulder.

337
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
Come on.

338
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Go.

339
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,860
Don't follow me.

340
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Hangzhou.

341
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,860
We are going to succeed.

342
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Come on.

343
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,860
Come on.

344
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
Open the door.

345
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
Raise your shields.

346
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Go.

347
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
Get up.

348
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,860
The door is open.

349
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Go home.

350
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Get up.

351
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Get up.

352
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
Get up.

353
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Go.

354
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Go.

355
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
Get up.

356
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
Get up.

357
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Get up.

358
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Go home.

359
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
Go.

360
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Wake up.

361
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Go home.

362
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Go.

363
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,860
Go.

364
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
Go.

365
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
Da Hai.

366
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Come here.

367
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,860
Why is Duanmu Shi not coming?

368
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,860
I can handle it.

369
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
You go first.

370
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
You go first.

371
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,860
It's too late.

372
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
Hurry.

373
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
Master.

374
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
What's going on?

375
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
I don't know.

376
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
Go and have a look.

377
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
Yes.

378
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
Go.

379
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,860
Why can't you see it?

380
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
I can handle it.

381
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,860
Come out.

382
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,860
You.

383
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
You.

384
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860

Did you get it?

468
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,960
You got beat up by a ghost?

469
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,580
Do you know the monster?

470
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,960
Yes

471
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,460

00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,860
I don't know it.

483
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,460
I don't know it.

484
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,220
You Chin up the ghost like this

485
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,900
You sure you want to do this?

486
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,620
You sure you want to do this?

487
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,460
You sure you want to do this?

488
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,500
Yes

489
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,500
How's it?

490
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,080
Yes

491
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,060
How's it?

492
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,820
How's it?

493
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,840
Some corpses are dancing outside.

494
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,620
The mission is Morrison.

495
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,880
이제 futur.

496
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,980
모자라!

497
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,140
Save them both!

498
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:54,060
There is a large amount of danger ahead modestly

499
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,660
A large amount of danger ahead modestly

500
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,300
Things seem to go fast

501
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,140
Unh flirt with Heaven's King

502
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,700
The moon nectar of repentance

503
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,340
was brought from the sky

504
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,340
Once indeed Xavian

505
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,180
chastised him

506
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,100
Lord

507
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,660
What a shame

508
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,660
Why did you come out?

509
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
If the Dragon-slaying Stone can't be dropped

510
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,540
what did you do?

511
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,180
I didn't do anything

512
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,620
but I shouldn't have died

513
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,580
As long as I come out

514
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,740
it will be dropped

515
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,940
Go

516
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
My Lord

517
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,460
it's all my fault

518
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,060
He moved the coffin of Imperial Concubine Li

519
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,780
Now the Dragon-slaying Stone can't be dropped

520
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,780
it's because of the former emperor's anger

521
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,940
And it's been calculated

522
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,460
there must be a person of the Eight-character Faction

523
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,260
to bury the body to calm down the storm

524
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,780
Now the body is buried

525
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,500
he doesn't want to bury it

526
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,940
but he comes out in a hurry

527
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,540
It's really...

528
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,980
It's really a bad omen

529
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,820
I dare to guess

530
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,100
the body is dead

531
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,740
the Dragon-slaying Stone must be dropped

532
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,180
Dr. Zuo of Qingtian Sword

533
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,980
I saw your loyalty and filial piety

534
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,420
I allowed you to send the empress dowager to the coffin

535
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,020
Why did you break your promise today?

536
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,420
The recent events in the imperial mausoleum

537
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,820
all started because of you

538
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,180
You should go back now

539
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,300
If you act alone

540
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,020
you will suffer the pain of being stabbed

541
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,140
Open it

542
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,420
What are you laughing at?

543
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:50,180
Lord

544
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,060
I laughter at the people of the court

545
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,340
being cheated by st industry

546
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,300
They Yayong kingdom's good fortune

547
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,260
D Lift the burden upon Dr. Zuo

548
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,700
If I can put aside my showcase

549
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
But I feel sorry for you

550
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,220
I want to cry for hundreds of masters

551
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,580
and for the Minister of Works

552
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,020
Why do you want to cry for me?

553
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,820
If I die

554
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,140
the Dragon-shrouding Stone won't fall

555
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,940
What should I do?

556
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,580
If you die, the Dragon-shrouding Stone won't fall

557
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,580
We will have workers to repair it

558
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,380
How long will it take to repair it?

559
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Three days, three months or a year

560
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,700
We will let the late emperor and the Empress Dowager

561
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
to die in the wilderness

562
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
The national mourning is the etiquette of a country

563
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
etiquette is the foundation of a country

564
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,700
and the law is the flag of a country

565
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Such a big disrespect

566
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
I am not content with my death

567
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,700
but I have implicated all the masters

568
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Master, Master

569
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,700
It's almost time

570
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
If we have more than forty-three classes

571
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
it will be too late

572
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
I ask you

573
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
If you come out

574
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,700
the Dragon-shrouding Stone won't fall

575
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
It won't fall?

576
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,700
If it doesn't fall

577
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
I am just a guest

578
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,700
But what you want

579
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
is the Dragon-shrouding Stone

580
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,700
to fall down?

581
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,700
Let him out

582
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Lord Chu once told me

583
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
to comfort the late emperor

584
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,700
I need a person who is compatible with the late emperor

585
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
to stay in the wilderness forever

586
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
It's not true

587
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,700
But this person is not me

588
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
Who is he?

589
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,700
Yang Zhen

590
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
You are talking nonsense

591
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,700
Before this, Lord Yang was 36 years old

592
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
According to Lord Yang's reputation

593
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,700
he rejected his eight-word

594
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Lord Yang is like a smoke

595
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
He is the one

596
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,700
who is so lucky

597
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
If we use his life

598
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
to drive the wind and water

599
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,700
the Dragon-shrouding Stone will fall

600
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,700
You

601
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,700
At the birthday banquet

602
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Lord Chu was there

603
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,700
If you don't believe

604
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
you can ask Lord Chu

605
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
Chu Huai Ming

606
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
Is he telling the truth?

607
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,700
Yes

608
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,700
No

609
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
No

610
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Yes or no?

611
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,700
Yes

612
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
But

613
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,700
My lords

614
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,700
Lord, it's almost past the time

615
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
Lord

616
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,700
Don't miss

617
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,700
the funeral

618
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
Lord

619
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,700
It's past the time

620
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
I just died

621
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
I don't have enough time

622
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,700
But if you are implicated

623
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
I will die

624
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Please decide

625
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
You

626
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
Go in

627
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,700
Please don't

628
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
He is trying to escape from the trap

629
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,700
You can't believe him

630
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,700
Don't you see?

631
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
He has died

632
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
My lord

633
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
He is trying to drag me

634
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
to the end

635
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,700
Don't worry

636
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,700
You go in

637
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,700
As soon as the Dragon-shrouding Stone moves

638
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,700
I will kill Zang Hai

639
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,700
and save you

640
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
If you don't go in

641
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
you won't believe me

642
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,700
My lord

643
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,700
My lord

644
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,700
My lord

645
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
My lord

646
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
My lord

647
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,700
Don't fall

648
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
Don't fall

649
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,700
Don't fall

650
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,700
Where is he?

651
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
Where is he?

652
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,700
My lord

653
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,700
He is trying to drag me

654
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Drag me

655
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,700
It's moving

656
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,700
How could it be?

657
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
No

658
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
The Dragon-shrouding Stone has fallen

659
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
It's really falling

660
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
It's really falling

661
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
It's really falling

662
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,700
My lord

663
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
My lord

664
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,700
Zang Hai

665
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Go away

666
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
I don't want to go

667
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,700
Let me out

668
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
Let me out

669
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
My lord

670
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,700
My lord

671
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
You'd better get me out

672
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,700
I'm loyal to you

673
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,700
My lord

674
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,700
You can't see

675
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,700
Zang Hai

676
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,700
and kill me

677
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,700
My lord

678
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,700
My lord

679
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Zhuang Ruyi

680
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
You

681
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
for Zang Hai

682
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,700
have put us

683
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700
into this situation

684
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,700
I've calculated

685
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
how many people

686
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
and how many Zang Tze

687
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,700
Zang Hai

688
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,700
can help you

689
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,700
Do you remember

690
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,700
the nine years of my life

691
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,700
If it wasn't for me

692
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
how could I have done

693
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,700
such a clean job

694
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,700
I'm going to tell everyone

695
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,700
You

696
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,700
You're going to get out

697
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,700
My lord

698
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,700
The wind blows in my eyes

699
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,700
The palm of my hand

700
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,700
is holding the hope of danger

701
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,700
The green grass is in full bloom

702
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,700
The sound of tears

703
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,700
is like the sound of the flute

704
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:21,700
I can't bear to look at it

705
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,700
I can't bear to look at it

706
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,700
The shadow is my life

707
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:40,700
The eyes are my sword

708
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,700
The light is always on

709
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:50,700
The hidden is never dark

710
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,700
Only because

711
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,700
my heart is burning

712
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,700
The clouds are me

713
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,700
The clouds are me

714
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,700
The will to fall

715
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,700
I will always be

716
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,700
remembered

717
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,700
The sound of the sand is me

718
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,700
The rain is me

719
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,700
The birds are like the sun

720
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,700
I sing with the military

721
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,700
The dream is me

722
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,700
The autumn is me

723
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,700
The world is me

724
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,700
The world is me

725
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,700
You are me too

726
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,700
You are me too
