1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I met an old friend.

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I know that he will come back this time

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to kill Die Ti and avenge his family.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I want him to leave the capital

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and never come back.

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Mother,

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I didn't do anything wrong, right?

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Zhidong, look.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This flower is rare.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
After it's grown,

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it can be used as medicine.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's very rare.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
After it's grown, it can be used as medicine.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The flower and the seed are poisonous.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Who is it?

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Second Young Master,

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
why are you still here?

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I haven't finished my work yet.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't leave.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll report you?

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm afraid.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I came here today to kill you.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I changed my mind now.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Listen,

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
don't think that you'll allow me to kill my father

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
if you help me.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Give up.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What are you doing?

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Second Young Master, look.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is this the only flower on the grave?

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's so strange about flowers on the grave?

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Have you seen this flower

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
anywhere else in the forest?

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's called Poisonous Lime.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The whole plant is poisonous.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why is this kind of poisonous plant

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
only growing on your mother's grave

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and still so alive?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Maybe it's a seed

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
that came from somewhere else.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Poisonous Lime

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
is a poisonous plant that's unique to South Zhao State.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It can't come to the capital.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What do you mean?

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Either someone

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
planted it on your mother's grave,

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
or it's the body in the grave

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that has the seeds of Poisonous Lime.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But you should know

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
that the former is almost impossible.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What are you trying to say?

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If I'm not wrong,

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
your mother was poisoned to death by it.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Impossible.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
My mother died of illness.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Before she died,

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was by her side all night.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No one could poison her.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Poisonous Lime is not as poisonous as Poisonous Lime.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But its flower poison can take one point every day.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's accumulated in the Six Residents of Wuzang.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
One day,

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
it will die.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What's going on?

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You just need to

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
ask the aunt of the Hall of Commandment

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to find out the truth.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You want me to dig my mother's grave?

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't you want to know the truth?

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Maybe the one who poisoned the Hall of Commandment

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
is the one you love most

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and least expect.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Zang Hai, you bastard.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What do you want to say?

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You want to say that my father killed my mother?

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's impossible.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's impossible.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You want to kill my father

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and dig my mother's grave?

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You lie to her.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You are crazy.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then I ask you.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Why are the graves of the ancestors

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
in the southeast of the forest?

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Your mother's grave is in the north.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why is it so shallow?

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why can't her memorial tablet

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
be put in the ancestral hall?

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Shut up.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The most important thing is

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
your mother died so long ago.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why didn't your father

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
worship her at all?

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why?

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You can ask others.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But you can't ask me

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
if you are as I said.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you don't believe that she has the poison,

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
do you have the courage to eat her?

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I won't believe

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
every word you say.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll give you one last chance.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Get out.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
When you worship the ancestors tomorrow,

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
open your eyes and look at it clearly.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
See if what I said is true.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You are right.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
When you see the dust,

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
say you want to smell it.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Take your time to breathe.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Shoot.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm right.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Good. Xing.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Come on. Drink some water.

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You are right.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm right.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm right.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm right.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm right.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm right.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm right.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Fine.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Mom.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now you said

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
you'll have a Bring-Need Noodles with me

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
only by eating.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Will you three only stop by

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
to get trained well?

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This laund.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Is what I call disposition at the age of beginning.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The next general

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
in the duke's family

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
is her.

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,720
How can he bear such a heavy burden?

135
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
You should teach him yourself.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,120
Alright, let's continue.

137
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,800
Don't be afraid.

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
Lord, Madam,

139
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,720
the carriage is ready.

140
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,200
The paddlers arrived early

141
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,720
and prepared the offerings.

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Do you bring the hunting items?

143
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Yes. Don't worry, Madam.

144
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,000
Father, it's too early today.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,800
I didn't see Lord Zang.

146
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,880
He's not going?

147
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,360
He's not feeling well.

148
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,760
Zui has already taken a leave.

149
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's go.

150
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,600
Anything else?

151
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,520
I...

152
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,480
Zhixing.

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Don't waste the time of the ritual.

154
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
I'll tell father on the way.

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Zhixing.

156
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,440
I have something to talk to father on the way.

157
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,000
You can talk to him when you arrive.

158
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
This way.

159
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,840
Sweet karmic,

160
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,520
lay in love with someone forever.

161
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,400
For good fortune we'll create,

162
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,520
dishonest and free.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

164
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,060
to the land!

165
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,860
Don't let us lose.

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,280
The ancestors,

167
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,600
unfilial descendants,

168
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,640
Zhuang Lu Yin,

169
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,720
came to pay respect to you.

170
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,280
The family of the Marquis is well.

171
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,840
Please take care of yourself.

172
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,200
I hope the ancestors and the spirits

173
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,440
can bless you.

174
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,760
Bow.

175
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,080
Bow.

176
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,320
Bow again.

177
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,400
Bow.

178
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,280
Bow three times.

179
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,320
Bow.

180
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,200
Best ratted.

181
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,600
My late father

182
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,160
bird is here.

183
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,560
kindergarten傳32

184
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,720
grammar

185
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,980
Marquis, portlige

186
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,600
After it has been left outside for so long

187
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Nr continue to terrorize the Italians

188
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,500
We will be most mournful

189
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,020
Withz is poor

190
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,040
Should keep calm

191
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,540
Letzi

192
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,900

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,160
If we still have to leave

194
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,480
I will forget about it

195
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Madam, is there anything wrong with the flowers?

196
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,360
Why are you asking so many questions?

197
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,240
Throw them away.

198
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,600
Yes.

199
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,360
Father.

200
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,280
What is it now?

201
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,880
You haven't visited Mother for a long time.

202
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,000
Since she passed away, you haven't visited her.

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,680
I'm going hunting for hunting later.

204
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
Don't you not like hunting?

205
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,280
Go by yourself.

206
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,560
Go.

207
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,680
Master, did you see it?

208
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,960
I must hunt her today.

209
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,960
You two, go and have a look.

210
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,080
Father.

211
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Good swordplay.

212
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,840
Why are you here?

213
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't you like riding horses?

214
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
When I was young, Father taught me to ride a horse.

215
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,240
I still have some problems.

216
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,840
You're always enjoying yourself, but you don't practice.

217
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,040
Since you're here, follow me.

218
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,440
Father.

219
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,840
My son saw a path just now.

220
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,640
He went that way.

221
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,240
I'll go and have a look.

222
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,840
Go.

223
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,240
Father.

224
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,840
What's wrong?

225
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,440
What are you doing?

226
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,040
Father has been unwilling to see Mother for many years.

227
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,440
I can only use this to lure Father here.

228
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,840
You really don't miss her at all?

229
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,440
You don't want to see her?

230
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,440
You used to love her and care for her so much.

231
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,840
Why did Father change?

232
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,440
Why did everything change?

233
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,440
When I think of her,

234
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,240
I feel uncomfortable.

235
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,440
So I'd rather not think about her.

236
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,240
I won't see her.

237
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,440
Will Father still be sad for Mother?

238
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
Enough.

239
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,840
Let's go back.

240
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Father, wait!

241
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,440
The flowers on Mother's grave are pretty.

242
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Please take them back. They're in the vase.

243
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
If she misses you,

244
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,840
she might be able to see you through these flowers.

245
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,640
I know.

246
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,840
She must miss you a lot.

247
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,240
Soul-sharing is all about the endless talk.

248
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,440
We, the West Martial Arts, never believe in this.

249
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,640
No matter what, these are flowers from my mother's grave.

250
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,840
It's also a good thing that you brought them back to keep them.

251
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,640
A man should not be too careless.

252
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,840
I'm sorry for being so kind to you today.

253
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,640
I don't want to punish you either.

254
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,440
It's getting late. Let's go.

255
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,440
You put that man in the poison, right?

256
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,040
My guess is that it's Wu Ping.

257
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,040
He's the one who made you see him.

258
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,240
Mother didn't raise a child.

259
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,740
We would just take her in as a normal recuperation.

260
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,440
I haven't seen so many people to Carrot Hall.

261
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,340
Do you remember how you cried?

262
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,420
Judging by your tone, taste and feel,

263
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,060
this gives me a taste of a farm.

264
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,340
Fert versed in grass and tamar Hill.

265
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,820
It's hard to imagine

266
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,780
this would be a tomb of his alles.

267
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,620
I'm about to open the coffin.

268
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,020
If you can't bear the sight of it,

269
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,620
I'm not hungry

270
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
This is my mother

271
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:35,900
Come on

272
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,500
Three, two, one

273
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,820
Come on

274
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,560
Hurgh…

275
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:32,420
He has body

276
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,160
and congenital hemorrhage

277
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,360
Before his death,

278
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,060
what did he experience?

279
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,440
Disorder

280
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,400
Was he born with this men selection condition?

281
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,100
Maybe

282
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,320
it happened because he was on his deathbed

283
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,500
It's a too long process

284
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,420
That's right

285
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,500
They often say nonsense

286
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,660
They leave with grudges

287
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,740
That's right

288
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,720
That is the symptom of Shoot- contextival

289
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,460
People with Shoot- classic People with Shoot- playlist

290
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,820
will have a trait

291
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,600
that is spouses are smaller and complex

292
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,140
On top of that,

293
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,040
ガ probably makes noise before he died

294
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,800
Let alone doc internet

295
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,120
It is the most painful expression

296
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
I've been following my master since I was a child.

297
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I can't be wrong.

298
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I think

299
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
your mother died

300
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
and there are still seeds that haven't withered.

301
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,500
As time goes by, the seeds will lose their leaves

302
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
and enter the soil.

303
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
That's how they will sprout.

304
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
My mother was born as a man.

305
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
She suffered from stomach pain.

306
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
She was born as a man.

307
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
She suffered from stomach pain.

308
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Why?

309
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Why?

310
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Why?

311
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
This person

312
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
doesn't have to commit a crime

313
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
to cause the killing.

314
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
This poison doesn't kill people

315
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
in one go.

316
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
It needs to be taken for a long time

317
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
and it will only explode

318
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
when it's been accumulated to a certain extent.

319
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
That means

320
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
it's done by someone else.

321
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Outsiders can't do it

322
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
and it won't be discovered.

323
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
I asked you to check the records yesterday.

324
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
What did you see?

325
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:47,920
The

326
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
This should be a coincidence.

327
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
You don't need to worry too much.

328
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
If it's just a coincidence,

329
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
it's good.

330
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
I'm afraid someone did it on purpose.

331
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
What you said

332
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
was about the Second Young Master.

333
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Do you think

334
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
he really saw something?

335
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
I don't think so.

336
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
The Second Young Master

337
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
used to be a

338
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
coward.

339
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
He's been like this this year.

340
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Nothing strange.

341
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
With his personality,

342
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
he must have caused a lot of trouble.

343
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
How can he be as quiet as he is now?

344
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Besides,

345
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
what can he do if he knows?

346
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
He's not afraid of anything.

347
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
With his current

348
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
wretched appearance,

349
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
he can't make a big trouble.

350
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
It's better to use a good method

351
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
to raise him.

352
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
He's in charge of

353
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
the food and clothing in the mansion.

354
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,500
My mother

355
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
got sick

356
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
one year after she came back to the capital.

357
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Zeng Ziyuan

358
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
is a good man.

359
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
The letter is so good.

360
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Mother, what's wrong?

361
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
At first,

362
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
I invited many doctors

363
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
and treated the old man

364
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,500
who wasn't well.

365
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
But the disease got worse.

366
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
I was anxious.

367
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
I stopped playing.

368
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
I stayed with him every day.

369
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
I didn't go anywhere.

370
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
But he never got better.

371
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Then,

372
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
I went to see my father.

373
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
I went to see my father.

374
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
But he didn't want to see me.

375
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Mother.

376
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Mother.

377
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
I don't want you to die.

378
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
I don't want you to leave.

379
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Mother,

380
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,500
no matter where you are,

381
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,500
I will bless you.

382
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,500
You must listen to me.

383
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Why?

384
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Why didn't I come to see you?

385
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Did you abandon us?

386
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
No.

387
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
No.

388
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Xin'er,

389
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
no matter what,

390
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
he is the one

391
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
who loves you most in this world.

392
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
I don't want you to die.

393
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
You are like my father.

394
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500
You are a man who is loyal to the heaven and earth.

395
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
I only hope

396
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,500
you can live happily.

397
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
This is my only wish.

398
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
I hope

399
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,500
you can leave by yourself.

400
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
I can't be with you.

401
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Mother.

402
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Mother.

403
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Mother.

404
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,500
I don't want you to leave.

405
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
I beg you.

406
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
I beg you.

407
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Mother.

408
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,500
My father never came to see her.

409
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I don't understand

410
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
why my mother lost her favor.

411
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Why did my father

412
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
make us

413
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
so angry?

414
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
I saw the flowers

415
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
last night at your mother's grave.

416
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
I thought it wasn't that simple.

417
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I asked around

418
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
about you in the mansion.

419
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
The servants said the same thing.

420
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
They all said

421
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
your mother betrayed your father.

422
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Your mother used her body as a bait

423
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
to get close to a drug lord.

424
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
They were secretly in a relationship.

425
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Nonsense!

426
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
My mother loved my father.

427
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
She would never do such a thing.

428
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Do you want to know the truth?

429
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Jiang Xiang had a

430
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
blind maid.

431
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
Five years ago,

432
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
she was kicked out of the mansion

433
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
because of a crime.

434
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
I asked her to find her

435
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
and asked her the truth.

436
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Your mother and the drug lord

437
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
were the rumors

438
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
she spread

439
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
in the mansion.

440
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Stop it.

441
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I'll do it.

442
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
A woman's crime

443
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
is a crime without a word.

444
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
To destroy a woman

445
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
and her true identity

446
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
is the most effective way

447
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
in the past thousand of years.

448
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
If you still don't believe me,

449
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
I can give you this person.

450
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
You can ask him yourself.

451
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Does my father

452
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
know about this?

453
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
I've checked.

454
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
The lord has returned to the capital.

455
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
His majesty has taken his military power.

456
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
He wants to take the throne

457
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
and help Jiang Xiang's father

458
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
Minister of Rites, Jiang Jing.

459
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
In front of the whole world,

460
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
he chose Jiang Xiang.

461
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
I'm afraid he's been

462
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
cold-hearted to your mother

463
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
since that time.

464
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
My mother

465
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
was also

466
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
poisoning my mother.

467
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
As for whether the lord

468
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
was involved in the poisoning,

469
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
there's a way to find out.

470
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
It's up to you

471
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
to continue investigating

472
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
or to pretend

473
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
to be deaf and mute for the rest of your life.

474
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
My father saw her.

475
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
He knew her.

476
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
He knew everything.

477
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
He knew everything.

478
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
My mother

479
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
was killed by her

480
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
and Jiang Xiang's conspiracy.

481
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
I think my son

482
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
doesn't need her

483
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
anymore.

484
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
What you said is wrong.

485
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
The lord's favor

486
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
is not always the same.

487
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
He used to favor you.

488
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
He used to be a good man.

489
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
He used to be a good man.

490
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
He used to favor you

491
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
because he loved your mother

492
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
and thought you

493
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
could inherit her

494
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
from him.

495
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
He now admires the lord

496
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
because Jiang Xiang's family

497
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
is loyal to him.

498
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
And you were raised by Jiang Xiang

499
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
as a useless man.

500
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
He likes

501
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
people who are useful to him.

502
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
It's not hard

503
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
to get such a love.

504
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
As long as you trust me,

505
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
and do as I say,

506
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I will let you

507
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
get what you want.

508
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
I just want to avenge my mother.

509
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
It's not hard to get Jiang Xiang.

510
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
What she wants

511
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
is to make Zhuang's Mansion

512
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
the next owner of the mansion.

513
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Once Zhuang's Mansion loses its favor,

514
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Jiang Xiang will lose his support.

515
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
The best revenge

516
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
for a person

517
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
is to destroy his greatest hope.

518
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Now you

519
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
are not as good as him.

520
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
But this is your advantage.

521
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Jiang Xiang is not worth it.

522
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
But now my father

523
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
has become my enemy.

524
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Sang Hai, my father

525
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
is your enemy.

526
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
You want to kill him to avenge your family.

527
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
But why do you help me?

528
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
I need to

529
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
find out something from Pingjing Duke.

530
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
This is very important to me.

531
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
But you can't ask.

532
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
Someone needs to help you

533
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
to find out.

534
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Yes. My family's murder case

535
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
was killed by your father

536
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
and two other people.

537
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
One is the eunuch, Cao Jingxian.

538
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
And the other person

539
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I still don't have any clues.

540
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
I need to find this person.

541
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Before this,

542
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
I won't alert the police.

543
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
You want me to find out

544
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
this person's identity from my father.

545
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
This is your condition.

546
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Yes.

547
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
What will you do

548
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
after you find out?

549
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
I will ask.

550
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
I asked too much.

551
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
You came to Hong's Mansion

552
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
to avenge your family.

553
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
I must avenge my family.

554
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
If you don't want to do it,

555
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
you can tell the lord

556
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
my real identity.

557
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
He killed my mother.

558
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
I can't forgive him.

559
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
But he is my father.

560
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I have the enemy

561
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
who killed my family.

562
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
But I can't kill him.

563
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
I have to be close to him.

564
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
You know who your enemy is.

565
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
But you still want to be happy.

566
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
You are so quiet and love him.

567
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
For you,

568
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
I can do anything.

569
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
It's the common thing.

570
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
It's the most

571
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
inconvenient thing in the past.

572
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
I can help you find out the truth.

573
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
But I don't know

574
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
if I can help you avenge your family.

575
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
If I regret it,

576
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
don't blame me.

577
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
You helped me to find the enemy

578
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
and hide your identity.

579
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
I am so grateful.

580
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
I can't force you to do it.

581
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
If you do it,

582
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
I will be happy.

583
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
I just want to ask you to help me.

584
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Please avenge me.

585
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
From now on,

586
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
I will do everything you say.

587
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
We are one.

588
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
We are one.

589
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
In a year,

590
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
I will make him the most trusted son of Pingjing duke.

591
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
After he finds out

592
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
who is the third one,

593
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
I will take revenge.

594
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
As you wish.

595
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
What if he can't

596
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
say anything in the end?

597
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Can you wait?

598
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
You remind me.

599
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I have been a father for ten years.

600
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
I don't want to be defeated.

601
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
From now on,

602
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
I will be more careful.

603
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Xia Hai.

604
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Let me tell you about Cao Jingxian.

605
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
He and Pingjing duke

606
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
are on official business.

607
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
But Zhuang Zhifu is a man of great merit.

608
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
He often builds the royal garden.

609
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
He can't avoid the private sword.

610
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
I guess

611
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
the money he is greedy for

612
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
is all in his pocket.

613
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
It's a good idea.

614
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Besides, his guards are tight.

615
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
He goes to the palace.

616
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
He usually stays in the capital.

617
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
It's hard to get close to him.

618
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
It's like climbing the sky.

619
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
But

620
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
after two months,

621
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
there is a chance.

622
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
You mean

623
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
the court's competition

624
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
is also forcing men to break through.

625
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
It's also

626
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
the favorite of the princes.

627
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Every year,

628
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
the chief eunuch of the imperial sword

629
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
will come to the emperor for the award.

630
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
Then,

631
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
we will see Cao Jingxian.

632
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
It's the right time.

633
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Your Wu Di Quan

634
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
is so handsome.

635
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
He is so handsome.

636
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
You are his apprentice.

637
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
You are his master.

638
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
You are here to enjoy the good fortune.

639
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
You are here to enjoy the good fortune.

640
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Why are you here?

641
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
I told you

642
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
you should call me Zeng Hai from now on.

643
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Isn't this

644
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
the last time

645
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
I see you?

646
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
You are the second son of Zhuang.

647
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
You know me?

648
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Sir,

649
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
why did you ask me to come out of the mansion

650
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
and bring me here?

651
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
I want you to learn martial arts here.

652
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Since you want to

653
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
win the favor of Pingjing duke,

654
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
you can't go that way.

655
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
You have to go to the west.

656
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Your father will think

657
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
you have inherited his martial arts

658
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
and become a general.

659
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Zeng Hai,

660
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
are you going to learn my materials?

661
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
Yes.

662
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Are you crazy?

663
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
He is the son of Pingjing duke.

664
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
You brought him here.

665
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
Aren't you afraid that you will expose yourself?

666
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
He knows my identity.

667
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
He knows your identity.

668
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Then why do you keep him alive?

669
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Don't worry.

670
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
He has made a plan with me.

671
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
He will practice martial arts here

672
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
these days.

673
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
I will teach him a good lesson.

674
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Tu'er,

675
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
he is better than you.

676
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
He is a good person.

677
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Shut up.

678
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
He is so kind

679
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
and hardworking.

680
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Can he wake up?

681
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
It depends on your ability.

682
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
I will entrust him to you two.

683
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
In two months,

684
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
he needs to practice a magic potion.

685
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Sir,

686
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
can we change a place?

687
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I am so tired.

688
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
I don't have a good table.

689
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Besides, where can I rest?

690
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
So...

691
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
I won't say it.

692
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Sir,

693
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
let's stop here.

694
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
From now on,

695
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
you should follow these two masters to practice martial arts.

696
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Don't forget

697
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
what you promised me.

698
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
You should listen to me.

699
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
This is the first step

700
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
to the success of the martial arts.

701
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
I can't be idle.

702
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,500
I need to make a big deal for you in the capital.

703
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Lower your body.

704
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
You can't squat down.

705
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Look at me.

706
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
You should do like this.

707
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
I see.

708
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Give me a bite.

709
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Don't be lazy.

710
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,500
I am thirsty and hungry.

711
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Give me a piece.

712
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Don't be shy.

713
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Squat down.

714
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Sir,

715
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I only hope to see your dignity.

716
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
I am relieved

717
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
when I see you are fine.

718
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
You want to see me?

719
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
What do you want to see me?

720
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
I am a man of the world.

721
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
I am the star of the sky.

722
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
I can make a deal.

723
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
You are the son of the heaven.

724
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
You are the star of the sky.

725
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
You will be happy.

726
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
I...

727
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
If you have nothing to do,

728
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
please go back.

729
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
I am insulted.

730
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
Please help me.

731
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Sir,

732
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
you are the son of the heaven.

733
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
You are the best.

734
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Who dares to insult you?

735
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
I am ashamed.

736
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
I am a guest of the Zanghai family.

737
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
He is a sinister man.

738
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
He is the first one.

739
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
I offended him.

740
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
I am afraid he will do something to me.

741
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Please help me.

742
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
I will do it.

743
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
You have the support of the lord.

744
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Why do you ask the provincial committee?

745
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Sir,

746
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
I am not a man of the world.

747
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
I only do things for the court

748
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
and the emperor.

749
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
If you need me,

750
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
I will do everything

751
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
to help you.

752
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
I see.

753
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
Please go back.

754
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,500
The mountain is full of clouds.

755
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
I can't get in.

756
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Yes.

757
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
The mountain is full of clouds.

758
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
The mountain is full of clouds.

759
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
The mountain is full of clouds.

760
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
The mountain is full of clouds.

761
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
The mountain is full of clouds.

762
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
The mountain is full of clouds.
