5
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,300
May I see your face in the examination.?

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,820
I guess you prepared it well today.

7
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,320
Sir.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I gave him the choice.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He chose it himself.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What you said is true.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I didn't understand.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Can I give him a physical face?

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't worry.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I will keep him a full body.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will keep him a full body.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you want to see him again?

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's a fact.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I have nothing to say to him.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm afraid he doesn't want to see me again.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sir.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want to cook for Xiao Hai.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want him to be full and then be killed.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You should do that.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I forgot.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm here.

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What else do you want to say?

30
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Wake up.

31
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sir.

32
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is called a stick.

33
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a dirty tissue that is soaked in water.

34
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It can be used to cover your face.

35
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This way, you can keep your hands firm.

36
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is what you need to do.

37
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You need to do it without any doubt.

38
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sir.

40
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If there is another one,

41
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
he won't wake up.

42
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have two more.

43
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

44
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sir.

45
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sir.

46
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sir.

47
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Sir.

48
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sure he's dead.

49
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Sir.

50
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Prince Yong Rong called a royal family to his house.

51
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They only want to see you.

52
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They are all gone.

53
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Sir.

54
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Gao Ming.

55
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Sir.

56
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Gao Ming.

57
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Please take care of him.

58
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Thank you.

59
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you.

60
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Thank you.

61
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you.

62
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you.

63
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Sir, I'm sorry.

64
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yu Nong.

65
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Who are you?

66
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I am...

67
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yu Nong, come here.

68
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Mother.

69
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Mother is in a mess.

70
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
She can't find you.

71
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She's crying again.

72
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I did this for you.

73
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You need to take it.

74
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Mother.

75
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Mother.

76
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Mother.

77
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Zh... Zhino?

78
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Brother.

79
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You are Zhino?

80
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You are really Zhino?

81
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Good boy.

82
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't cry.

83
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But...

84
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why are you here?

85
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You...

86
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You...

87
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Why are you here?

88
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Mother.

89
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I miss you so much.

90
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Brother.

91
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You are so tall.

92
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I can't recognize you.

93
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Are you really Zhino?

94
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I thought you couldn't find the way home.

95
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I...

96
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No.

97
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You shouldn't be here.

98
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Who asked you to come back?

99
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Go.

100
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't come back.

101
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Mother, I'm not going.

102
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm not going anywhere.

103
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Mother.

104
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Brother, go.

105
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Brother.

106
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Zhino.

107
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Go.

108
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Go.

109
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why do you all want to go with me?

110
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't want to go back.

111
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't want to go back.

112
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't want to go back.

113
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't want to go back.

114
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Zhino.

115
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Zhino.

116
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Father.

117
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't go ahead.

118
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You are not here.

119
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm not here.

120
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm not here.

121
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Father.

122
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm going home.

123
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No matter how tired and how hard it is,

124
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
you have to continue to go.

125
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Your life has just begun.

126
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You came here.

127
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But not today.

128
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You are the good son of our Kui family.

129
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Your life and death are all because of the world.

130
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Father.

131
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Father.

132
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Father.

133
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Father.

134
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Deng Hai.

135
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Deng Hai.

136
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Deng Hai.

137
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Deng Hai.

138
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Doctor.

139
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I mean, can the air-conditioner come back?

140
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I only have to save him.

141
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Because he is a person.

142
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I will do my best.

143
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Now I will try to get him out of here.

144
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Of course.

145
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Deng Hai.

146
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Doctor Deng.

147
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Deng Hai.

148
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You are awake.

149
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Deng Hai.

150
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Deng Hai.

151
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Deng Hai.

152
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Deng Hai.

153
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Deng Hai.

154
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Deng Hai.

155
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Be careful.

156
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Be careful.

157
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,640
Zanghai,

158
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,880
thanks to Master Gao Ming,

159
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
I saved you.

160
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,920
Miss Xiang asked Miss Tong'er to come to me

161
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,200
to discuss your plan.

162
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,800
But, Mr. Zhao,

163
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,160
you are really cautious.

164
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,320
You must be careful

165
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,760
before you can change the plan.

166
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,120
Did you add anything

167
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,560
in the food?

168
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,640
People will be sick

169
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,480
if they eat it.

170
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,560
They will be ill.

171
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,360
I added honey.

172
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,960
So,

173
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,240
you can buy the whole house

174
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,840
in advance.

175
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,320
The pork liver is very thick.

176
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,440
It has oil,

177
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,400
water,

178
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,960
and sea power.

179
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,040
I know you are very careful.

180
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,320
I know

181
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,440
you will understand

182
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,560
the food you see.

183
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,760
If you are sober,

184
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
you won't stop

185
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,240
the fight

186
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,600
until the last moment.

187
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,760
That's all.

188
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,240
Thank you.

189
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,720
Thank you.

190
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,200
You have to thank someone else.

191
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I'm afraid there are fewer of them.

192
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Mr. Zhang.

193
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Mr. Shen.

194
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,320
The prince can't see you in person.

195
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,920
He has something to tell me to tell you.

196
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Qin Jiang.

197
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,680
Before the emperor's death,

198
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
he was calling out your name.

199
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,080
The emperor also said you were right.

200
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,560
What about the prince now?

201
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,200
Don't worry, Mr. Zhang.

202
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
The prince is the emperor's brother.

203
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Zhao Bingwen won't dare to act recklessly.

204
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,440
I can't keep it for long.

205
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,040
I have to go now.

206
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,040
Take care, Mr. Zhang.

207
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Take care.

208
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Sit.

209
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Zhang Hai.

210
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,600
What are you going to do next?

211
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm going to Dongxia.

212
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Dongxia?

213
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,240
Zhao Bingwen told me

214
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,440
he would take me to Dongxia.

215
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,080
I have to stop him

216
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,720
from making his army there.

217
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,440
I'll go with you.

218
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,880
I can't let him succeed.

219
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,680
And you've never been to Dongxia.

220
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm more familiar with it.

221
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,120
I've never been to Dongxia.

222
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,320
I'm not familiar with it.

223
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,640
I'm more familiar with it.

224
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,120
But now, except me and Xiao Hai,

225
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,880
others have come to Jin Aling.

226
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
It's hard to get out of this city.

227
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,040
The official, the envoy, and the phoenix, the phoenix and the phoenix are all here.

228
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,160
I'll find a way to meet you.

229
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Master.

230
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,240
We have to take An Tu with us.

231
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,680
We'll leave when we're ready.

232
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
Xiao Hai,

233
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,760
when we're out of the city,

234
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,120
I'll take you to a safe place.

235
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,520
You'll go to Dongxia's team

236
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,440
and leave for the big city.

237
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,760
When we're in Dongxia,

238
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,280
we'll rely on Miss Xiang.

239
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Master,

240
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,440
you're not with us.

241
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,280
I can't go.

242
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,960
I have to stay with Mr. Zhao

243
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,960
to watch over his movements.

244
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,400
Xiao Hai has been walking on the Ghost Museum.

245
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,160
I'm scared now.

246
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Master,

247
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,360
it turns out that the people who know the death

248
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,480
can dream of their own family.

249
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,560
They're still the same as I remember.

250
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,400
What did they say to you?

251
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,440
They said they missed me.

252
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,040
They told me to come back.

253
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Xiao Hai,

254
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,280
do you still remember the day you left the Star Tower?

255
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,040
The day Master left for another place.

256
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Actually,

257
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,280
I quarreled with your Master.

258
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,560
He always thought

259
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
that the cure shouldn't be a disaster.

260
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,520
To forget hatred

261
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,960
can start a new life.

262
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,480
But I thought

263
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,320
only after you've solved hatred,

264
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,800
can you really find your own future.

265
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Don't worry.

266
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
I'm no longer the same as you.

267
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,200
I'm giving you

268
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,280
the day you left.

269
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Remember,

270
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,320
what you should do

271
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,880
is to live your life well.

272
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,200
We have a long way to go.

273
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,520
You must be careful.

274
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
We're almost there.

275
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Get down.

276
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Take it easy.

277
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Be careful.

278
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,960
Don't show your face later.

279
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,640
If they find you,

280
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,160
it'll be a disaster.

281
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Come on.

282
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,240
Pull up.

283
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,840
Stop the car.

284
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,600
Stop.

285
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
真的是.

286
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,560
No, Master.

287
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,040
Such an order is brought to court.

288
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,440
The ship must be sailing back into Normarlo.

289
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,600
Use all the vehicles

290
00:25:51,640 --> 00:26:06,960
to pass through this

291
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,760
I'm just eating at the clinic.

292
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,960
Once the disease spreads, I can't afford it.

293
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,560
How can you talk nonsense?

294
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Check carefully.

295
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Sir!

296
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Sir, I'm here.

297
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Sir!

298
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,160
This is a corpse.

299
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,960
Check carefully.

300
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Sir!

301
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Oh no! He got infected!

302
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,760
Hurry and hide! Let them go!

303
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
Let go!

304
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Let go!

305
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
Hurry and go!

306
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Hurry and go!

307
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Let's go!

308
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Hurry and go!

309
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Go!

310
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
An Tu!

311
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Take care!

312
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Listen to me!

313
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Listen to me!

314
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Xiao Hai, we made it!

315
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Sir, what's wrong?

316
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Xiao Hai, Master reported to Wei Laoba.

317
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Luckily, he was able to save a hand.

318
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to save a hand.

319
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
It's okay.

320
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Xiao Hai.

321
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
You're leaving this.

322
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,160
You asked Master for so much money.

323
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
He gave you all the money.

324
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Song Jun signed the divorce.

325
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
He finally agreed to divorce.

326
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
He's not going to let you go.

327
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
He's not going to let you go.

328
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
You have to forgive him.

329
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
This is over.

330
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
The road to the future...

331
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Master won't leave with you.

332
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Take care.

333
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
You must take me back.

334
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Master!

335
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Hurry and go!

336
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Stop!

337
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Stop!

338
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Xiao Hai, what's wrong?

339
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Stop!

340
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Xiao Hai!

341
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Xiao Hai!

342
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Xiao Hai!

343
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Xiao Hai, Master drank Master Zhao's tea.

344
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
He can't live anymore.

345
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,560
I've lied to you for ten years.

346
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
I've always owed you a life of apology.

347
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
I'm sorry, Master.

348
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,560
He doesn't know that Master Zhao is your enemy.

349
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,560
He doesn't have to endure the pain of his heart.

350
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
I'm also very sorry.

351
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
He's more important than me.

352
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
I'm also very envious of him.

353
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
He's more important than me.

354
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Because he knows better

355
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
that it's going to be like this sooner or later.

356
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,560
But the longer I spend with you,

357
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,560
the more I'm envious of him.

358
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Master didn't raise you.

359
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,560
There's no way for me to let my disciple stand in front of me.

360
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Master has made the right decision.

361
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
As long as the feelings are true,

362
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,560
sometimes lies are not bad.

363
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Master!

364
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Master!

365
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Master!

366
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Master, Gao Ming was found dead at the gate of the city.

367
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,840
Stay with me.

368
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,200
What are you thinking?

369
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,480
I am thinking the years I am

370
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:25,320
with her regain

371
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
I also often dreamt of my mother.

372
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,320
I dreamt of the past.

373
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
Those endless times.

374
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,320
So people live in this world.

375
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,320
Happiness and happiness are all short-lived.

376
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
The bitter and bitter end of the life is the only thing in life.

377
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
I have to go back to the Eastern Xia King's Palace

378
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
to find my sister.

379
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,320
Only the Queen of Lidai

380
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,320
knows the secrets of the highest in the Eastern Xia.

381
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
But you haven't been back to the Eastern Xia for years.

382
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Your sister just became Queen of the Queen.

383
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
If she goes back now,

384
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,320
I'm afraid she will have other ideas.

385
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
The battle of the previous period

386
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
must have other relatives.

387
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,320
We can now settle down in the imperial court.

388
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Maybe we can figure out something.

389
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,320
I want to follow the path of love

390
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,320
and the love of my mother.

391
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,320
I want to be with you for a moment.

392
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,320
I want to do something in my heart.

393
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Let me hide in the wind and the sky.

394
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,320
That's the Yuren Mountain.

395
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,320
We can't come to the Eastern Xia here.

396
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Is Yuren Mountain also the mountain?

397
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,320
Yuren Mountain is the mountain that is known as the Mountain of the Mountain.

398
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,320
The one behind us is the Mountain of the Mountain.

399
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
The people of the Eastern Xia

400
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,320
will protect them if they pray in the future.

401
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,320
What's your wish?

402
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
What?

403
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
We won't be in the Liao River.

404
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,320
We hope we won't be separated forever.

405
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Yuren Mountain

406
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Come, let's change desease.

407
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Open their shop

408
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,320
Open the fake shop

409
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,320
But you shouldn't date them.

410
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Sister, it's been ten years. How are you doing?

411
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,320
She is the Tibetan sea that mother said.

412
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,320
How can a Eastern-East Princess stay with a great man?

413
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Don't move!

414
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Don't move!

415
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,320
I, the princess, have already been abolished by you.

416
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,320
I am the new queen of the East, and your sister.

417
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,320
I said you are not a princess. You are not.

418
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,320
If I say you are, then you are.

419
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
How do you know I am here?

420
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
I received a letter from the Great Yong.

421
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
It said you were taken by the Great Yong.

422
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
The city was destroyed by the East.

423
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,320
I didn't expect my sister to be a good hostage.

424
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,320
She almost became a prisoner.

425
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,320
What do you want to do in the East?

426
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Since you don't say it, then don't blame me.

427
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
Take her away.

428
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Your Highness, please eat something.

429
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,320
You haven't eaten anything for a long time.

430
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,320
You will get sick.

431
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
I know you are not a princess.

432
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
I know you are not a princess.

433
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
I know you are a princess.

434
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
I know you are not a princess.

435
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,320
I know you are not a princess.

436
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,320
Your Highness, please eat something.

437
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,320
I know you are upset.

438
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,320
If I see you like this, I don't know how sad you will be.

439
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Get up.

440
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,320
You are from the East. I don't want to make things difficult for you.

441
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

442
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
Have you ever seen my mother?

443
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,320
I know you well.

444
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,320
I have always been very worried about you.

445
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Do you know how she is now?

446
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,320
I heard she was locked up...

447
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Your Highness, here I come.

448
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Is your sister feeling better now?

449
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Where is the funeral?

450
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
In the prison.

451
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Since you have taken me and her back,

452
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
and you have been begging for help,

453
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
I think you have something to do.

454
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,320
An Tu, you are still as smart as you were when you were a child.

455
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
Leave us.

456
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Yes.

457
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
What does this mean?

458
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,320
The 18th Ministry of the East and the East are in the forest.

459
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
They have been fighting for decades.

460
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,320
They finally came to Chen Manor ten days ago.

461
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,320
But I still feel a little worried.

462
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,320
I need a prince from the East to assist the King of the East.

463
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,320
The Khan of the East, Morisa, just passed away.

464
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,320
I want you to marry him.

465
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
Morisa is already over 60 years old.

466
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,320
You are asking me to marry him?

467
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,320
Morisa is indeed a little old.

468
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,320
But her son is still very young.

469
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Do you think that these little dishes can hide the Emperor of the Great Yong?

470
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,320
He will soon know that you have taken over the Ministry of the East.

471
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,320
The East will always have the disaster of the Ice Dragon.

472
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
The Emperor of the Great Yong?

473
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
The Emperor of the Great Yong has been disbanded.

474
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
They can't even care about themselves.

475
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,320
How can they manage the Ministry of the East?

476
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
You have to marry him.

477
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,320
If you don't, you will not.

478
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
You will not.

479
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
You will marry him.

480
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,320
If you don't, you will not.

481
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Unless you want to marry my corpse.

482
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
How dare you!

483
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
I have been a ten-year-old child.

484
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
I don't owe anything.

485
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
I also don't owe anything to you.

486
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Even if I see my mother after I die,

487
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,320
I'm sure she won't blame me.

488
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,320
Is it because of that man named Zang Hai?

489
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
You like him so much?

490
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
Guards!

491
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Go and give me the finger of that man of the Great Yong!

492
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Yes.

493
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
Wait!

494
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
You didn't promise me one day.

495
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,320
I just cut his finger off one day.

496
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Even if you had promised He Qing,

497
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,320
he was already a useless person.

498
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,320
A useless person.

499
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
How could he dare to think about

500
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,320
the princess of the East?

501
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Hurry up!

502
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Yes.

503
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,320
I promise you.

504
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,320
You are still too soft-hearted.

505
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,320
You don't deserve to be the King of the East.

506
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,320
I am not a fool.

507
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,320
I am a fool.

508
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,320
I am not a fool.

509
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,320
I am a fool.

510
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,320
I am a fool.

511
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,320
I am a fool.

512
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,320
I am a fool.

513
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,320
I am a fool.

514
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,320
I am a fool.

515
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
I am a fool.

516
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,320
My and his kingdom character carves us as brothers.

517
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:46,720
Besides

518
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:53,320
My life is some joy

519
00:44:53,320 --> 00:45:23,320
The lonely moon is me, the high mountain is me, the high mountain is me, the earth is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me,

520
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,020
the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the world is me, the
