1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hey, hey, ha, ha, ha

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ha, ha, hey, hey

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey, ha, ha, ha

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ha, ha, hey, hey

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ha, ha, hey, ha, ha

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I heard that

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
there was a fierce battle in Pingjing's mansion last night.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Zhuang Luyin,

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cao Jingxian said that you wanted to kill him.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Your Majesty, if I want to kill Eunuch Cao,

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
why should I kill him in my mansion?

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Your Majesty, that's because I want to investigate the corruption case

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
of the House of Eunuch Zhuang of the Ministry of Works.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I want to investigate the Marquis' Mansion,

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but I didn't expect that you would kill him.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Everyone who is present in this case

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
has seen it with their own eyes.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I hope Your Majesty can investigate it.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Lu Gongchang, the seal.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm here.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You two were here last night.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Tell me about it.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Your Majesty, I was in the west room last night.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I saw Eunuch Cao with his guard

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
sending a birthday gift to Mr. Zhuang.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's a knife.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I had something to attend to, so I left in advance.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The rest of the wine...

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Tell me.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Your Majesty, I left with you last night.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But I heard Eunuch Cao screaming outside the Marquis' Mansion.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I saw Eunuch Cao's arm injured and ran out.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He even said that Mr. Zhuang wanted to kill him.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Wang Luoyun, what else do you have to say?

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your Majesty, when I took Chen'er's seal away,

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I was still healthy.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But when I came back,

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I became a loser who was turned into a double-leaf clover.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's going on?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,680
Eunuch Cao was the one who was in charge of the

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Imperial Guards' Mansion.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He was stubborn and refused to answer.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I punished him.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Eunuch Cao admitted that he was corrupting the treasury

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and took 30,000 taels of silver.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He wanted to frame me and try to make a country.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How could he tolerate that?

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:15,580
I heard Eunuch Cao's plan to get rid of the

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
One is the Prime Minister of the State,

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the other is the Grand Tutor of the Grand Secretariat.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He even fought in the capital.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He didn't take me and Dayong's power into his eyes.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Your Majesty, the House of Zhuang pointed out that

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
all the money he had stolen was given to Zhuang Luoyun

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
to support the army.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I was too anxious to take the blame.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was afraid that he would harm you.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Cao Jingxian used me to get rid of the three-level

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
medicine source of the imperial court.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How could I accept such a big order?

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have no intention to rebel.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Please investigate it, Your Majesty.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Your Majesty, I think it's hard to decide

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
because we haven't found out the truth yet.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Is it a hidden agenda or a false charge?

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I think it's a good idea to investigate it.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Please ask someone to check the information.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Cao Jingxian, I asked you to lead the Grand Secretariat

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
to monitor the officials and punish the criminals for me.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Zhuang Luoyun.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're a former official of my palace.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You should be a war-fighter.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You didn't come to me to discuss the matter.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Instead, you asked the soldiers to do something

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
to vent their complaints.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If the whole capital is in this situation,

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
can I still sleep every night?

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You two are both old people in the court.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You should know very well

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
who is the real one.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let me ask you again.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You two fought here in private

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
just for Zhuang's mansion?

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Please investigate it, Your Majesty.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Before I find out the truth,

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Cao Jingxian will take the power of the Grand Secretariat

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and be the one to be the leader.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Zhuang Luoyun, what do you want me to do?

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You can tell me.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Your Majesty, please.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sorry to let you go to Zhuang's mansion

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and let you be a concubine

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
for the job of the minister of the Ministry of Works.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Please forgive me.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But please, Your Majesty,

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
please forgive me for being a disabled man

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and let him live.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll do what you want.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I won't ask for more.

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm guilty

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
for making the magistrate make a mistake.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm willing to ask for punishment.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Please allow me.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll do what you want.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
As you wish.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Father,

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Zhuang Luoyun's confession

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
is indeed a great achievement.

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He's just trying to get rid of

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
His Majesty's suspicion of him.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He's just trying to get rid of

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the fact that we've been beaten

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
with cotton.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Have you found the magistrate?

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I've searched everywhere in the capital.

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I've sent people to watch him

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
on the way to the capital.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But he disappeared

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
like a sea of dead bodies.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What about his own place?

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There's no news of the clinic or the magistrate.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The magistrate even made the magistrate

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
pretend to be the magistrate

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to prevent other people from being suspicious.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Half-born builds theif.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mingxiang UNCRe scorch

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Fuze upon someplace else.

140
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,960
After all these years,

141
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,960
it's time for them to make an effort.

142
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Yes.

143
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,320
Hai.

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,640
The Eighth Young Master of Zhen House has found us.

145
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
He's not good at it.

146
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,640
What should we do?

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,280
Today, you came to report about the Education knees of the leadershipam alla

148
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,840
Prince歡迎官我們的聲音

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm sorry to bother you

150
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,200
Do you know where he is?

151
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,360
Miss Xiang is missing

152
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
What's going on?

153
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,800
He came to the mansion that day

154
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,760
Not Boss Xiang

155
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,000
The one who came that day was not Lord Zang

156
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
I was at the Marquis's banquet that day

157
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,000
I can't follow Miss Xiang's appointment

158
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,480
I can only ask the family doctor to explain to her

159
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,200
I thought Miss Xiang was sick

160
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,800
He went out that night

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,800
Where did he go?

162
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,880
Don't you know where he went?

163
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,680
I really don't know

164
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,760
Eunuch Cao had a fight with Marquis Pingjing

165
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,000
and he was in a fight

166
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,320
It was a big deal

167
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,840
I couldn't go to the clinic

168
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,080
and apologize to Miss Xiang

169
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,680
You just told me he was missing

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
I was worried too

171
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,680
If you have any other ideas

172
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,440
I'll help you find him

173
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,640
Thank you

174
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,200
He is just a fool

175
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,560
He can be like this sometimes

176
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,560
We can find him ourselves

177
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
We'll leave now

178
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,480
I hope so

179
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,440
But if you find him

180
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,120
please tell me

181
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,160
Shilei

182
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
It's written

183
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,600
Marquis Pingjing

184
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,560
rate some great books

185
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,040
Let's list a list

186
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,800
I've already covered his wounds

187
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,200
But

188
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,520
men nearby are not trustworthy

189
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,600
I should ask master forsponsor

190
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Besides, he battled Russian army Krugov

191
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,400
a day in the emperor's name

192
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,540
I can tell you

193
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,020
Li Anmen

194
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,180
was really tough

195
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,440
internal power

196
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,920
is not strong enough

197
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,440
100 table Selju

198
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,300
You are them

199
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,760
I am the grass

200
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,300
[(Let me out.)

201
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:46,360
Are my words

202
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm weak, but I don't care about my health

203
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,600
Zang Hai

204
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,080
I'm not the one you're looking for

205
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,200
You really have nothing here

206
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,080
How can you make a girl live comfortably?

207
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,680
I'll go find two sets of clothes

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,400
You two talk slowly

209
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,520
Your leg is injured?

210
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,000
Why am I a bitten man?

211
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,120
How did you get hurt?

212
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,120
It's nothing

213
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,240
You may have blisters on your leg

214
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
You colluded with Cao Jinxian

215
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,240
to steal the ghost wedding that night

216
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,240
because of your desire for the ghost wedding

217
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,240
that caused my family to die ten years ago

218
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
I came back to the capital

219
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
hoping to have a day when I could take the responsibility

220
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
I did have a date with Cao Jinxian

221
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
but it was all for the ghost wedding

222
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,240
You kept saying that I colluded with Cao Jinxian

223
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
but don't forget

224
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
I helped you kill his adopted son

225
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
If I really were on the same side with him

226
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
would you have been able to protect me until today?

227
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
You left me a life

228
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
just to play with me

229
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Yes

230
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
I am a fool

231
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Before I figure out all of this

232
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,240
I can only leave you here for the time being

233
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I am a princess of the Eastern Xia

234
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
If you treat me like this

235
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
aren't you afraid that your emperor will blame you?

236
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
I am sorry, Your Highness

237
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
How about this?

238
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
I will go to the capital

239
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
and ask for your permission

240
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
I will go to the capital

241
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
and ask for your permission

242
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
How about this?

243
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
You let me out

244
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
I will help you find your enemy

245
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
How about it?

246
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Since now

247
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
you don't trust me

248
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
then kill me now

249
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
What do you want?

250
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
I know

251
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
you are not the mastermind of the Kui family

252
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
but you are related to the Eastern Xia

253
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
I will find out the truth

254
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Okay

255
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
You go and find out

256
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
You find out

257
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
whether you want to kill me or let me go

258
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
But if you wrong me

259
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I will not spare you

260
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Father

261
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Don't kill me

262
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Don't kill me

263
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Mother, help him

264
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Father

265
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Father

266
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Father

267
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Mother is here

268
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Don't be afraid

269
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Mother

270
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
It's okay

271
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
I am so painful

272
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Don't be afraid

273
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
It's okay

274
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Why are you still standing there?

275
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Go and call the doctor

276
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Doctor

277
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Doctor

278
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
He Zhi

279
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
He Zhi

280
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Why are you here?

281
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Please forgive me

282
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Where is the doctor?

283
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Didn't you tell them to stay outside?

284
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
The second young master's injury is not healed

285
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
The doctor is waiting for him

286
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Who told you to talk?

287
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Go and call the doctor

288
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Yes

289
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Just a number

290
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
I will find him

291
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Mother

292
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
It's so painful

293
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
I am so thirsty

294
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
I know

295
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
That Zhuang Zhixian

296
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
wants to get you

297
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
I will not let him succeed

298
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
I will not let him succeed

299
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Long live the emperor

300
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Long live the emperor

301
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
Long live the emperor

302
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Long live the emperor

303
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Long live the emperor

304
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Father

305
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
You called me?

306
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Houshigang's son was in chaos

307
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
He was badly injured

308
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
He was in a coma

309
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
He was so angry

310
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
He was so angry

311
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
He was so angry

312
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
He was so angry

313
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
He was so angry

314
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
He was so angry

315
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
He was so angry

316
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,600
With Yuan Qi's great injury,

317
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,840
I lost my position as an official.

318
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,680
Your brother is also gone.

319
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,160
There's nothing left

320
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,080
except for Marquis Pingjing.

321
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,400
Father,

322
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,760
what can I do for this family?

323
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,880
To stand firm in the court,

324
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,800
you must hold on to your power.

325
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,120
Especially military power.

326
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,680
Now, my father's situation

327
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,920
is like a dream from the beginning.

328
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,080
All the hope of the Zhuang family

329
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,640
is you.

330
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,600
Although I'm just a small chess player,

331
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,200
I want to make a contribution.

332
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,400
It's not that I don't have a chance.

333
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,720
I don't regret it.

334
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,360
I'll ask General Wuyi to

335
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,040
send me to the border tomorrow.

336
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Don't go to war.

337
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,000
I have other ways.

338
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,400
Father, you mean...

339
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,640
Zhi Qing,

340
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,000
I want you to attend the dance class.

341
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,080
If you can be the general,

342
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,720
it's more useful than making any contribution.

343
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,560
General?

344
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,160
Although you've recovered,

345
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,320
you still have a weak foundation.

346
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,720
I'm afraid it's not good

347
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,480
to fight against those who are practicing martial arts.

348
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,840
You're the son of Zhuang Luyin.

349
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,080
Just let go of him.

350
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,440
Yes, father.

351
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,440
Your engine's broken.

352
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,720
My Lord, you left this morning.

353
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,320
Yes.

354
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,280
His Lordship went to the Moon-screen House.

355
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,080
Take good care of His Lordship

356
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,920
Auntie

357
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,920
Good

358
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,880
You keep watching

359
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,880
I think I look這樣

360
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,160
Why are you disturbing me?

361
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,800
Go

362
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,680
You

363
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,400
Keep going

364
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,600
Go

365
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,400
If with illness

366
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,640
you don't count on me

367
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,120
I will live with modesty

368
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,520
and high Over?)

369
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
You're a good martial artist

370
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
But it's too late

371
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
You've been in the military camp for months

372
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Although you've made great progress

373
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
But it takes at least ten years

374
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
to be a martial artist

375
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,880
I'm afraid it's hard to take the position of the leader

376
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
But I still want to compete

377
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,880
In the past, father's skills

378
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
were unbeatable for me

379
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
But now I've got it, so I can fight

380
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
But now I've got it, so I can find

381
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
he's not stable

382
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
I have to stand firm in the court

383
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Now the Zhuang family's元气 is very strong

384
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
If I can get the Wuzhuang Yuan

385
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,880
I can make the outsiders

386
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
look down on me and the Marquis

387
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
You're thinking deeper than me

388
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
What did the Marquis say?

389
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
He just told me to do my best

390
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Nothing else

391
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,880
There's half a month left

392
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
I'll practice day and night

393
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Even if there's only one hope

394
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
I'll still hold on

395
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Since you've made up your mind

396
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Then get ready

397
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Although you can't get out of the fight

398
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,880
in half a month

399
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
But the strategy and skills

400
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
can be improved quickly

401
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
I'll let Shilei train you

402
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Thank you

403
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
The first round of the strategy and skills

404
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
I've finished

405
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
The second round of the strategy and skills

406
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Wudou

407
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
Han Cheng against Shi Cang

408
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Zheng Ming Lang against Zeng Wen Xuan

409
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Ye Xing Wang against Kang Hao

410
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
Long Feihu against Zhuang Zhixing

411
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
The second round of strategy and skills

412
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,880
Great

413
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Great

414
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Fight

415
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
The final winner of Wudou

416
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
Zhuang Zhixing and Fang Lei

417
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
These two

418
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,640
will enter the Central Prefecture tomorrow

419
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,640
to fight for the fifth rank.

420
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,720
The Central Prefecture is better than the palace.

421
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,640
Whoever can lead the army

422
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,600
to bring back the golden box

423
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,520
hidden in the forest

424
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,320
will win.

425
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,360
Stop.

426
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,800
You followed me?

427
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,760
But I have something to say.

428
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,600
I found this first.

429
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,920
Here's the golden box.

430
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,240
I don't want it.

431
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,480
You're so cowardly.

432
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,680
A wise man is a wise man.

433
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,280
Compared to a veteran,

434
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,080
my life is more important.

435
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,120
You're wrong.

436
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,600
I want the golden box.

437
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,480
I don't want it.

438
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
I don't want it.

439
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
I don't want it.

440
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,640
You're wrong.

441
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,520
I want not only the golden box,

442
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
but also your life.

443
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,760
The Second Childe

444
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,040
wants the fifth rank, too.

445
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,160
The winner of the Central Prefecture

446
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,120
is Zhuang Zhixing.

447
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,760
Marquis,

448
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,760
Lord Zang is here.

449
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,040
Lord Zang.

450
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,760
Lord Zang.

451
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,840
Lord Zang.

452
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,040
Marquis.

453
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,000
Congratulations, Marquis.

454
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,800
The Second Childe has won the fifth rank.

455
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,840
The day after tomorrow,

456
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,920
the Second Childe will enter the palace

457
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,320
to receive His Majesty's memorial.

458
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,120
Tomorrow night,

459
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,760
I'll have a banquet at the Marquis's mansion.

460
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,840
Come with me.

461
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,080
I want everyone to see

462
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,600
that I have someone in the future.

463
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,600
Yes.

464
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,720
Go.

465
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,080
Marquis.

466
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,200
Anything else?

467
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,080
The Second Childe has won the fifth rank.

468
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,560
He will enter the court to be an official.

469
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,120
And the most important thing in the court

470
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,160
is his birth certificate.

471
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,240
What do you mean?

472
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,400
The Second Childe is a concubine.

473
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,440
If he has a child or a husband,

474
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,280
he will be a good man.

475
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,000
Then he will be the first son

476
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,200
of the Fuwei family.

477
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,720
The father and son are in the same boat.

478
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,160
It's a fair and just situation.

479
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,880
Marquis, you are so thoughtful.

480
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,280
Tell Zhuang Shan

481
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,240
to put Shen Wan in the family's mansion

482
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,840
before the day of the second childe.

483
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,120
Find a good day

484
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,080
to move Fen Ying back to the ancestral tomb.

485
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,760
Yes.

486
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,520
Hurry!

487
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,080
Madam.

488
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Second Young Master

489
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,760
has lost.

490
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,160
The Marquis said

491
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,880
he would make Second Young Master the Crown Prince.

492
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,520
The Crown Prince.

493
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
The Crown Prince?

494
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,400
Mother.

495
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,840
I want to be the Crown Prince, too.

496
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,280
I...

497
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,520
I want to be the Crown Prince, too.

498
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:50,880
But...

499
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,680
Ruo'er.

500
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,080
Tell me.

501
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,400
What should we do in the future?

502
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,600
Sure.

503
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,320
Okay.

504
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,600
Five hairs.

505
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Five hairs?

506
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,600
Clap well.

507
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,120
Because Éshige is like your brother

508
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,560
now.

509
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,480
If Seram is 여기는

510
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,880

Crazy.

514
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,800
So the banquet is so good.

515
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,240
Yes.

516
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Gong Xi, Marquis.

517
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,200
Gong Xi, the second brother.

518
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,960
You get the title.

519
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,280
Thanks.

520
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,920
General Huang, I'm waiting for

521
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,600
this banquet tomorrow.

522
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,640
Only then will the title be MRC.

523
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,640
According to what I heard,

524
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,360
His Majesty is satisfied with the T 일본ese dancing.

525
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,120
Marquis, please awards ceremony.

526
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,460
I think we can't delay the post of Government Governor

527
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,560

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,880

Huh.

540
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,340
Minister Hou.

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,700
Go.

542
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,360
I take on that role instead of being a soldier.

No.

549
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,120
No one can be the master of the family.

550
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,240
From now on,

551
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,440
you're the son of the Marquis.

552
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,040
No matter in the court or in the army,

553
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,360
you can't disgrace the ancestors of the family.

554
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,480
I won't let my father down.

555
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,040
I'll take the family.

556
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,840
This is your family to begin with, right?

557
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,760
Congratulations.

I've got something to tell you.

564
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,120
Yes.

565
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,520
Drink some wine.

The。。 what do we need?

570
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,400
I must thank you, sir

571
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,680
You, young lord should ...

572
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,400
thank yourself

573
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Zhuang's ancestors

574
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,000
Please bless me.

575
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,440
Please bless me to get well soon.

576
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,440
I don't want to be a fool anymore.

577
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,680
Everything out there

578
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,400
should belong to me.

579
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,480
Even if I did something wrong,

580
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,120
I should be the one to be punished.

581
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,200
I am innocent.

582
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,840
He is the legitimate son of the Zhuang family.

583
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,360
As long as he gets well soon,

584
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,760
he will be able to regain the favor of the Marquis.

585
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,040
Please bless me.

586
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,240
Madam.

587
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Why is this bitch's tablet here?

588
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Come here! Come here!

589
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,560
What's wrong with this tablet?

590
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,560
This is what His Lordship ordered

591
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,560
His Lordship also told someone to put the name in the ancestral manual

592
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,960
He said that she...

593
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,560
She is the mother of the Crown Prince

594
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,960
What?

595
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,160
He said that she is the mother of the Crown Prince

596
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,160
The Crown Prince is the legitimate heir

597
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
Your Ladyship

598
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
Your Ladyship

599
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

600
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

601
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

602
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

603
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

604
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

605
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

606
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

607
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

608
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,760
I will never forget the time when we were young.

609
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,760
The hand of the autumn is me.

610
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
The world is me.

611
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,760
The world is me.

612
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,760
You are me too.
