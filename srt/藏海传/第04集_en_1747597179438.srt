00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Ready?

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
One

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Two

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Three

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
My glasses!

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My glasses!

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I can't see!

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't move!

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll figure something out!

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Aiguo

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't think they can get out

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't worry

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go!

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You have a way

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Believe me

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Aiguo

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Lin Jinghao

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You bastard!

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I won't let you go!

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Lin Jinghao

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Go

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My lord, someone is coming out

25
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Go

26
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Report to the Marquis

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come here

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm Zang Hai

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Greetings, my lord

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How do you know

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the way to break the Jiguan in the imperial mausoleum?

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The construction of the imperial mausoleum

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
is very confidential

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Only the craftsmen

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
who built the imperial mausoleum

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
knew that

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
you were their descendant

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and wanted to steal the Jiguan

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My lord, I'm confused

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You wanted to find Mr. Feng Shui

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
who could get out of the palace alive

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but you doubted that

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
they were not real

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't you believe in Feng Shui?

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're talking nonsense

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
in front of me

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Tell me, how did you get out?

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I just broke the Jiguan

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
in the imperial mausoleum

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's rare

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
so I had to arrange it in a special way

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I used the Yizhen hand to make the formation

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and used the Nine-star Wei-Fa

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
to build the Jiguan

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So the Jiguan

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
was also arranged in this way

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know the Nine-star Wei-Fa?

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The Nine-star Wei-Fa

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The Nine-star Wei-Fa

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
is a secret skill of the official

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We common people

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
only know some tricks

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We can't compare with the officials

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm just a life-threatening person

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No matter how many people guess

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm lucky to have a good friend

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,020
How can the two-way

69
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,000
meet in the same way?

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Your big-minded study

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
can teach you some

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
traditional skills

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's your luck

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The Marquis is here

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You broke the Jiguan in the imperial mausoleum?

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Come here

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm Zhang Hai

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Greetings, Marquis

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Tell me

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Do you have a way

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
to solve the funeral of the Empress Dowager?

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Marquis

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's unknown

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm afraid he'll be in danger

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
if he does this

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's capable

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
because he can come out of the tomb

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Tell me your way

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Marquis

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The funeral of the Empress Dowager

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
will be solved

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
after a heavy rain

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why is it heavy rain?

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The water in the town is the only solution

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to solve the problem

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The rain is heavy

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The situation will be solved

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Will it rain today?

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The mountains are surrounded by the water

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like a rainstorm

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's the first day of the year

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The south is warm

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and the city is here

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Today, I saw the grass and trees are moist

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The temperature rises and the air is cold

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The rain must be like a horse

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's raining from the sky

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is he right?

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's heavy today

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but there's no sign of rain

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
According to our theory

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the rain will be half and half today

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It will rain before the time of the new year

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The Qingtian sword is responsible for the officials

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and the words should be left in place

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Unlike you, who are not good at it

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You say 50% is 10% just to deceive people

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's not 50%

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's 10%

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The rain will be like this today

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Go to the outside of the forest

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and ask Eunuch Sun to come in

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Eunuch Sun is here

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You were fine just now

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but it was raining when you saw the gate

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
My Lord

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I heard someone broke the mechanism of the forest

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think there must be some way

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I was talking about it

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Eunuch Sun

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I heard someone broke the mechanism of the forest

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think there must be some way

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I was talking about it

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're right

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The rain has stopped

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
How can you solve the problem of the funeral?

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
My Lord

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There's a conclusion to this problem

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't dare to say it

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Stop talking nonsense

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Say it

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I slept on the way here

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
When I was sleeping

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Imperial Concubine Li asked me to sleep

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
She said

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the relationship between the late emperor and the empress dowager touched the heaven

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
She said the relationship between the late emperor and the empress dowager touched the heaven

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
She was willing to fulfill the wish of the late emperor and the empress dowager

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're a villager

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why would Imperial Concubine Li dream of you?

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I was in the forest

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I was in the forest

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I was in the forest

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If Imperial Concubine Li didn't have to

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
How could I walk out without any damage?

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
How could I walk out without any damage?

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
How dare you let her say it?

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But the funeral is a big event

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Not to mention the royal family's funeral

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If we don't follow the will of the heaven

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
the late emperor will be in a state of unease

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and the empress dowager will be affected by the background of the late emperor

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
in the land of Dayong

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
East, west, south, north, and central

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
the five directions are often marked by the people

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The royal descendants will be in charge of the lantern for 49 days

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and they won't be affected by the background of the late emperor

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have a plan

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
For 300 years

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
the late emperor and empress died

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The royal descendants will be buried in the capital

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What you mean is

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the princes don't need to go back to the capital?

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They can't go back to the capital

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
For the survival of Dayong

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the royal descendants will have to take the lantern

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
especially the one guarding the east, Prince Linzi

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The Eastern dragon guard

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
will be unstable if the empress dies

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So Prince Linzi will have to take the lantern

187
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You said all these

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
because the imperial concubine is dreaming about you

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How do you know that?

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're not talking nonsense

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm telling the truth

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Imperial concubine Li loves her son so much

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and she knows the whole thing

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm not going to make things difficult for the emperor

195
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm willing to help the empress dowager and the late emperor to be buried

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
She will come back tomorrow at noon

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You can wait

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and we can see the result tomorrow

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You want me to wait for you?

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why?

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Just because of your excuse?

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
My excuse is not enough

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But if you have no better choice

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
why don't you bet on me?

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Eunuch Sun, what do you think?

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Since the imperial concubine is dreaming

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll go back to wait

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If this happens tomorrow

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I will tell the emperor the truth

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Please make your decision

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Thank you, Eunuch Sun

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Eunuch Sun

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you know who this eunuch is?

214
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
My lord

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He is the man by the emperor's side

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No matter how many feng shui masters

218
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
have made up their minds

219
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Eunuch Sun doesn't even have a single look

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But he heard what you said

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Do you know why?

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Maybe the emperor has already made up his mind

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He is indeed smart

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know what to say

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I just want to see the result

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
My lord, I have one more request

227
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Can I go to the inner palace?

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I can also reply to the imperial concubine

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You can't just go in and out of the inner palace

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Take her inside

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
My lord

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No need to say more

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's see if the imperial concubine will come back tomorrow

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Follow me

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Qu Jiao, check her identity

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This is the imperial mausoleum

238
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The big one is the late emperor's official

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The small one is the official of the imperial concubine

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You are lucky to come here

241
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Even if you die tomorrow

242
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You will never regret it

243
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
My lord

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why is there a painting of the emperor's father

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
in the main hall?

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't know

247
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I just want to see

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
My lord

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Why is there a painting of the emperor's father

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
in the main hall?

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's not in the underground

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's rare

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Have you seen enough?

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Please wait a moment

255
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I want to kowtow to the imperial concubine

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and reply

257
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Imperial concubine

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I kowtow to her

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Thank you, imperial concubine

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I will be safe

261
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,360
You've taken the wrong direction

262
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,280
You've disturbed the peace of Noble Lady

263
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,320
Can you afford it?

264
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,040
I've already

265
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,960
conveyed the wish of Noble Consort Dowager

266
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,680
and didn't fail to do so

267
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,360
Alright

268
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,640
Let's go

269
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,520
Yes

270
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,440
Master He

271
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Thank you

272
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Smile

273
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,400
Stare at me

274
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:21,960
Noble Consort Dowager

275
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Go to the burial

276
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,140
before the

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,780
to help me achieve what I want camera

278
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,080
Lord

279
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,860
The hallst bonito is on fire

280
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,820
Except what her majesty and i thought

281
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,340
A golden curtains

282
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,240
YourIGops

283
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,280
The Pot with the August Birch

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

285
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

286
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,680
You talked about His Majesty's matter on my behalf.

287
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,760
What reward do you want?

288
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,600
It's my duty to help you share your worries.

289
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,920
I dare not ask for a reward.

290
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,520
Since you don't want a reward,

291
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,680
I'll have to count your sins.

292
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,960
You should know that

293
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,800
the imperial family's funeral system has been changed.

294
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,600
It's not just a matter of money.

295
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,520
I know that

296
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,680
the imperial family's funeral system has been changed.

297
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
I'll behead you.

298
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,880
Your Highness, I dare not.

299
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
I dare not.

300
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
How about this?

301
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm a sick man.

302
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,400
I'll kill you first.

303
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,680
I'll reward you with a good coffin

304
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
and a gold and silver burial.

305
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,280
Your Highness, I came to the wilderness willingly.

306
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,480
I wasn't caught.

307
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,560
Do you know why I came?

308
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,480
I want to show that you're smart.

309
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,240
But wise people don't suffer.

310
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,360
Smart people die early.

311
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,400
I want to reward you with a meal.

312
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,920
I want to serve you.

313
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,840
There are many people who want to follow me.

314
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,960
Why should I choose you?

315
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,320
Your Highness's eldest son is an official in the Ministry of Works.

316
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,440
He has a lot of work.

317
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,200
I'll use the skills I've learned in my life

318
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,360
to build a fish tank

319
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,640
to help you and your eldest son

320
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
to make a living.

321
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Your Highness.

322
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,240
Speak.

323
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,640
I've found out his whereabouts.

324
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,520
He's from Wenzhou.

325
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,000
His parents died when he was eight.

326
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,560
He was left in Qingquan Town of Jiangning Prefecture

327
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,320
to follow a wooden general.

328
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,520
There was a fire before

329
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,040
that made him lost his way.

330
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,440
He had to find a way out north.

331
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
He just arrived in the capital a few days ago.

332
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,680
Then if he can'troom and fuck off

333
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,320
from'REither Mine'

334
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,920
those two sentences are coconut milk to you.

335
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,840
Get away first.

336
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,640
He is a Wahlmeier.

337
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,320
Thank you, my Lord.

338
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,160
Report to the Marquis I conveying news that I didn't news of the exception of account.

339
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,400
My Lord, I have one more thing to ask of you.

340
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,200
The two people who are living with Seeds and Means

341
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,600
are easier to mistake in蓋로

342
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,440
If you could'll be buddy them

343
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
I'm Zang Hai, a new staff

344
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Please let me know

345
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Wait

346
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
You are Zang Hai?

347
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
I am

348
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
This is your clothes and the badge

349
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Pack your luggage well

350
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Tomorrow, please go to the station

351
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
Yes

352
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
I'll go to the station

353
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Pack your luggage well

354
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Tomorrow, please go to the station

355
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
Yes

356
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
My good apprentice

357
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,440
You helped the emperor solve the problem

358
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
It's the will of the Imperial Concubine Li to come to the Nongguan

359
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
In this way

360
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
The emperor has both a sincere heart

361
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
and no loss of people's blood

362
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Your family Zong Qin is guarding the lanterns in the fifth emperor

363
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Just gave the emperor a reason

364
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,440
Let the kings of the kings be filial to the emperor

365
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Especially King Linzi

366
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
If King Linzi returns to the capital to die

367
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm afraid it will be stupid

368
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
You basically solved it

369
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
The possibility of the king returning to the capital to make trouble

370
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
I still don't understand

371
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Why is it raining so hard?

372
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,440
The fruit of the Imperial Concubine Li's coffin fell

373
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Tell me about it

374
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
This matter

375
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Not as complicated as you think

376
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
When I first entered the forest

377
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
I found that the ground was flooded

378
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
There are still golden and light fruits

379
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,440
And the rock used to fix the light fruit is not strong

380
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
If at this time

381
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Just the right time

382
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
The golden fruit will be broken

383
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
If at this time

384
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
There is a piece of golden wood

385
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Under the light fruit

386
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Changed the balance of light fruit

387
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
In addition to the heavy rain

388
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
The ground water is slow

389
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Under the heavy rain

390
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,440
The Imperial Concubine Li will naturally feel cool

391
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,440
You are the real boat of Xing Dou

392
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
I just didn't expect

393
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
The corrupt wind of the court

394
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
It's so serious

395
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Even the repair of the imperial forest dares to make a simple effort

396
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Now found out

397
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
You can take a good rest

398
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
They are all greedy for the emperor

399
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Don't look at them

400
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
To the emperor

401
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Three expensive wine

402
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Long live the emperor

403
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
What's in my heart

404
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
It's all the doorkeeper's secret

405
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
If my father is still alive

406
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Seeing the Qing Tian Sword that is now polluted

407
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
How uncomfortable it would be

408
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Anyway

409
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Your first step was very successful

410
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
In front of Ping Jing Hou

411
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Great

412
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
what happened

413
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Yesterday, Ping Jing Hou put his hand on my shoulder

414
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
I can't lift my hand up half

415
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Master helped you rub

416
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Uncle, you are light

417
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Come on, hold on

418
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
I finally understand now

419
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
Why the benefactor doesn't let me wash the martial arts

420
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
This Ping Jing Hou dare to let me leave him so close

421
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,440
He must be very confident about his martial arts

422
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
But he also pressed my shoulder

423
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,440
It can be seen how cautious this person is

424
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
He has exquisite guards by his side

425
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Always wearing gold and silk soft armor

426
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Use the best of the best

427
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
May not be able to enter his body

428
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Even if you learn martial arts

429
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
I'm afraid he will kill you if you don't have a good sword

430
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Use your strength to win

431
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
It's for the next step

432
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Forget it

433
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Anyway, I finally entered the Hou Mansion

434
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
Let's have a meal

435
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
After entering the Hou Mansion

436
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
I will check again

437
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
Wait for the right time

438
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Come to the inn if you have something to do

439
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Don't show your temper

440
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Master

441
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
Usually I'm not by your side

442
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
What are you doing

443
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
If you are not my master

444
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Where will you be

445
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
What will you do

446
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Of course I have my own business

447
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
If it's not revenge with you

448
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
I'm very free

449
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
When I came out

450
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Master Xing said to me

451
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,440
The identity of the benefactor and the three masters

452
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Can come to ask you

453
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Want to know

454
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
This meal you treat

455
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Master

456
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm still young

457
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Can I have a meal

458
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
I'm old

459
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Still empty

460
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Isn't it more pitiful

461
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Take it back

462
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
Row

463
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Can you say it

464
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Of course I can tell you

465
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
But it's not the time yet

466
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
I have to

467
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Again

468
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Give me back the silver

469
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Ice is not a lie

470
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
The ginger is still old

471
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
You are the new staff

472
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
I'm Zang Hai

473
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
My name is Hui Jian

474
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Also a staff of the Hou family

475
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
I've been here for two years earlier than you

476
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
From now on

477
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
We are colleagues

478
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
I'm not a staff

479
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm a staff

480
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
I'm a staff

481
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm a staff

482
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
It's okay

483
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm a staff

484
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
I'm a staff

485
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
I'm not in a staff

486
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,140
We'll take march to ask me

487
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,920
Mr. Platon

488
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Xiaohui

489
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Whenever you fall

490
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Do a shoulder good

491
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Anything else

492
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
people

493
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
trembling

494
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,940
Young Master

495
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,440
Let me explain

496
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Y mimosa

497
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Come with me.

498
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,240
Let me tell you the rules.

499
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,640
The door you just entered

500
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,240
is always open and closed.

501
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,040
It's only for the servants in the marquis' mansion.

502
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,240
The main door is for the marquis and his family.

503
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,040
Besides,

504
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,640
it's only open for half an hour during the festival.

505
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Our staff

506
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,440
will be in the office from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day.

507
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,040
They will be on duty from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

508
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,440
and have dinner at the room on the east side.

509
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,840
They can only sleep after the evening class.

510
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,240
One time they workobi

511
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,320
at the room on the east side within an hour.

512
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,240
They only have two or three nights.

513
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,640
Under the positions of得大 époule,

514
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,640
the continues on the east floor of the house will be several days.

515
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,840
Read all the rooms and stop at 1 p.m.

516
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,240
If you don't know where to livw in the rooms,

517
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
you have to pick key rooms where they can sleep.

518
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,640
For the plan...

519
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,240
Let's do this.

520
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,040
Remember?

521
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,140
Alright.

522
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Thank you, Brother Jian.

523
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,020
Brother Chu.

524
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,060
It's a good thing that

525
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
the young talent is here in the Marquis's mansion.

526
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,340
Why are you so worried?

527
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,500
I've seen this Zang Hai in the imperial mausoleum.

528
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,220
He's smart and cautious.

529
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,380
Brother Liang,

530
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,500
you can't be too careful with him.

531
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,620
Brother Chu, you're worrying too much.

532
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,620
As long as he can help the Marquis,

533
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,620
I can't be too grateful.

534
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,100
Why should I worry?

535
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,100
You and I haven't solved

536
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,380
the problem of the Empress Dowager's funeral.

537
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,460
But a Zang Hai

538
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,940
who doesn't know where he came from

539
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,660
has solved it.

540
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,100
As long as I dare to take the risk,

541
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,980
I can easily solve it.

542
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,460
But this matter

543
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,540
must be a good thing

544
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,700
and a bad thing.

545
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,060
You and I don't need to do this.

546
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,340
He's still young.

547
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,780
For the future prosperity and wealth,

548
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,580
it's normal to bet on him.

549
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,540
So,

550
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,780
he's like

551
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,180
Lord Yang when he was young.

552
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,340
I think he's ambitious.

553
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,700
I'm afraid he won't interfere

554
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,460
in Lord Yang's affairs in the future.

555
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,780
You're so young.

556
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,900
You know what to do.

557
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,180
I, Yang Zheng,

558
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,500
will return to my hometown

559
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,540
and retire from the position of the Prime Minister.

560
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,820
But I heard

561
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,620
he's good at

562
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,220
keeping the water dry.

563
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,020
I think you're not worried about me.

564
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,660
You should worry about yourself.

565
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,620
General,

566
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,700
I'll let you go.

567
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,500
But,

568
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,820
one more round.

569
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,660
Brother Qu,

570
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,100
there's a new staff in the Marquis's mansion.

571
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,460
I'm the manager of the Sheren Mansion.

572
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,860
I won't go to say hello.

573
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,140
It's a little awkward.

574
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,780
I'll leave first.

575
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,340
Okay.

576
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,060
This is the Academy.

577
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,340
It's where

578
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,100
the staffs live.

579
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,060
Lord Yang ordered

580
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,500
to record

581
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,060
the skills of the Marquis.

582
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,180
Every now and then,

583
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,860
he'll choose a family

584
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,100
and give it to the Marquis.

585
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,660
In the future,

586
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,060
you should be like us.

587
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,100
Lord Yang

588
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,700
has the whole story.

589
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,300
If the Marquis wants to try it,

590
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,660
it's the same.

591
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,660
What are you thinking about?

592
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,620
Do you want the Marquis to remember

593
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,700
dozens of things?

594
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,500
It's annoying.

595
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,820
Lord Yang

596
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,300
will arrange the rules of the ceremony.

597
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,780
The staffs will each say a few words.

598
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,060
He'll let people record it

599
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,580
and present it well.

600
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,060
It's not enough.

601
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,540
In the end,

602
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,660
we don't know

603
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,820
who the Marquis chose.

604
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,140
Because in the end,

605
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,620
it's Lord Yang's decision.

606
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,740
The Marquis is the heir to the throne.

607
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,740
So he's called the Shigen.

608
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,900
So the Marquis' Academy

609
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,380
is named the Zhuang family.

610
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,820
I'm going to see him.

611
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,140
Lord Yang.

612
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,300
Ghost Sword,

613
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,300
leave us.

614
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,140
Yes.

615
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,540
You're pena

616
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,660
who periodically drinks water

617
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,940
to stance the Marquis.

618
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:10,980
I, Szanghai,

619
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,620
bow before Lord Yang.

620
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,380
A talented young man.

621
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,460
You have gotten such talents.

622
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,500
It's the blessings of divine nature.

623
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,860
I've just told you

624
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,860
Yes

625
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,900
The rules here

626
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,220
are much more important than those of the Imperial College and the Zha-Democratic Office

627
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,460
But you've built up the rules here

628
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,220
You won't make mistakes

629
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,660
when you get to the court

630
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,380
and you won't embarrass the Marquis

631
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,140
Mr. Yang means

632
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,460
we still have a chance

633
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,940
to enter the court and be the officials

634
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,580
Of course

635
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,060
The Marquis' Office

636
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,540
is to promote the national power and promote the national power

637
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,540
I'm afraid

638
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,740
you'll be here

639
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,180
for too long

640
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,820
But you scholars

641
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,140
know how to deal with

642
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,780
the Marquis' general

643
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,420
If you don't be careful, you'll be punished by the military order

644
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,420
If you don't be careful,

645
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,620
you'll lose your life

646
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,780
If I don't protect you,

647
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,460
who else can protect you?

648
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,540
You're so thoughtful

649
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,060
Why did I ask them to

650
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,540
decorate the house here?

651
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,220
To let them know more about the Marquis

652
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,980
and know his hobby

653
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,980
so that they won't be distracted by him

654
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,700
As long as the time is right,

655
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,780
I'll introduce them to you

656
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,380
and get the promotion of the Marquis

657
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,500
I see

658
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,980
I'm flattered

659
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,940
You're going to be the emperor's talent today

660
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,060
In the Marquis' Office from now on,

661
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
I'll be able to get the promotion

662
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,140
Lord Yang

663
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,060
The Marquis asked if there was a

664
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,540
woodlion named Zang Hai

665
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,980
who came to report today

666
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,740
What's the matter?

667
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,660
The Marquis asked him to check the fengshui of the inner garden

668
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,660
I see

669
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,900
Zang Hai is here

670
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,460
Go now

671
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,860
Yes

672
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,780
By the way,

673
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,140
I almost forgot about an important thing

674
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,260
It rained yesterday

675
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,100
and the ancestral hall was flooded

676
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,260
The Marquis asked me to find someone to repair the house

677
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,720
But the ancestral hall is full of

678
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,620
old-fashioned ways

679
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,980
I looked for a long time

680
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,380
but I couldn't find the craftsmen of Huizhen Gate

681
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,180
When it rained again,

682
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,020
the ancestral tablet of the ancestral hall

683
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,380
would be damaged again

684
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,180
I heard that you know how to watch the rain

685
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,220
I wonder if you can repair the old house

686
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,700
I know a little about the way to watch the rain

687
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,260
Maybe I can help you

688
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,780
That's great

689
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,060
I'm afraid it's going to rain heavily today

690
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,820
I don't know if it's still too late

691
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,860
Forget it

692
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,540
It's important to see the Marquis

693
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,540
Don't delay it

694
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,060
If the Marquis blames me,

695
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,460
I'll be in charge of the old affairs

696
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,620
I can't get you involved

697
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,820
The ancestral hall is shared by the ancestors of the Zhuang family

698
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,780
Dayong is filial to the world

699
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,340
The Marquis is also a sincere and sincere person

700
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,980
If I let the ancestral hall be repaired

701
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,140
and the ancestors of the Zhuang family are damaged,

702
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,460
I will be greatly lost

703
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,020
But the Marquis

704
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,420
Please reply to the Marquis for me

705
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,220
I'm afraid I can't watch the garden for the Marquis today

706
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,340
Don't worry

707
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,700
I will listen to you

708
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,700
Thank you, Lord Yang

709
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,100
Go

710
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,700
You didn't see Ping Jinghong?

711
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,260
The Marquis's guard is very strict

712
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,020
Ping Jinghong is indeed a good man

713
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,980
He has killed too many people in his life

714
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,700
He is afraid of others killing him

715
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,820
I looked closely at the sunrise and the clouds

716
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,100
It will rain heavily that night

717
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,380
If I let him go

718
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,420
the ancestral hall will be damaged

719
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,540
When the sun rises

720
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,820
and I go to Ping Jinghong to check on him

721
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,460
I will be in a very bad situation

722
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,900
So I chose to retreat

723
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,420
but I also missed the good opportunity

724
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,180
These days

725
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,780
Ping Jinghong has never looked for me again

726
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,980
It's normal for a man to forget his wife

727
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,860
Ping Jinghong is a man of great memory

728
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,980
He remembered you on the first day

729
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,900
On the second day

730
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,660
he may still remember you

731
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,100
On the third day

732
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,140
he completely forgot you

733
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,020
Yang Zhen knows him too well

734
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,540
He knows that if you don't hold on to the first chance

735
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,420
it will be hard to break through

736
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,300
You are right

737
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,820
Yang Zhen looks like a good man

738
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,120
He is hypocritical and

739
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,780
he is firmly in charge of the Sheren Mansion

740
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:45,900
He has taken all the wood

741
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,700
he has taken all the wood

742
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,700
and put them in his own hands

743
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,860
to give them a good chance

744
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,380
In fact, he raised them

745
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,820
into useless people

746
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,220
What I want to do is to remove Yang Zhen

747
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,660
and replace him

748
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,740
How many times has it been changed?

749
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,860
When will it be changed?

750
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,060
People

751
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,020
Guards

752
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,100
Stop the flower art

753
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,140
After His Lordship came into the palace today

754
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,220
His Majesty gave him treasures

755
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,180
You move the smaller acquisition into the warehouse

756
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,580
Guo En, Ren Shang

757
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,620

799
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,860
You are a delicate person

You have worked hard

807
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,860
After this person comes out

809
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,860
