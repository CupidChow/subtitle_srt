1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
They're coming back to the legs!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So he's gone ducked out on his own?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,980
We know about Asta.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,980
But these neutralsteals...

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,980
Why is that for sure?!

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,960
He hasn't yet?

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,000
Foil could be useful...

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,200
freelilies?

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,020
What hurts the most when you can't do anything good...

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,020
And how set ye fight!

11
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,020
Episode 14

12
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,020
I didn't expect you to be alive.

13
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,020
I really want to see you and Gao Ming.

14
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,020
You can go back with me.

15
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,020
I have a lot of time.

16
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,020
I can talk to you slowly.

17
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,020
Take him away.

18
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,020
Episode 14

19
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,020
General.

20
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,020
General Zhuang is really important.

21
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,020
He caught the court's drug so quickly.

22
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,020
I'm just a master of the village.

23
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,020
I dare not go to the palace.

24
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
No need to apologize.

25
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,020
I brought you a good news this time.

26
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,020
Prince Ling's son, Chengxi's throne.

27
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,020
I especially mentioned to His Majesty that you are a wise man.

28
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,020
His Majesty thinks you are a good man.

29
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,020
He especially thinks of you as a general.

30
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

31
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,020
When your father was just a general,

32
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,020
you were much older than you.

33
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,020
You have already surpassed him.

34
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,020
I will not let you down.

35
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,020
But your father was the most regretful one.

36
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,020
He didn't have the chance to chase after you.

37
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,020
He didn't have the chance to chase after you.

38
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,020
That's why you are so cruel.

39
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,020
Of course, it's because the late emperor was too selfish.

40
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,020
But now, your chance has come.

41
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:09,020
You have to sacrifice your father's will to do something about him.

42
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,020
You mean to take the troops to the east?

43
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,020
To make them have the courage to sacrifice their will?

44
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,020
That's right.

45
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,020
Now, it's the best time.

46
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,020
But I have a good army.

47
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,020
If I want to fight against the east,

48
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,020
I need the Yuan Army of the court.

49
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,020
I brought the Yuan Army to you this time.

50
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
Report!

51
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,020
Your Excellency, I found him in the main hall.

52
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,020
He has been in the room.

53
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,020
Zhuang Zhi Xing, is this what you want?

54
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,020
You will be in the same position as your father.

55
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Didn't my father die because of you?

56
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,020
You are so mean.

57
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,020
If it weren't for you, my Zhuang family would have become like this.

58
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,020
You are now a general of Zhao Yi.

59
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Why do you want to sue him?

60
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,020
Why do you want to be the criminal of the Great Yong?

61
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,020
If I were not a general,

62
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,020
I would not have had the chance to live today.

63
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,020
I had told you that I want the Zhuang family.

64
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,020
That's great.

65
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,020
You are a good person.

66
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,020
You will fight against the enemy.

67
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,020
You are like a child.

68
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
Zhang Hai.

69
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,020
The Emperor of the Ming and Hu Da.

70
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,020
You can find him.

71
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,020
He is as good as your father.

72
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,020
How can you use a ghost to summon the soldiers?

73
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,020
I have been thinking for a long time.

74
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,020
He used to be a real man.

75
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,020
He is a real man.

76
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,020
He is a real man.

77
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
He is a real man.

78
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,020
So he used to be like this.

79
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,020
The Queen of the East had such a treasure.

80
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,020
He even defeated the Great Yong.

81
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,020
I will teach you how to use it.

82
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,020
The Queen of the East

83
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,020
The Queen of the West

Your Excellency!

154
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,440
Take him down.

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,500
Yes.

156
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
уль and Rangers report.

157
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,440
The Winter is not long.

158
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,480
Everything is transporting and transporting.

159
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,400
While being in taiye,

160
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,880
search all antes action thoroughly!

161
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,520
Make sure your eає are safe.

162
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,480
Yes!

163
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
You've already expected it.

164
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Although you didn't say anything before,

165
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,440
I can see that you're hiding something from me.

166
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
You want to know it?

167
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
It's all in Zhang Mian's plan.

168
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,440
You already know where the Yin Army is coming from.

169
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
What else do you want?

170
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,440
I want to know why the Yin Army has become like this now.

171
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Why can't it be controlled?

172
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Why can't it be controlled?

173
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,440
This side has been moved by you.

174
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
You've moved your hands.

175
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Did you think of something?

176
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Ming Lv Hu Da used the idea of the Zhang Mian

177
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
to use the Ghost-Rising.

178
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,440
The Yin Army destroyed the army of the Great Yong of the Ice Forest.

179
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Only one will be turned into a new army.

180
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,440
But Ming Lv Hu Da died not long after.

181
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,440
He ordered Zhang Mian to seal the Ghost-Rising.

182
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
He was never to use it.

183
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Is there something missing in this?

184
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
I've lost one night.

185
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,440
But that night, it's useless to look at it.

186
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,440
What else did he write?

187
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Zhang Mian said that the Ghost-Rising turned into the Yin Army's army.

188
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Although it's powerful and invincible, it's not a sword.

189
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
But it will slowly lose consciousness.

190
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,440
In the end, it became a blame for the enemy.

191
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Ming Lv Hu Da caused more disaster to stop them

192
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,440
from using his own life to stop the Ghost-Rising.

193
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
The legend says that the Yin Army

194
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,440
is trying to hide the truth from the East.

195
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
If you really say that,

196
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
why did you tear off the paper?

197
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,440
You dare not let me see it?

198
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Those are just rumors that are not true.

199
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
The rumors of the three of them.

200
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,440
The Yin Army is the one you saw.

201
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
It can't be controlled.

202
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,440
It can't stand up for you from the bottom of its heart.

203
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
It can't be controlled?

204
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,440
The more you deny it, the more it proves that you want to hide something.

205
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,440
I'm afraid the paper is the one that's trying to control them.

206
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,440
You're afraid that the truth in this book

207
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
will be brought out.

208
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,440
But you still lost your mind.

209
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
You don't want to believe it?

210
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
What else can you do?

211
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Are you forcing me to say it out loud?

212
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Or are you killing me?

213
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
I don't need to do that.

214
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Since you brought it out from there,

215
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
I'm afraid that the secret is still hidden under there.

216
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
There's nothing there.

217
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
You went there for nothing.

218
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Why are you so nervous?

219
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
I used to think that

220
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,440
the throne is just a bet.

221
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Now it seems that I really have to go there.

222
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Let's go.

223
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,440
I'll escort you to the east-west west of the lowlands.

224
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Okay.

225
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Your Majesty, we haven't had a good rest these days.

226
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Be careful.

227
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,440
If this key was left by you before the princess left,

228
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
it would be useful to the wind.

229
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
It'll be good if it's hot.

230
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
Don't mention it to me.

231
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Bring it up.

232
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
He Qing, you're here.

233
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,440
You broke Dong Xia and Hai Dong Bu's contract.

234
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
And you're back.

235
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,440
I'm here to save you.

236
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
What are you talking about?

237
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,440
I've already got Da Yong's hand in the manor,

238
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,440
and he'll soon be going to take over Dong Xia.

239
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
You're here to see me?

240
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
That's why you're saying that?

241
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Last time, he wrote a letter to remind me

242
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
that you ran back to the East

243
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
and didn't return the plan.

244
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
No wonder you were so fast

245
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
that you found me and Zang Hai.

246
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,440
Zhao Bingwen is killing people in the streets.

247
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
To be honest,

248
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Zhao Bingwen came to the East

249
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
to see me.

250
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
The Great Wall of the East

251
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
is the only place

252
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
that Zhao Bingwen,

253
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
as the head of the Inner Council,

254
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
came to see me

255
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
and discussed with me.

256
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
He brought the ghost blood to the East.

257
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
He wanted to use the ghost blood

258
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
not for He Ping.

259
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
He wanted to see you

260
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
and to help you

261
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
so that you can't fight back.

262
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

263
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Mingyi Xiang An Tu.

265
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
Do you want to see

266
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
me and the Great Wall of the East

267
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
to be the criminal

268
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
who ruined the East and Great Wall of the East?

269
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
I've told you before.

270
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
I'm not interested in the King.

271
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
If you don't believe me,

272
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
you can lock me up.

273
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
But you can't ruin Zhao Bingwen.

274
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Do you think you're very stubborn?

275
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
I hate the way you look.

276
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
You're the one who's so stubborn.

277
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
You don't know how terrible the ghost blood

278
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
and the cause of the war.

279
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
They can bring great disaster

280
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
and ruin the East and Great Wall of the East.

281
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
By then,

282
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
even the family is gone.

283
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
What's the point of this throne?

284
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
I found the holy place of the ghost blood

285
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
and understood

286
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
why the King was hiding it.

287
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
I wanted to take the ghost blood

288
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
and not to use it again.

289
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
Sister.

290
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
You're the King of the East.

291
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
You're the people here.

292
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
You must save them.

293
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
You can't go in.

294
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.

295
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Don't lie to me.

296
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Since you can walk out safely,

297
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
why can't I?

298
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
You all stay here.

299
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Yes.

300
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,440
This is the place where the ghost blood was taken.

302
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
The soldiers should come from here.

303
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Master.

304
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Master.

305
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Come out.

306
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Master.

307
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,440
You're really a ghost.

308
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
What are you afraid of?

309
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Go over there.

310
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Give it to him.

311
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Come.

312
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
You've been trying to know

313
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
what I wrote in the night I was dead.

314
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
You thought it would work.

315
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,440
The truth is in those paintings.

316
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Master.

317
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Master.

318
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Didn't you tell me

319
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
to tell the truth and lie to people?

320
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
I wrote the letter

321
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
in the paper.

322
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
The soldiers

323
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
couldn't be controlled.

324
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
They only brought disaster.

325
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Shut up.

326
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
You can't use ghost blood

327
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
to fulfill your own goal.

328
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Master.

329
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Zang Hai.

330
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Ghost blood.

331
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
It's in my hands.

332
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Now,

333
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
do you want to kill me with words?

334
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Are you being too naive?

335
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Master.

336
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Do you want to go down

337
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
and see how the old man is doing?

338
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
You asked us to stay.

339
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Don't do anything wrong.

340
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm still a little worried.

341
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
Are you worried about Mr. Zhao

342
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
or Zang Hai?

343
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
How dare you attack the court!

344
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
You can push the people down.

345
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
You think you can't let

346
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
the princess go?

347
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Now, you're all here.

348
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
What a coincidence.

349
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
You always think

350
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm too obsessed with revenge.

351
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,440
But what's wrong with you?

352
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Even if I tell you the truth,

353
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
you'll never believe it.

354
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
That's why you're here.

355
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
You want to know

356
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
how to manipulate the soldiers?

357
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
You should take a good look.

358
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,440
How can you listen to me?

359
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Master.

360
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Master.

361
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Master.

362
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
Master.

363
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Goodbye, uncle.

364
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Master.

365
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
Master.

366
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
You're finally here.

367
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Where is Zang Hai?

368
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
He and Zhao Bingwen are down there.

369
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Hurry up.

370
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Are you okay?

371
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
I'm fine.

372
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Master.

373
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,440
I'm going to find her.

374
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,440
I'll let the people stop using ghost-washing.

375
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Even you think you're right.

376
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
I'll tell you

377
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
that the ghost-washing has been destroyed.

378
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Zhao Bingwen will be the next one.

379
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
I'll tell you,

380
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,440
I'll tell you

381
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
that Zhao Bingwen will be the next one.

382
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
I'll tell you that

383
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
I'll tell you that

384
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Zhao Bingwen will be the next one.

385
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
I'll tell you that

386
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Zhao Bingwen is the one who killed him.

387
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Ghost-washing has too many secrets.

388
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
What kind of power is hidden in it?

389
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
You still don't know.

390
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,440
But if we keep it in the world,

391
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,440
it will be a problem.

392
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
It's a matter of life.

393
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
I need to find a way

394
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
to make it clear.

395
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,440
And let it disappear from this world.

396
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Go.

397
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,440
I thought

398
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,440
I won't be able to go back to the capital again.

399
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
General Zhuang has a good life.

400
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
The new emperor wants you to go back to the capital.

401
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
It's a good thing that

402
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
you've got the chance to go back to the capital.

403
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Zhao Bingwen's actions

404
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
are very important to us.

405
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,440
His Majesty has also given you the position of official.

406
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Mr. Zhang,

407
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,440
I hope you can help me in the future.

408
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Zhang Hai,

409
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,440
do you want to compete with me?

410
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,440
Are you sure?

411
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
You're the general of the horse-riding race.

412
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,440
How can you compete with me?

413
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
You're not bad at horse riding.

414
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,800
One, two, three, and

415
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,560
four!

416
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Fuck!

417
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,460
His Majesty won.

418
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,460
I've found His Majesty's letter.

419
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,460
Since you're here,

420
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,460
let's play the next game.

421
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,460
I'm not good at playing.

422
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,460
I dare not play against His Majesty.

423
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,460
It's okay.

424
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,460
I'm also good at playing.

425
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
When I was still in the palace,

426
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,460
I heard that you not only studied a lot,

427
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
but also worked in the art world.

428
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
You're also talented.

429
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,460
Your Majesty, you're too much.

430
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
I was born in a different family.

431
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
I'm just a little bit of a rascal.

432
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
You don't have to be so self-righteous.

433
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,460
I heard that you're very fond of the late Emperor.

434
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,460
What are these?

435
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,460
Your Majesty, these were made by the late Emperor.

436
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,460
I just cleaned them up.

437
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
Zeng Hai,

438
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,460
how do you think I should deal with these things?

439
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,460
I heard all the things in the palace about His Majesty.

440
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,460
The late Emperor likes to be a mother.

441
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,460
It's a matter of love.

442
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,460
Take the late Emperor's money and burn it.

443
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
Yes.

444
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Zeng Hai,

445
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,460
you created a prison for me.

446
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
What reward do you want?

447
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Your Majesty,

448
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,460
I indeed have a request.

449
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,460
The former Emperor, Qing Tian Jian, is a quick-witted man.

450
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,460
The Central Military Army loves the country.

451
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,460
He was killed by Zhao Binwen.

452
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,460
Please tell the world about this matter.

453
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,460
This is what we should do.

454
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,460
We can't get any rewards.

455
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,460
Besides the son, what else do you want?

456
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,460
Your Majesty, I want to ask for your help.

457
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Zeng Hai,

458
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,460
I'm a first-class person.

459
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,460
I'm a person of the people.

460
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,460
I wanted you to return to the Inner Pavilion

461
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,460
to help me investigate the officials and the officials.

462
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,460
Would you not like to?

463
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,460
I've been in the imperial court since I was a child.

464
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,460
I've been in the imperial prison for a long time.

465
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,460
I'm afraid that I won't be here and be in the imperial court.

466
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,460
I'm still here.

467
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,460
I've already been in the imperial court.

468
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
I hope you'll be with me.

469
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,460
You've made it clear.

470
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,460
Fine.

471
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,460
Since you've made up your mind,

472
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
I can't keep you.

473
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,460
Come.

474
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,460
Let me finish this.

475
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Zeng Hai.

476
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,460
Hai has returned from the Eastern Xia.

477
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
He didn't only defeat Zhao Binwen,

478
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,460
but also took back the Ghost Blood.

479
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,460
Your disciple is so good.

480
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,460
You're such a great teacher.

481
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,460
You've lived for ten years with your name.

482
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,460
It's a good place to hide in the water.

483
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,460
It's a good place to hide in the water.

484
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,460
I still can't get used to this sweet wine.

485
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,460
Let's go.

486
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,460
Miss, I have the best wine here.

487
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,460
Do you like it?

488
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,460
I'll take a look.

489
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Is this really the end?

490
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
What?

491
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,460
I can't return it to you.

492
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,460
I went to see His Majesty while you were looking for it.

493
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,460
I went to see the emperor.

494
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,460
I was looking for the emperor.

495
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,460
I was looking for the emperor.

496
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,460
I was looking for the emperor.

497
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
I went to see the prince.

498
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,460
Prince?

499
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,460
Did he give someone another letter?

500
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,460
No, it's a letter from the teacher.

501
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,460
He's a female teacher in the university.

502
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,460
He didn't even think of telling me.

503
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,460
He was taken away by his students.

504
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
Let's go.

505
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
Hai.

506
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,460
You're right.

507
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,460
Hai.

508
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Hai.

509
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Mr. Zhang.

510
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
Mr. Zhang.

511
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,460
Are these all the things Mr. Zhang left us?

512
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,460
Where did he go?

513
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,460
Hai left.

514
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,460
I don't know when we'll meet again.

515
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,460
Then let's go to see Mr. Zhang.

516
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
How?

517
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,460
Listen.

518
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,460
Hai is very clear about it.

519
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,460
We have something to do.

520
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,460
Sir.

521
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,460
Please.

522
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,460
Your Highness.

523
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Your Highness.

524
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,460
Your Highness.

525
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,460
Your Highness.

526
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
Your Highness.

527
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,460
Hai.

528
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,460
Your Highness.

529
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,460
Hai.

530
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,460
Hai.

531
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,460
Hai.

532
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,460
You're me.

533
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,460
You're me too.
