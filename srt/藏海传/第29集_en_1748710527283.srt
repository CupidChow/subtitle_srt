1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm just going to try to get the key to the door.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if I can see it, but I'm not sure.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm just going to try to get the key to the door.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if I can see it, but I'm not sure.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can see it, but I'm not sure.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can see it, but I'm not sure.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can see it, but I'm not sure.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can see it, but I'm not sure.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can see it, but I'm not sure.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if the key here is different from the key.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can see it, but I'm not sure.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Just go back to the 3rd key.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Check it out when you see the key.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's move on to the 4th key.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Check it out when you see the key.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,160
The Emperor's

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,000
Episode 1

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,160
The Emperor's

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,760
Episode 1

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,960
The Emperor's

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Episode 1

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
The Emperor's

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
Episode 1

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,960
The Emperor's

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,960
Episode 1

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
The Emperor's

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
Episode 1

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
My dear everyone,

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,960
His Majesty is a little tired today.

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
He won't go to the court.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,960
His Majesty is not in love.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,040
The imperial physician has been treated.

34
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,040
He can rest for a few days.

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,040
But the Emperor won't go to the court.

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,040
He has the royal palace.

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Why is he not here today?

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Why is he not here today?

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
My dear everyone, please go back.

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,040
My dear everyone, please go back.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,040
The Emperor's

42
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
The Emperor's

43
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
Lord Lyu,

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,040
the things we have to do

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
are like the local script.

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Lord Lyu

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
The Emperor's

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Lord Lyu

49
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
The Emperor's

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Lord Lyu

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Please don't be polite.

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Let's go and talk.

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
I just came out

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
from the Hanjiang Palace.

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
How is His Majesty?

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,120
It's fine.

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
I was still at the Hanjiang Palace

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,120
just now.

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,120
I was wondering if he was the one who stole the Baiyanese.

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Do you want to know

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
why Cao Jingxian came here today?

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
I dare not ask more.

63
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Dare not ask more?

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Then I will tell you.

65
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,120
Didn't Cao Jingxian make you suffer before?

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,120
You must be happy

67
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,120
to hear this news.

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
I heard that

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
a big thing happened last night.

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Cao Jingxian was assassinated

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
and was killed.

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
His Majesty wanted to kill him

73
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
with the best medicine.

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
But Cao Jingxian

75
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
didn't know

76
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
if he could meet the sun of the morning.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Why are you not

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
surprised at all?

79
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
You knew

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
that it was not possible.

81
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
I was just thinking

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
that the Cao family was under the strict guard.

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
The Duke Cao has a bodyguard

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
and how could the assassin get it?

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,280
You shouldn't ask

86
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
who was the one who assassinated Cao Jingxian first.

87
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Your Highness, you don't think

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
the Duke Cao has no enemies, do you?

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,280
You said that the assassin was a good dancer.

90
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
You even asked him to run away.

91
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Then there are some things that Du Weisi is busy with.

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,280
I just hope that

93
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
they don't get caught by the wrong people.

94
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
It's strange that it's strange here.

95
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Here, Du Weisi

96
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
doesn't even have the skills to catch people.

97
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Oh, that's why.

98
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm not sure.

99
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
But your reaction

100
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
is so interesting.

101
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Are you hoping that he will die?

102
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Your Highness, what should I do?

103
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
It's okay. I'm hoping that he will die.

104
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,320
Du Weisi is here.

105
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Father,

106
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
I should take the medicine.

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Father.

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
What do you have to find?

109
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
We have tried to bribe him.

110
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I cant even think enough.

111
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,160
Hey,

112
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,920
how much box do you hear?

113
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,920
How much should we pay the money for our shots?

114
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
We'll pay you.

115
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,280
If you say so.

116
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Let's both pay the money!

117
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Oops, so sorry.

118
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
They have found the poison of the Nenggong bridge.

119
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,440
But we don't know where he is from.

120
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,440
However, the secret passage in the underground river

121
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,440
should be the one that was set up by the imperial family.

122
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,440
After we found out the location,

123
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,440
only the Tibetan Sea entered the imperial family.

124
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,440
I am so curious.

125
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Such a real name.

126
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Jin Si.

127
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Only the Tibetan Sea.

128
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Who else?

129
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
I am going to kill him now.

130
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Kill him.

131
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Kill him for the morning.

132
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Now, the most important thing is to kill him.

133
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I must find him.

134
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Uncle.

135
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
I can't kill him.

136
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Uncle.

137
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Uncle.

138
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Uncle.

139
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Hurry up.

140
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,440
The Nenggong Bridge

141
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
The Nenggong Bridge

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Be careful.

143
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
We haven't been out for a long time.

144
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,440
We should go ahead.

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Let's go there.

146
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,440
I have lost all the information.

147
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,440
But the Eastern Xia palace has no reaction.

148
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,440
The Eastern Xia palace is so deep.

149
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
My daughter is gone.

150
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
She is so angry.

151
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
I am so sorry.

152
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
I am sorry.

153
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I am sorry.

154
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
I am sorry.

155
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
I am sorry.

156
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
I am sorry.

157
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
I am sorry.

158
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
She is so angry.

159
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I am afraid she will break our plan.

160
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
She won't come to help us.

161
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
If she doesn't come, there is only one way.

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
We should go there.

163
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Good.

164
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Hurry up.

165
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Be careful.

166
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
We are going to be late.

167
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
We are on the stage.

168
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Let's eat.

169
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Let's eat.

170
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Master, Xiaowen.

171
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Okay.

172
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Don't worry.

173
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I have already served the soup to Master Liu.

174
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
And the lady Xiong is coming.

175
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
We have been through this year.

176
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,440
Last year was a good year.

177
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I hope this year is better.

178
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Let's drink.

179
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Come.

180
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Guan Feng.

181
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I will go to Qingtian with Shilei.

182
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
I will learn some skills with Master Shi.

183
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
I am not going.

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
I am here.

185
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
I have a lot of food.

186
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Guan Feng is not going.

187
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I am not going either.

188
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Besides, I have already learned

189
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
how to teach Master Ma.

190
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
What did you count?

191
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I will count.

192
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I will definitely be good this year.

193
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
And I will have a group of thousand miles.

194
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
I can go to a very far place.

195
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
You.

196
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
You just want to let Hai send you a horse.

197
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
You just say it.

198
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Say so much.

199
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Eat.

200
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Master.

201
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I wish you a long life.

202
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Good luck.

203
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Okay.

204
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Okay.

205
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Come on.

206
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Eat.

207
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Eat more.

208
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Eat more.

209
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Eat more.

210
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Master.

211
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
In a few days,

212
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
let Miss Xiang off.

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
You can go now.

214
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
You have already decided.

215
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
You are not going to the East Xia anymore.

216
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Since the East Xia queen is not here,

217
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
I will have to go there.

218
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
What about her?

219
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Why do you force yourself like this?

220
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Do you think love is as simple as being in a relationship?

221
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
When love and hatred are together,

222
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
no matter how you plan to make a decision,

223
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,440
it may be hard to make a right decision.

224
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
But Xiao Hai,

225
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
I have already decided.

226
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
I will not let you go.

227
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
But Xiao Hai,

228
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,440
if someone makes a mistake,

229
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,440
you will never see him again.

230
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Life should not be like this.

231
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I don't want you to have regrets.

232
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
You are awake.

233
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Try it while it's hot.

234
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
What she made,

235
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
is it still going to the East Xia?

236
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,440
I can't persuade her to go there.

237
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
But I know

238
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,440
her heart is not as hard as before.

239
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Drink while it's hot.

240
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
I will not let you go.

241
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Xiao Hai,

242
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,440
try the An Shen tea I made for you.

243
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
It's good that you came.

244
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Help me send this to the Inner Council.

245
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
What is this?

246
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
This is my resignation letter.

247
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Resignation letter?

248
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Don't be so nervous.

249
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
I have already made up my mind.

250
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Sir, sir, sir.

251
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
What are you so anxious about?

252
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,440
The imperial court is in a hurry to report it.

253
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Yes, sir.

254
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Sir, you can leave.

255
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Zang Hai, you are finally here.

256
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Sir, what is the matter?

257
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
A few days ago,

258
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
the East Xia City was reported

259
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
that a new one has been released.

260
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
The treasure is about to be handed over

261
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
to the Emperor

262
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
with the new and advanced skills.

263
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
The Ministry of Justice

264
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
will quickly repair

265
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
the headquarters of the East Xia City.

266
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
The East Xia people are coming?

267
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
That's right.

268
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,440
This time, there is still the East Xia Queen.

269
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
The old people are all from the East Xia City.

270
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
I didn't expect that this time

271
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
she came personally.

272
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
The Emperor ordered us to be careful.

273
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Then the board of directors

274
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
will repair it with the help of the Princess of the East Xia?

275
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
No need.

276
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
The Queen of the East Xia said

277
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
she would live in the palace.

278
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm afraid she loves the new one.

279
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
That's good.

280
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,440
But she has saved a lot for us.

281
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
You should get ready.

282
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
She is still here.

283
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
The King of the East Xia

284
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
The King of the East Xia

285
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
The King of the East Xia

286
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
The King of the East Xia

287
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
The King of the East Xia

288
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
The King of the East Xia

289
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
The King of the East Xia

290
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
The King of the East Xia

291
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
The King of the East Xia

292
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
The King of the East Xia

293
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
The King of the East Xia

294
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
The King of the East Xia

295
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
The King of the East Xia

296
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
The King of the East Xia

297
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Cut the fall

298
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Cut the fall

299
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Cut the fall

300
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Cut the fall

301
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Cut the fall

302
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,440
Cut from fall

303
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,260
Xiang

St Việt

320
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:42,340
I'll accept

321
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,360
You have

Then

325
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,200
I will

326
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,880

I haven't seen him in a while.

329
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Your Majesty,

330
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,240
the Palace said that the princess was a little cold

331
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
and she was not going out for a walk.

332
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
She was afraid that she would be in trouble.

333
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,240
She will bring the princess with her health in a few days

334
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
and then come to your Majesty to greet her.

335
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
Take someone to deliver some good medicine.

336
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Yes.

337
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Thank you for your concern.

338
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
It's just a minor illness.

339
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
It will be better in a few days.

340
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
I brought some winter specialties for you.

341
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Please come in.

342
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Winter specialties.

343
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
Thank you.

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240

The Meijiu is 150 taels.

These are the treasures of the Qing Dynasty.

354
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Your Majesty, you are so wise.

355
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

356
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
The treasure I said is really valuable.

357
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
It's out of the store now.

358
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Then you can have it.

359
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
The treasure I said is really valuable.

360
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

361
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
The silver and silver are not worthy of the title.

362
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

363
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

364
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

365
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

366
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

367
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

368
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

369
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

370
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

371
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

372
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

373
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

374
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

375
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

376
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
The gold and silver are not worthy of the title.

377
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Dong Xia can't help but be himself.

378
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
I heard your majesty has a fondness for wood.

379
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
I ordered the best of Dong Xia

380
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
to build this wood palace.

381
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
The world is so unique.

382
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
The treasure is in it.

383
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,400
If you open it, let me see.

384
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,600
Please allow me to sell a coffin.

385
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,360
The tomb is hidden.

386
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,600
The tomb is even more so.

387
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,640
If the general can open the tomb,

388
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,960
I will share it with you.

389
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,000
If no one can open it,

390
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,720
His Majesty will allow me to be the first to be named

391
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,040
in the world.

392
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,240
I will open it for His Majesty.

393
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,880
This is considered an idea.

394
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,480
I could be any host.

395
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,360
You are so jokey.

396
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,960
Here he is.

397
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,720

398
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,760

Xuan Wu

436
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,360
Four creatures are in the east, south, west, north, and four directions

437
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
And the same pattern as the one in the Mo Palace

438
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,360
Could it be that

439
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,360
Lu Shi and Tong Tu are in the same pattern?

440
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
What is this pattern?

441
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Wu Ju and Zhong Gong are in the same pattern

442
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,360
The first one is the third one is the sixth one

443
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,860
The second one is the sixth one

444
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,360
The sixth one is the eighth one

445
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,860
The way to solve the Mo Palace is in the seventh one

446
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,860
The second one is the seventh one, Tong Dao

447
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,360
The fifth one is the southern one

448
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
This is Zhu Que

449
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
It's frozen

450
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,860
The third one is the pavilion

451
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
The fourth one is the east

452
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,860
This is Qing Long

453
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,860
The sixth one is the water

454
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,360
This is Xuan Wu

455
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
The fourth one is the oil

456
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,860
This is the crystal

457
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,360
This is Bai Hu

458
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Do you prepare yourself for the next eternity A Shaman esquerdo?

459
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Do you prepare yourself for the next eternity eggs?

460
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
I told you

461
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
The Chili Powder ofан Nian Lao

462
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,300
The leavesd Match both by the MAI

463
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:39,860
What's the dad

464
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,620
But there are a thousand changes when combined.

465
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,260
This is my father's way.

466
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,300
How would he know my father's memories?

467
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,260
He is testing it.

468
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,300
It's not hard to remove it.

469
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,900
But once it's removed,

470
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,540
my identity will be exposed.

471
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,620
But if it's not dangerous.

472
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,120
Have you lost your mind,

473
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
Sir?

474
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:15,700
...

475
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,740
Your Majesty.

476
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,500
I took it.

477
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,420
Yes.

478
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,900
Good.

479
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,820
Well done.

480
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,940
Come on, you should see her.

481
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,020
It's two.

482
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,980
Give it up.

483
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,180
The gift.

484
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,660
Your Majesty, it's wise that the jade jade jade is from the mountain of Dancui.

485
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,860
It's a jade jade jade that is like the spirit of the heaven and earth.

486
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,260
The jade jade is like a baby that is asleep.

487
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,260
There's a legend in the east that the jade jade has a spirit.

488
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,260
Your Majesty, please allow the jade jade to be placed in the right place.

489
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,260
The treasure is a treasure that is made of everything.

490
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,660
You're thoughtful.

491
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,060
I'll hand over this matter to the Ministry of Rites.

492
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,860
Your Majesty.

493
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,060
Your Majesty, the tree leaves are made of special craftsmanship.

494
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,260
I think this Lord Zhang is very suitable.

495
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,660
That's right.

496
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,460
Since it's the jade jade that he made,

497
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,460
I'm sure that it's because of this jade jade.

498
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,460
I'll allow him to make the jade jade paper.

499
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,060
I'll also show you the jade jade jade that is made of the mountain of Jinxiu.

500
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

501
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,060
Your Majesty.

502
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,860
Your Majesty, that poor man's jade jade

503
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,860
is asking you to come over.

504
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,860
What's wrong with him?

505
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
I gave him a jade jade,

506
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,860
but he turned it upside down.

507
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
He even scolded me.

508
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,860
He said that I was a rotten grape.

509
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,860
I was in a bad mood.

510
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Why do you want to scold people?

511
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
Why do you want to scold the guards?

512
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,860
I'll leave if you scold me.

513
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
You've been keeping me locked up for so long.

514
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
You don't have to be angry with me.

515
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,860
Besides, if I didn't scold him, would you come?

516
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,860
I remember one thing.

517
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,860
You even owe me a favor.

518
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,860
As long as I say it,

519
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
you can't refuse.

520
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
You say it.

521
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,860
I want you to let me out.

522
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,860
Okay.

523
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
You can leave soon.

524
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
You really let me go?

525
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,860
What should I do?

526
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
You know Xiao Hai the best.

527
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
What do you think?

528
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
There's no solution.

529
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,860
There's no solution.

530
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,860
I think...

531
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,860
it's a way to make a living.

532
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,860
You didn't teach him a lesson.

533
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,860
How could he make a living?

534
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,860
Xiao Hai is right.

535
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
He's a little girl.

536
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,860
He's a good girl.

537
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,860
You can't do that.

538
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
Why do you have to say that?

539
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,860
I...

540
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,860
I only taught him how to lie.

541
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,860
I don't understand this.

542
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,860
There are still some real things in the world.

543
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,860
You can't just lie.

544
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,860
Your mother is here.

545
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,860
She came to the capital?

546
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,860
You saw her?

547
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,860
Your mother is indeed more powerful than the King of Peking.

548
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,860
She has already tried my identity.

549
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
Now that you've seen her,

550
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
you still won't give up?

551
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,860
I won't kill you.

552
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
You're not my enemy.

553
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Your mother is the one.

554
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
Your mother is the one.

555
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
I'm leaving.

556
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
Zang Hai!

557
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,860
Do you still remember

558
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,860
the stars in the middle of the night?

559
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,860
It turns out that it's true.

560
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,860
Your tears have flowed into my heart.

561
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,860
I've waited for so long.

562
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,860
I've waited for so long.

563
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,860
Finally, I've waited for my family.

564
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,860
I've waited for my mother who is still alive.

565
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,860
I've waited for so long.

566
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
But I've decided.

567
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,860
I won't see my mother again.

568
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,860
Take me away.

569
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
Let's forget about this.

570
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
Okay?

571
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,860
I'm sorry.

572
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,860
I'm sorry.

573
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,860
I'm sorry.

574
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,860
I'm sorry.

575
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,860
Wait, Mr. Zang.

576
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,860
Please do the same for me.

577
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,860
I'll tell him about the evidence.

578
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,860
The river flows like a flower.

579
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,860
No wonder people are so worried.

580
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,860
Your Highness has been here before.

581
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,860
What's the matter?

582
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,860
What's the matter?

583
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,860
Did you really come here for nine years?

584
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,860
I've been here for nine years.

585
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,860
I've been here for nine years.

586
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,860
I've been here for nine years.

587
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,860
I've been here for nine years.

588
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,860
I've been here for nine years.

589
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,860
I don't remember.

590
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,860
I know everything about my daughter and you.

591
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Is there anything happy about her?

592
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,860
At the moment, I can't think of anything.

593
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,860
She didn't say that in her letter.

594
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,860
She said that someone was smart and determined.

595
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,860
She knew nothing about it.

596
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,860
She was very close to her.

597
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:27,860
I think she still doesn't know what people are thinking.

598
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,860
I heard that the Great Yong had a great reader.

599
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,860
If he had to come to the Xiong Rong School,

600
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,860
why would he be so useless?

601
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,860
It's a pity that he died early.

602
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,860
Tell me.

603
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
Who are you?

604
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,860
I'm the Great Yong.

605
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Who are you?

606
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,860
Your father or your master?

607
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,860
It seems that it's all right.

608
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,860
He taught you well.

609
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,860
He knows why Kaidou died.

610
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,860
Because he didn't eat food.

611
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,860
If he didn't eat food, he would only die.

612
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,860
What is food?

613
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,860
What is food?

614
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,860
Now, take me to see my daughter.

615
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,860
Call me food.

616
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Don't lie to me.

617
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,860
I can see your eyes.

618
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,860
She is in your hands.

619
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,860
So, from your eyes,

620
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,860
you can see so many things.

621
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,860
I will take you to the Xiong Rong School.

622
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,860
It's a good idea.

623
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,860
I will go to the Xiong Rong School.

624
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,860
I will show you my daughter.

625
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Your Majesty.

626
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,860
The Great Yong people were all killed.

627
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,860
You are the only one left.

628
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,860
Don't force me to do anything.

629
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,860
I will do anything for you.

630
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,860
It's not good.

631
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,860
Okay.

632
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,860
I will take you there.

633
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,860
I will go to the Xiong Rong School.

634
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,860
