Episode 2

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,720
Zheng Den businesses

3
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,880
Young Master, sorry for the late arrival

4
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,260
what happened to you?

5
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,120
Young Master won't let you know if you come.

6
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,320
I know my mistake.

7
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,680
I told him not to make any noise

8
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,120
when you were busy.

9
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,400
You are...

10
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
It's not a serious matter.

11
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,040
It's nonsense.

12
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,920
Don't get involved.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,520
Here.

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,440
Take these to the study.

15
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,840
Young Master.

16
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm here today

17
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,040
to ask you out

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,320
for a drink and listen to the music.

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,800
You must be

20
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,320
relaxed even if you are tired.

21
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,760
Young Master, you don't know that

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm a very bad drinker.

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,880
I get drunk with a little wine.

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,680
When I'm drunk,

25
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,000
I like to talk nonsense.

26
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,600
I'll say whatever I shouldn't.

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,680
Let's listen to the music.

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
Don't drink the wine.

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,560
Okay.

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
Let's just listen to the music.

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,120
I promise you

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,080
I won't drink alcohol.

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,800
Let's go.

34
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,680
Let's go.

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,000
I...

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,400
I was talking nonsense.

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
You...

38
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,520
You talk too much.

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,560
No, don't talk nonsense.

40
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,560
I know.

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,600
Yes.

42
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,960
It's Chu Huai Ming.

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,320
My mom

44
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,040
made me cry.

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,960
Zhang Hai.

46
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,840
You are really good at drinking.

47
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,400
Master Zhang.

48
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,440
Master Zhang.

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,800
Why did you drink so much?

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,920
Help the master

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,840
to rest.

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,760
Master Zhang.

53
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,720
It's late.

54
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,320
I'll send the master back.

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay.

56
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,360
I'm tired, too.

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,440
I'll stay here.

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
You can

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,080
find a room for me later.

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,640
Yes, master.

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,080
Master Zhang.

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,480
Come on.

63
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:41,840
Where are you going?

64
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,360
Come back to my room.

65
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,760
Let's go.

66
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,360
Hurry up.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,640
Where are you going?

68
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,680
Back to the room.

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,440
I...

70
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,920
Be careful.

71
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,400
Come on.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
The End

73
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,240
Master Zhang is tired.

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,360
Take him to rest.

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,240
Yes.

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
The End

77
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,320
Godfather.

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,920
It seems to be

79
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,240
the structure of a box

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320
and the method of dismantling the mechanism.

81
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,680
And the one next to me

82
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,400
is the copper fish.

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
Yes.

84
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,120
Zhuang Rong Ying

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,200
told Zhang Hai

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,560
about the copper fish.

87
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,600
The copper fish

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,960
is related to the ghost.

89
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,480
This thing...

90
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,960
Did

91
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,160
Huixi Ye Xingzai

92
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,560
take it from Zhuang Rong Ying?

93
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,040
What is Godfather going to do?

94
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,400
This time,

95
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,160
we have to confirm it in person.

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,840
Xiao Hai.

97
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,760
Zhuang Zhi's Mansion asked someone to come to pass on the message.

98
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,600
Tomorrow at noon,

99
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,920
they'll invite you to the Zui Chun House.

100
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
The End

101
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,760
Brother Sanhai.

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,480
Let me tell you.

103
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,960
This is

104
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
the new Yang Gao plum wine

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
from Zui Chun House.

106
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,600
It's very good for your stomach.

107
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
You must try it.

108
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm happy today.

109
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,000
The two of us

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,720
must try our best.

111
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,240
Here.

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,240
Thank you, Young Master.

113
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,920
I'll try my best.

114
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,040
Here.

115
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,280
How is it?

116
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,400
Good wine.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
Since you like it,

118
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,600
let's drink more.

119
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,800
Here.

120
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,440
Please.

121
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,960
Okay.

122
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,360
Let's have another drink.

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,120
Young Master.

124
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,920
How about

125
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,280
we eat some dishes first?

126
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,200
Brother Sanhai.

127
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,320
If you want to

128
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,120
show off in front of the officials,

129
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,840
you must have

130
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,840
the ability to drink.

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
How about today?

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,240
I'll practice with you.

133
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,960
Here.

134
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,080
Zhang Han.

135
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
You're drunk.

136
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm not drunk.

137
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,000
Cr playoffs.

138
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
You know what night is next?

139
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,240
Are you afraid of having a roof fall

140
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,760
behind you?

141
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,680
What if

142
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
you get a closed nose or a knee injury?

143
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm afraid

144
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
your dad will be worried.

145
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,160
You know it.

146
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,880
He's смirking at him.

147
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,480
That's too bad.

148
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,160
The factUN was asking videos

149
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,600
is not a problem.

150
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,800
A blackout?

151
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
He's probably

152
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,800
Did you hot dog

153
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,320
your mother?

154
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,020
Do you want to

155
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,940
prove me wrong?

156
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,240
I'd like to know.

157
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,680
You want to

158
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,820
use such words?

159
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,560
Why don't you dare to wissen?

160
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Why don't you dare to?

161
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,140
Listen!

162
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,840
My lord is angry at me now.

163
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,640
I'm more capable

164
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,860
than all of you.

165
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,900
Come on.

166
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,360
I don't think so

167
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,440
Bro

168
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,040
I admit

169
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,680
I was a little distant fromettuangzhen

170
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,400
and advised you before

171
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
But people should look ahead

172
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
I want to spend some time with you

173
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm as transportation

174
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,920
as my father

175
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,400
Next time we will be even better

176
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,200
I really hope that you can treat me as a friend who knows nothing and is not strict.

177
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,400
I know nothing and am not strict.

178
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,800
You treat me as a friend.

179
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm happy.

180
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm happy.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,400
Then, Mr. Zeng, tell me.

182
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,200
Did you find what my father wanted?

183
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Ghost blood?

184
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,400
You mean ghost blood?

185
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,800
Father, the Marquis did tell me that

186
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
he wanted to find ghost blood.

187
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:53,200
He said that he would do anything as long as he had ghost blood.

188
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm not sure.

189
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't faint.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,600
Where did you find it?

191
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
I...

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
No.

193
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,000
Let go.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Come here.

195
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,200
Slowly.

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What are you doing?

197
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,600
You can't say it.

198
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Marquis said that I shouldn't say it to anyone.

199
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,800
I'm not an outsider.

200
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,400
I swear that I won't tell anyone.

201
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay?

202
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,200
But...

203
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,400
I didn't tell you about my father.

204
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
What do you mean by that?

205
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,600
I...

206
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,400
Nonsense.

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Come here.

208
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Come here.

209
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Did she ask you to step in?

210
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
It is a secret.

211
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
You have to tell me.

212
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,320
He is

213
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,000
Zeng Yuoguang from In없이 fighter brigade.

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,400
Tell me now.

215
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes, your uncle.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Nonsense.

217
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,400
Eunuch

218
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,680
Eunuch

219
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Eunuch heard it

220
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,720
I asked him

221
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Eunuch

222
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,600
He said

223
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,800
the Marquis got the ghost seal

224
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,080
and hid it under the treasury of the Marquis's mansion

225
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,480
You never knew about it

226
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,920
Marquis Pingjing never told you about it

227
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,120
I never heard my father mention it

228
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,960
Master

229
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,800
you should know

230
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,520
what he said

231
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,880
is your father's biggest secret

232
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,480
Your father

233
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,080
told him all the secrets

234
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,360
It means

235
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,920
he is your real happiness

236
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,880
But now he chose to help your brother

237
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,840
What does it mean?

238
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,000
As long as he is here

239
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,480
the Zhuang family is Zhuang Zhixing's

240
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,400
Impossible

241
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm the enemy

242
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,280
My mother is my father's wife

243
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,640
Your mother, Jiang Xiang, was favored

244
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,240
but she is no longer the same

245
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,120
How much can she help you?

246
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,680
Jiang Xiang

247
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Jiang Xiang killed Shen Shi

248
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

249
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,240
I'm not talking nonsense

250
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,480
The whole family is involved

251
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,120
I'm hungry

252
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm full of blood

253
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,080
No, no, no

254
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,080
Master, how about this?

255
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,280
Zang Hai can help your brother

256
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,920
I can help you

257
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,520
As long as you kill Zang Hai

258
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,920
we will protect you from the consequences

259
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,080
What do you think?

260
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,800
As long as you kill him

261
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
Zhuang Zhixing will be punished

262
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,640
He can't do anything alone

263
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,080
The position of the family

264
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,880
will be yours

265
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,720
What are you waiting for?

266
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,120
Young Master

267
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,760
Young Master

268
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Why?

269
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,360
Why?

270
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,240
Young Master

271
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,040
Good boy

272
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,440
We will do our best in the future

273
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,320
Hold on

274
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,700
I won't stop

275
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,180
Don't move

276
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,480
Hold on

277
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,000
Let's go.

278
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,840
по

279
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,920
holy father

280
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
I'm sorry

281
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
Uncle

282
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Zang Hai was rescued

283
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Did you see who it was?

284
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
It was his housekeeper

285
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Zang Hai didn't die

286
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm afraid it's not easy to do this

287
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Uncle, what do you mean?

288
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Mr. Zhang, you're not only a corrupt official

289
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,920
but also a court official

290
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
I didn't

291
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Guards

292
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
What are you doing?

293
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Since you don't admit it

294
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
when you get to the Department of the Imperial Guards

295
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,920
the position will be checked

296
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Come with us

297
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
I've done everything you told me to do

298
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Shut up

299
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Shut up

300
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Shui Lei, get a car

301
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Master went to watch Cao Jingxiang as planned

302
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Let's go back and stop the bleeding

303
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
No, I can't

304
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
You can't hold on for long

305
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
You'll die if you bleed too much

306
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
The plan can't be changed

307
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Send me to the House of Marquis

308
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Are you crazy? You'll die if you do this

309
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Trust me

310
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
I know

311
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Send me to the House of Marquis

312
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Shui Lei, go to the House of Marquis

313
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Yes

314
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Marquis

315
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
What's wrong? Why are you so flustered?

316
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Something happened

317
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Why are you bleeding?

318
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
It's not my blood

319
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
It's Lord Zang's blood

320
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
He's badly injured

321
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Zang Hai

322
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Why are you still standing there?

323
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Call the doctor

324
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Yes

325
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
What's going on?

326
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Marquis

327
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,920
I can't hold on

328
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
When I have something to do

329
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
I must tell you

330
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,920
You killed my nephew

331
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Who?

332
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
It's...

333
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
It's Young Master

334
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
My master wants to kill you

335
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Young Master invited me to dinner

336
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,920
The West Sword suddenly fell into my hands

337
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Then

338
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Then Cao Jinxian came out

339
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Cao Jinxian

340
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
What's wrong with him?

341
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
I have to tell Cao Jinxian

342
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
before I kill him

343
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
He's in danger

344
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Cao Jinxian

345
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Hurry up

346
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Go to save him

347
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Zang Hai

348
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Zang Hai

349
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
You can't die now

350
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Hold on

351
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Zang Hai

352
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Zang Hai

353
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Where's the doctor?

354
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Zang Hai

355
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Zang Hai

356
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Zang Hai

357
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Zang Hai

358
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Zang Hai

359
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Zang Hai

360
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Zang Hai

361
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Zang Hai

362
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Zang Hai

363
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Zang Hai

364
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Zang Hai

365
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Zang Hai

366
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Zang Hai

367
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Zang Hai

368
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Zang Hai

369
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Zang Hai

370
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Zang Hai

371
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Zang Hai

372
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Zang Hai

373
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Zang Hai

374
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Zang Hai

375
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Zang Hai

376
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Zang Hai

377
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Zang Hai

378
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Zang Hai

379
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Zang Hai

380
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Zang Hai

381
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Zang Hai

382
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Zang Hai

383
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
Master

384
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Come on

385
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Master

386
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Du Wei Si

387
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
still refuses to let them go

388
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Zhuang Shan

389
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Get two men for me

390
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,320
The imperial envoy of the Imperial Guards, Xu Daishan,

391
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,720
and the imperial envoy of the capital, Qi Ming.

392
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Yes.

393
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,560
Xu Daishan, Qi Ming?

394
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,360
He has been coming to the marquis's residence often these days.

395
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,360
He has been very close with Marquis Pingjing.

396
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Godfather, a few days later will be Marquis Pingjing's birthday.

397
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,560
I heard that he will be a guest of honor.

398
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,560
And this time, he invited many officials who are not compatible with you.

399
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,360
It seems that he is not thinking about the past.

400
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Once he gets the Guixi, he will start to attack me.

401
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Master.

402
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Master.

403
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Master.

404
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,160
Good boy, you are finally awake.

405
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,160
After you got to the marquis's residence, Marquis Pingjing sent you back to the manor.

406
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,160
You slept for several days.

407
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360
Slowly.

408
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Here, little boy.

409
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
Slowly, slowly.

410
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Master, how is the marquis's residence now?

411
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,960
On the day of the installation, Cao Jingxian had it taken away.

412
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,560
He never came back.

413
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Marquis Pingjing has invited all the officials who are close to him to his residence.

414
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,160
It seems that he is going to pull the strings and try to impeach Cao Jingxian.

415
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,760
He believed me.

416
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,160
Your trick of being a coward is really making Marquis Pingjing very wary.

417
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,360
Only by doing this, no matter what I say, Marquis Pingjing will believe me.

418
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,160
I think Cao Jingxian already knows that

419
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,560
Marquis Pingjing is going to cause him trouble.

420
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Green hills and golden valley

421
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,960
When will the sun rise

422
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:19,160
How many people are in Duansong

423
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:28,760
The water is so clear

424
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:39,560
The wind blows in the forest

425
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:51,560
The moon is so clear

426
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Cao Jingxian knew that the ghost blood from my mouth was in the back of the mansion's warehouse.

427
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,560
With his character, he will definitely start first.

428
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,960
If I were Cao Jingxian, I would have to find the ghost blood while I was trying to deal with Marquis Pingjing.

429
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,760
I would definitely need someone else's help.

430
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,160
And this person must be someone who knows about the situation in the past.

431
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,160
It's very likely that he is my third enemy.

432
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Shilei and I will keep an eye on the Cao mansion.

433
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,360
Once Cao Jingxian makes any movement, I will immediately tell you.

434
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Are you hungry? I have already prepared something for you. I will go get it.

435
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Xiao'ai, Xiao'ai.

436
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Cao Jingxian finally went out. I told Shilei to follow him.

437
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,560
He was forced by Marquis Pingjing. I will go with him.

438
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
You are so well-informed.

439
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
I can't care about that much.

440
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Xiao'ai.

441
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
You, you, you.

442
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
You, you, you.

443
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
You, you, you.

444
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
You, you, you.

445
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
You, you, you.

446
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
You, you, you.

447
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
You, you.

448
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
You, you, you.

449
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Go.

450
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Detective Lil, Be quiet!

451
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Be quiet!

452
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,960
kı

453
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,560
Do not knock!

454
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
My Lord,

455
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,840
live here?

456
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,880
It's hard to say.

457
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,200
We'll know when we get in.

458
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,800
But...

459
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,000
But there are so many

460
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,480
rooms outside the Palace of Zhi.

461
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,000
How can we get in?

462
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
The Palace of Zhi

463
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,800
What...

464
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,280
What are you doing?

465
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,320
If you can't walk on the ground,

466
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,240
just walk in the water.

467
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,680
I know the distribution of the capital.

468
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,280
I can find the way to the underground water of the Palace of Zhi.

469
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,240
But...

470
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,840
Chi Lei.

471
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,760
Wait for me here.

472
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
The Palace of Zhi

473
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,400
Your Highness.

474
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,120
What's the purpose of your visit today?

475
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,040
Everyone knows the danger.

476
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,400
I can tell you everything.

477
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,080
But...

478
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,640
You must keep your promise.

479
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,520
Eunuch Cao came to me

480
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,440
before he got the ghost seal.

481
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,520
I'm sure he's hiding

482
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,280
somewhere that makes you feel anxious.

483
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,320
You're really smart.

484
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,120
To be honest,

485
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,040
I'm not sure about it.

486
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,600
But I'm still willing to

487
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
tell you the truth.

488
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,520
Let's talk about the way to the Cloud.

489
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,280
Okay.

490
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,680
Everything is as we agreed.

491
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Your Highness.

492
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,040
Tell me.

493
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,360
How should we use

494
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,080
the ghost seal?

495
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,280
You'll know it

496
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,880
when it's done.

497
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Are you sure?

498
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,960
The ghost seal

499
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,760
is in the hands of Marquis Pingjing.

500
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,960
It's right under the treasury

501
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,640
of Marquis Pingjing's mansion.

502
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,480
It's a big deal.

503
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,480
The ghost seal

504
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,320
will be on the night of the next day.

505
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,760
We'll have a special guest.

506
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,680
When we work together,

507
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,240
we'll have a special guest.

508
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,160
Aren't you afraid that I'll take the ghost seal

509
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,120
and disappear?

510
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,000
You're kidding.

511
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,440
You're the son of the Eastern Xia.

512
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,000
What does it mean

513
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,480
to you?

514
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,120
I'm afraid

515
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,240
you know it better than I do.

516
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,600
Since we took the initiative

517
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,280
to find you,

518
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,960
we've found the ghost seal.

519
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,280
As long as we get the ghost seal,

520
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,080
everything will be fine.

521
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
We've been looking for

522
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,800
the ghost seal for a long time.

523
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,280
We can't wait any longer.

524
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,080
I'm leaving.

525
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,560
My lord,

526
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,160
are you all right?

527
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,840
You mean the third person

528
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,520
is the son of the Eastern Xia?

529
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,520
It's said that the son of the Eastern Xia

530
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,160
hasn't been out of the State of Chu for ten years.

531
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,360
No one has seen him

532
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,240
since he came to the capital.

533
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,760
When he came to the capital,

534
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,160
he was the first person

535
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,400
to die in your family.

536
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,200
But the son of the Eastern Xia is only ten years old.

537
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,760
There's a story in the history book

538
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,960
that the young people

539
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,440
were shown more valuable

540
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,080
than the adults.

541
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,640
And I heard

542
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,160
their conversation very clearly.

543
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,880
That's right.

544
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,680
The ghost seal is the treasure of the Eastern Xia.

545
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,880
Your father took it away from the Eastern Xia.

546
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,240
He has no reason not to find it.

547
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,280
Here.

548
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,840
Since Cao Jinxian has decided to kill him,

549
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,400
the son of the Eastern Xia

550
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,360
will not stand aside.

551
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,120
He won't let Cao Jinxian

552
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,520
take the ghost seal away alone.

553
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,920
So he will show up.

554
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,440
I'll stay there.

555
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,800
I'll wait for my enemy.

556
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,600
Three.

557
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,480
Two.

558
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,520
Three.

559
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,400
Three.

560
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,560
Two.

561
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,320
Three.

562
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,320
Two.

563
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,200
Five.

564
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,360
Four.

565
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,040
Six.

566
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,320
Five.

567
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,000
Seven.

568
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,960
Four.

569
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,840
Three.

570
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,840
Two.

571
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,520
Chief,

572
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,680
someone is looking for you.

573
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,400
You go on.

574
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,520
One.

575
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,400
Two.

576
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,480
Two.

577
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,280
Two.

578
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,840
Why are you here today?

579
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,920
I have something important

580
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,760
to tell you.

581
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,400
You'll build the tomb tomorrow.

582
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,440
Yes.

583
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,120
Tomorrow is Father's birthday.

584
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,120
I'll prepare a birthday gift.

585
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,280
What's wrong?

586
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,160
Marquis Mingwan

587
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,000
invited many close officials

588
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,400
to discuss the matter with Cao Jinxian.

589
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,480
Cao Jinxian

590
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,080
got the news in advance.

591
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,080
He will go.

592
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
What will happen?

593
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,080
With your father and Cao Jinxian's temper,

594
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,440
I'm afraid there will be a fierce battle.

595
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,160
What do you want me to do?

596
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,720
Let me ask you.

597
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,560
How are you

598
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,920
getting along with your brothers?

599
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,440
If I ask you to go back to the Marquis Mansion

600
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,040
to save your father tomorrow night,

601
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,800
will they help you?

602
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,800
Now they all listen to me.

603
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,480
There should be no problem.

604
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,520
OK.

605
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,760
Then I'll let you

606
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,920
take your brothers back to the Marquis Mansion

607
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,240
tomorrow night.

608
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,280
Only at the most critical moment,

609
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,120
your father will remember your kindness.

610
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,080
It's a thousand times better

611
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,560
than any birthday gift you give.

612
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
I asked you to save him.

613
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,720
Not for the sake of your father and son,

614
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,760
but for yourself.

615
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,560
Now the House of Zhuang is in danger.

616
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,920
This is a great opportunity for you.

617
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,320
When is the night?

618
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,720
Wait for my news.

619
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,420
Come on.

620
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,960
Wait here.

621
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,300
OK.

622
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Miss Xiang, you're really good at martial arts.

623
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Why are you here?

624
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,880
I just wanted to walk around.

625
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,880
I didn't realize that I'd come to the pillow house.

626
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,640
What a coincidence.

627
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,880
You didn't come to see me,

628
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,400
so I was about to come to you.

629
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
Miss Xiang,

630
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,280
you're here to see me?

631
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,640
I'm here to see you.

632
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
I'm here to see you.

633
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
I'm here to see you.

634
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
I'm here to see you.

635
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
I'm here to see you.

636
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
I'm here to see you.

637
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
I'm here to see you.

638
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,520
I'm here to see you.

639
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Miss Xiang,

640
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,040
do you have anything to tell me?

641
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,640
Last time you asked me about it,

642
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,840
I told you to exchange it with a secret.

643
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,120
But I've changed my mind now.

644
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,560
I can tell you everything.

645
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,200
You don't have to say anything.

646
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Aren't you curious?

647
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,240
Friends shouldn't be hidden from each other.

648
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,360
Tomorrow night at 8 p.m.,

649
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
wait for me at Qing Que Bridge in the city.

650
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Tomorrow night?

651
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Miss Xiang,

652
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,240
I'm here right now.

653
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,560
Can't I say it now?

654
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,200
It's not convenient today.

655
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,720
I'll tell you everything

656
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,160
after I see you tomorrow night.

657
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But...

658
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,280
But tomorrow night is the birthday banquet of the Marquis.

659
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,000
What's wrong with Pingjing Marquis?

660
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,880
He'll celebrate next year.

661
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,400
Do you want to make some

662
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,200
friends who have power and power

663
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,840
at the banquet?

664
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,160
I've reminded you before.

665
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,440
In the capital,

666
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,800
I hate officials the most.

667
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,840
Miss Xiang,

668
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,120
you misunderstood me.

669
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,960
The Marquis helped me

670
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,000
in the court.

671
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,960
He's been kind to me.

672
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,320
So I can't

673
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,360
miss his birthday banquet.

674
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
You're so stubborn.

675
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,480
I've promised to tell you all the secrets.

676
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,480
You still don't understand.

677
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,800
The Marquis is kind to you.

678
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,360
Do I help you less?

679
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,680
Since you're willing to tell me,

680
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,960
you'll really treat me as a friend.

681
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
How about this?

682
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Wait for me for a while tomorrow night.

683
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,560
We'll talk later.

684
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,760
Don't even think about it.

685
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,600
If you don't come tomorrow night,

686
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,640
you'll never know the secret.

687
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,160
Okay.

688
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
I promise you.

689
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
See you tomorrow night.

690
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,840
Miss,

691
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,440
are you really going to tell Lord Zang?

692
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,680
There's nothing to hide

693
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,960
from him now.

694
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,240
You have to

695
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,600
make a promise for me first.

696
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,080
There will be a bad battle

697
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
at the Marquis' mansion tomorrow night.

698
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,280
I want him to be safe

699
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,440
in the palace.

700
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,240
You stay by his side.

701
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,720
You have to hold him back no matter what.

702
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,480
No.

703
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,480
I want to protect Miss.

704
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,440
I'll go to him

705
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,680
after the matter is over.

706
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,160
Tonight,

707
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,280
there will be a bad battle.

708
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,640
You're all my relatives.

709
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,400
I've raised you for so long.

710
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,360
It's time to return the favor.

711
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Yes, Lord Zang.

712
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,360
Lu Ye.

713
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,280
The son of the East Xia will come.

714
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,040
Keep an eye on him.

715
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,680
Yes.

716
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,240
Chi Lei.

717
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,880
Remember what I said?

718
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,240
Guan Feng.

719
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,240
Don't be careless with what I told you.

720
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,800
Master, I'm going.

721
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,720
Be careful.

722
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,720
We'll follow the plan.

723
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,440
Guan Feng.

724
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,520
Tell him when you see him

725
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,120
that I was drunk by the Marquis.

726
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,680
Tell him not to wait for me.

727
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,000
Don't worry.

728
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,480
Go.
