00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We are the people of the world.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We are the people of the world.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We are the people of the world.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We are the people of the world.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We are the people of the world.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We are the people of the world.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We are the people of the world.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We are the people of the world.

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We are the people of the world.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We are the people of the world.

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We are the people of the world.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We are the people of the world.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We are the people of the world.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We are the people of the world.

15
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We are the people of the world.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We are the people of the world.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We are the people of the world.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We are the people of the world.

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We are the people of the world.

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We are the people of the world.

21
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,000
Ear차助理

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
再罢了

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,800
反手

24
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,000
The세요客

25
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,640
What is he doing?

26
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
The two of them are inside.

27
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,640
The machine that opened the tunnel is over there.

28
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Please.

29
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
The machine that opened the tunnel is over there.

30
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Find another way.

31
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
The machine that opened the tunnel is over there.

32
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
The machine that opened the tunnel is over there.

33
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Come on, eat.

34
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Where is Zhang Hai?

35
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
He can't come.

36
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
He went to my mother?

37
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
He went to kill my mother, right?

38
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Don't ask me so much.

39
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
It's good.

40
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Let me and my mother,

41
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
he and his children,

42
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
die today.

43
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
What do you mean?

44
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
You are a doctor.

45
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Can't you see that I'm pregnant?

46
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
No.

47
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
No way.

48
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
How could Xiao'ai...

49
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
If you don't believe me,

50
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
just sell it.

51
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
It's not enough to sell it.

52
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
It's not too small.

53
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
You are lying to me.

54
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
What's wrong with you?

55
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
How could I be so strong?

56
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,640
You put the money in the soup, right?

57
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,640
It's a pity that I've been poured out of the soup.

58
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
I'm not feeling well.

59
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Tell me where Zhang Hai is.

60
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
You are a liar.

61
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
I'm telling you,

62
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
the people in our family

63
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
can only talk if you want to.

64
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Even if you kill me,

65
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
I won't say it.

66
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Be careful.

67
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
What should we do?

68
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
They are coming.

69
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
They can't get in.

70
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Go ahead.

71
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Why is there no reaction?

72
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Be careful, Su Yan.

73
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Protect His Majesty.

74
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Take him back.

75
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Go.

76
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Go.

77
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
An Tu.

78
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Where are you going?

79
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Let him go.

80
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
Only three of us

81
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
can beat you.

82
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Besides,

83
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
how would he know where Xiao Hai will take your mother?

84
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Where is he?

85
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,640
He is taking your mother to Yulan Capital.

86
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
How many people did he take?

87
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
He is the only one to see your mother.

88
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
In case

89
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Gao Ming and Shilei

90
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
will take him secretly.

91
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
He is so insolent.

92
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
The Eastern Xia women

93
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
can't defeat the three of them.

94
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Don't underestimate them.

95
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Listen.

96
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
You all think that

97
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Zang Hai is in the dark.

98
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
My mother is here.

99
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
But my mother

100
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
knew her identity long ago.

101
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
She was prepared to come.

102
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Her plan is useless.

103
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
No way.

104
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
I don't believe you.

105
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Tell me where she is.

106
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
I have to stop her.

107
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
But the revenge is her.

108
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
We can't stop her.

109
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Including you.

110
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
I'm afraid

111
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
there will be

112
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
a reason for it.

113
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Sister.

114
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Please tell me.

115
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
But even if you go,

116
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
you will be helpless.

117
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Your Majesty.

118
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
We have already come out.

119
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
We will be gone soon.

120
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
He just doesn't want us to go in.

121
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Your Majesty.

122
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
The first one is on the path.

123
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
It's six years old.

124
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
And we have six people.

125
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
The second one is a traitor.

126
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
There are five people in the camp.

127
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
You stay and wait for me.

128
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
The others will follow me.

129
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Your Majesty.

130
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Let's go.

131
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
There are only four now.

132
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
The whole tunnel should be closed.

133
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
If the people who come in

134
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
exceed the number of people in the camp,

135
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
the front door will never open.

136
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Zang Hai is going to take us away.

137
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
It seems he wants to see me alone.

138
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
You all go back.

139
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Your Majesty.

140
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
The smoke just now is not poisonous.

141
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
I don't think he wants to harm anyone.

142
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Your Majesty.

143
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Your Majesty.

144
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
You don't have to say anything.

145
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I will go in alone.

146
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Yes.

147
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Your Majesty.

148
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Your Majesty.

149
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Your Majesty.

150
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,640
The door here has been closed.

151
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
It will never open.

152
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,640
It seems my daughter is not here.

153
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,640
She is in a safe place.

154
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Whose gift is this?

155
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,640
The daughter of the emperor of the former dynasty.

156
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
The daughter of the emperor of the former dynasty.

157
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Yiong Ning's gift.

158
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
The env Tensor 검us loves it

159
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,640
but Yiong Ning's return is dead in the mausoleum.

160
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,640
So she doesn't finish the gift.

161
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Then she lose her life.

162
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
I know Yiong Ning's story.

163
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,700
SheOLS

164
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,640
1 girl with Ke Han.

165
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Her life is full of happiness.

166
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,640
But much has failed.

167
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
The Chihu Zhu caused a serious change.

168
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
He killed her.

169
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Princess Yongning and her children

170
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,640
couldn't live.

171
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
They were tied to the wood.

172
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
They burned to death.

173
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
At that time,

174
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
the Chihu Zhu's army

175
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
couldn't be destroyed.

176
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Five years later,

177
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
the Chihu Zhu

178
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
was killed by 300,000 soldiers.

179
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
They were killed by the whole Mobei.

180
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
The Chihu Zhu

181
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
was killed by the whole Mobei.

182
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
All the words

183
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,640
were written by the Emperor of the Chihu Zhu.

184
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
He told himself

185
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
not to forget

186
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
the grudge between the three of us.

187
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
You brought me here

188
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
not just to tell the story of Princess Yongning.

189
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
That night,

190
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
when the whole family was killed,

191
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
you saw the fierce fire

192
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
in my heart.

193
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
You also had a daughter.

194
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
If she was the one who died,

195
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
what would you do?

196
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Of course, I would revenge for her.

197
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
But don't forget,

198
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
if you killed me,

199
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
you and my daughter would be no longer possible.

200
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
You used the poison to kill yourself.

201
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Then you made the wrong calculation.

202
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
I'm not the kind of person you think I am.

203
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Really?

204
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Then why did you

205
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
try to do the same thing again?

206
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
You must have forgotten

207
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
the grudge between you and me.

208
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
As long as you are alive,

209
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
the grudge will be gone.

210
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
So you kept on doing the same thing.

211
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
You let the grudge continue to be the one who killed yourself.

212
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
You wanted to stop your life

213
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
from being destroyed.

214
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
But time won't stop.

215
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
It will force you to keep moving forward.

216
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
You will meet someone

217
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
who makes you feel

218
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
that except for hatred,

219
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
there are some other things in life.

220
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
But you are more painful.

221
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Because you feel that

222
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
the grudge is slowly falling.

223
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
So you forced yourself

224
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
to give up on this.

225
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
You chose to keep on doing the revenge.

226
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Are you going to use this

227
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
to kill me?

228
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Look at your attitude.

229
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
What are those?

230
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
The grudge they have

231
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
I just need to use my power

232
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
to pull it out.

233
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
The grudge inside

234
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
will be removed in person.

235
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
It is not easy to use this sword

236
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
to kill you.

237
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
But if you use it

238
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,640
to light up the whole secret room,

239
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
it will be too easy.

240
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,640
I didn't expect that you would have such a hand.

241
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
You are indeed a child of the Kuaido.

242
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
You killed me.

243
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
You can't live on your own.

244
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Are you willing to die like this?

245
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
I am just talking about it.

246
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
It just proves that you are afraid of death.

247
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,640
The Eastern Xia and the Northern King

248
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
are not like that.

249
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Zang Hai.

250
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
You have a heart.

251
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
But your power is still out of the cage.

252
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Zai Long.

253
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Do you know what your decision

254
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
will bring to my daughter?

255
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
She will become the next one.

256
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
She will be tortured by the grudge.

257
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Even if you know that,

258
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
do you still want to do that?

259
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,640
I did kill you.

260
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,640
I did forgive An Tu.

261
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,640
But if I didn't kill you,

262
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
I would have been sorry to my dead family.

263
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
I must avenge this grudge.

264
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640
I will not forgive you.

265
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Mother.

266
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
An Tu.

267
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Mother.

268
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Go.

269
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,640
I will avenge you.

270
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Mother.

271
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
An Tu.

272
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Don't come over.

273
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Zang Hai.

274
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
I will die for my mother.

275
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
From now on,

276
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
we will be a family.

277
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
Okay?

278
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Mother.

279
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Promise me.

280
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Don't make things difficult for her.

281
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Stop.

282
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Mother.

283
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
You.

284
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
Take her away.

285
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
No.

286
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
You are a grudge against blood.

287
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
If you give up for me,

288
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
you will regret it.

289
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
We will both suffer.

290
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
This grudge

291
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
must be kept in secret.

292
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Silly girl.

293
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
You have been in the prison for ten years.

294
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
You are so old-fashioned.

295
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,640
You haven't been completely killed by hatred.

296
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
But you look like

297
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
a real enemy.

298
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
You and Zhuang Lu Yin and Cao Jing Xian

299
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
are the same family.

300
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Not you.

301
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Zhuang Lu Yin and Cao Jing Xian?

302
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
I ask you.

303
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Why do you think I am the same?

304
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,640
I don't know your relationship with Zhuang Lu Yin.

305
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
But you and Cao Jing Xian

306
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
are a long-time friends.

307
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
What is he?

308
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,640
If I really want to kill him,

309
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
do I still need help?

310
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,640
It's not strange that you think like that.

311
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Listen to me first.

312
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Are you going to believe me?

313
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Zhi Nuo.

314
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
You are so like him.

315
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
Go.

316
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Back then, the East Xia War was defeated.

317
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,640
The King heard a single whistle.

318
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
My throne was in danger.

319
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
That day, I was killed by the secret city.

320
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
I fell into the cliff.

321
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
I thought I was dead.

322
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,640
I woke up and was in a tent.

323
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
A big dragon saved me.

324
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
He is your father.

325
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Hurry up.

326
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
You are awake.

327
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Who are you?

328
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Where are you?

329
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
This is the Great Wall.

330
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
It's a huge wall.

331
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,640
This is the palace camp in Dan Sui Mountain.

332
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
I am the Great Wall.

333
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
The sky is clear and the sword is sharp.

334
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
I am here to repair the mountain stage.

335
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
Fortunately, the sword tribe didn't hurt you.

336
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,640
But at least it needs to rest for half a month.

337
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,640
When you are well, I will send you away.

338
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,640
You can't believe me?

339
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Of course I can't.

340
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
Why are you so stubborn?

341
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
You are going out.

342
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,640
It's cold now.

343
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
You can't walk for a long time.

344
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
You will freeze to death.

345
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
You should rest here.

346
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,640
There are no women in the camp.

347
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
And no gender discrimination.

348
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Sorry.

349
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Please excuse me.

350
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Here.

351
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
You need water.

352
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,640
You don't need to boil it.

353
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Do you have a wife?

354
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,640
I have a wife and a daughter.

355
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,640
I can take them to the east.

356
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I won't stay here.

357
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
They are waiting for me to go home.

358
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
You dare not look at the east.

359
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
What's good about the east?

360
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
The east is good.

361
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,640
But my home is in the east.

362
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Where have we end up in today's place?

363
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
We have 30itter lever horses.

364
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,840
That means

365
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,640
they have already загed in.

366
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Don't worry too much.

367
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Just go wherever you want.

368
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
People aren't like this anymore.

369
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
It's better to go apartmentrenaline

370
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,660
and detect some animals

371
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,340
from other parts of the country.

372
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,520
But you200 obsessiony акку sat LP.

373
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,560
Who shoud love share any VS for?

374
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
The structure on both sides of the east coast is called Bo Ruo.

375
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
You only know how to attack the generals.

376
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Let them defend more.

377
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Yes.

378
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,560
This is the Feng Shan Tai you built for the Emperor of the Great Yong.

379
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Yes.

380
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
The camp is not yellow, the mountain is not clear.

381
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
There are many hidden areas in the south.

382
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
It's hard to cross the four seas.

383
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,080
You great Yong people always want to

384
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,560
to make the world a better place.

385
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
They are all crazy.

386
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
They say everything is for the sake of the world.

387
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
But what can we bring

388
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
on the day we leave this world?

389
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Of course, it's not up to me.

390
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,560
But people should think about what they should leave behind.

391
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
The Qing Qiu dynasty is the Emperor.

392
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
It's also for the sake of the Great Yong.

393
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
You are thinking too much.

394
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
Why don't you be a commoner

395
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
and live for yourself?

396
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
People in the world

397
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
should live happily ever after.

398
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Life is what I want.

399
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,560
Life is what I want.

400
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
People can't get money.

401
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,560
They should live for themselves.

402
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
What is this?

403
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
It's a toy for my son.

404
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
It seems that

405
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
you really miss your family.

406
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
What is their name?

407
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
My son is called Zhinnu.

408
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
My daughter is called Yunnu.

409
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
What do you mean by that?

410
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
You great Yong people

411
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,560
just want your children to be a slave?

412
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,560
I just hope that they grow up slowly.

413
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
I have two daughters.

414
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
One is called Yin Zhu.

415
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
The other is called An Tu.

416
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Then,

417
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
what about them?

418
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
They are in a safe place.

419
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Life goes by so fast.

420
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
I have been in the palace for half a month.

421
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
I have gradually adapted to the world.

422
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,560
But there is always a good day.

423
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
They say that the people in the east are wonderful.

424
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
How is it?

425
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
How do you feel when you just ran away?

426
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
It's good.

427
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Your tent is very far from here.

428
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Why are you here today?

429
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
I said that

430
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
when you are well,

431
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
I will take you back.

432
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
It's time to go home.

433
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
How do you know where my home is?

434
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Your family has been looking for you.

435
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Your Majesty!

436
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
The palace is still in chaos.

437
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
It's not peaceful yet.

438
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Your Highness,

439
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
your children need you.

440
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
You always know.

441
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
There are some things

442
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
that we should face.

443
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Your Highness,

444
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
let's go.

445
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Let's go.

446
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Hurry up.

447
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Thank you.

448
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Later,

449
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
I calmed down.

450
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
I returned to the world again.

451
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
But I know

452
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
that what I have in my heart

453
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
has changed.

454
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Your Majesty,

455
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
the wind fan that Danyong Palace and the Green Sky Sword

456
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
have built together

457
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
is now in vain.

458
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Anything else?

459
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Hurry up and follow Wang Chang.

460
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
The day is getting better.

461
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
It's midnight.

462
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Your Majesty.

463
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
What's wrong?

464
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
The earthquake in Dansui Mountain

465
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
and the wind fan is gone.

466
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
The palace in Danyong Palace

467
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
is in grave danger.

468
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Many people are buried down there.

469
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Hurry up.

470
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
I don't know.

471
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
I have sent people to investigate.

472
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
Your Majesty,

473
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
someone saw the wind fan

474
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
that Danyong Palace and the Green Sky Sword.

475
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
He is in danger.

476
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
He is in danger.

477
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
He is in danger.

478
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
He is in danger.

479
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
He is in danger.

480
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Your Majesty,

481
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
someone saw the wind fan

482
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
that Danyong Palace and the Green Sky Sword.

483
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
He is back to the camp.

484
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
But it's been a long time.

485
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
He is going to the southwest.

486
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Your Majesty,

487
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
He Duo is going to the west.

488
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
You stay here.

489
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Don't follow him.

490
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Your Majesty.

491
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Hurry up.

492
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Hurry up.

493
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Keduo,

494
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
where are you going?

495
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Your Highness,

496
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Dansui Mountain is in grave danger.

497
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
The wind fan is gone.

498
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
I am going back to report it.

499
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
This is not the grave danger.

500
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
What happened?

501
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
What did you do?

502
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
What happened?

503
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
You found the ghost blood.

504
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
So he hid it

505
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
under the mountain range of Dansui Mountain.

506
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
You have found it long ago.

507
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
You came for him.

508
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
Your Highness,

509
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
please stop asking.

510
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
You must give me the thing.

511
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Keduo,

512
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,560
do you know what the ghost blood is?

513
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Do you know why?

514
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
I would never be defeated by you.

515
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
I don't need it.

516
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
My mother

517
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
used the ghost blood

518
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
in your battle.

519
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,560
Eventually,

520
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
she caused a disaster

521
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
in the human world.

522
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
She died because of it.

523
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
She left a sign

524
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
to let the back of the East Xia

525
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
to find it.

526
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
I don't even know

527
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
where the ghost blood is.

528
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Until today,

529
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Keduo,

530
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
the ghost blood is not the cure.

531
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
If you keep it,

532
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
it will cause you

533
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
a endless disaster.

534
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
Thank you for telling me.

535
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
I must take it back.

536
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Keduo,

537
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
please.

538
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Give it to me.

539
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
I won't use it

540
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
to use it.

541
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Don't leave either.

542
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Let's be in the East Xia together.

543
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Just like when I was recuperating.

544
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Okay?

545
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Are you feeling better?

546
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Yes.

547
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,560
That's good.

548
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
You're not leaving, are you?

549
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Please hug me.

550
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Okay?

551
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,560
I'm afraid we'll never see each other again.

552
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Don't worry.

553
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
This is just a drug.

554
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
It will be back soon.

555
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
I've been writing this book

556
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
for many years.

557
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
It's written in it

558
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
that it's useful to look at the magic

559
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
and to use it to purify the sword.

560
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,560
I'll leave it to you now.

561
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,560
Maybe it'll be useful

562
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
for the East Xia in the future.

563
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
I'll leave it to you.

564
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
I'll leave it to you.

565
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
I'll leave it to you.

566
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
I'll leave it to you.

567
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
I'll leave it to you.

568
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
I'll leave it to you.

569
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
I'll leave it to you.

570
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
I'm sorry.

571
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Guando,

572
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
I'm sorry.

573
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Actually,

574
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
the story has been decided

575
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
since the beginning.

576
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Your father died

577
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
in my life,

578
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,560
but he taught me a lesson.

579
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,560
We all have our own destiny.

580
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,560
I've never thought about fighting him.

581
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
Because I know

582
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
the person he wants to see

583
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
is not me.

584
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
But I never thought

585
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
that day

586
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
would be the last time we met.

587
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Leave.

588
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
A month later,

589
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
I received the last news

590
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
of the visit

591
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
of the Kuaiduo.

592
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
The Kuaiduo family was destroyed.

593
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
No one was alive.

594
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
He and the most important person

595
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
in his heart died together.

596
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
You all leave too.

597
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
And I can't live

598
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
the person in his heart

599
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,560
for the rest of my life.

600
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
I'm sorry.

601
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,560
But I'll remember him for the rest of my life.

602
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
You're kidding me.

603
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Some people

604
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
are so miserable.

605
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Some people

606
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
are so cruel.

607
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
But I only allow myself

608
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,560
to cry for him once.

609
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
No matter what happens,

610
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
I can only

611
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,560
be

612
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
the queen of the East.

613
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
The operation he left

614
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
helped the East

615
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
and made the people

616
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
pay for it.

617
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
And the coffin

618
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,560
of the Kuaiduo

619
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,560
was made

620
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
by the memory

621
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,560
of the book

622
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
that was

623
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
written by him.

624
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,560
You're his child.

625
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,560
I'll give it back to you now.

626
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,560
I'll give it back to you.

627
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,560
I'll give it back to you.

628
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,560
So you're

629
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
the old man of my father.

630
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
I was wrong about you.

631
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
I didn't expect

632
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
that

633
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
someone from the Kuaiduo family

634
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,560
would still live.

635
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
My daughter

636
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
has so many

637
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
children from the Kuaiduo family.

638
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,560
This time I came to Da Yong

639
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,560
to find the map.

640
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,560
There's still a big thing to do.

641
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
Now I'm going to see

642
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
the people

643
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
who can help me.

644
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,560
The map is the life of my life.

645
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,560
The map is the life of my life.

646
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
The map is the road

647
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,560
that I've always hated.

648
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,560
The light of the old man

649
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,560
is not dark

650
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,560
even the bed of the old man.

651
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Only because

652
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,560
I'm so sad.

653
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,560
I'm the rebel.

654
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
I'm the rich.

655
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,560
I'm the heartbreak.

656
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,560
I will always

657
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
be with you.

658
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,560
I'm the born.

659
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,560
I'm the man.

660
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,560
I'm the rain.

661
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,560
I'm the one who will always be with you.

662
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
I'm the king.

663
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
I'm the king.

664
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
I'm the king.

665
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,560
I'm the man.

666
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,560
I'm the man.

667
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,560
I'm the born.

668
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,560
You are me.
