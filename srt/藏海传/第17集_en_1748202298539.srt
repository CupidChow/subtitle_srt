00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 13

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everyone has pain and confusion.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's not surprising that Pingjing is a man.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you want to get her support,

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
you must be very careful.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What is Pingjing's pain?

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's about the person who has disappeared from the Zhuang family.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Shen Wan is Zhuang Lu Yin's father's old daughter.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Zhuang Lu Yin and Zhuang Lu Yin have always been close friends.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But in order to rebuild Zhuang family,

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Zhuang Lu Yin gave up on Shen Wan

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and married the daughter of the Minister of Rites, Jiang Xiang.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
From then on, she has been working hard for the sake of the Qing Yun.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
For the past 35 years,

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
she has been in the East for a great defeat.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
His Majesty wants her to stop the border guards.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Jiang Xiang doesn't want to suffer with her

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and will stay in the capital with Zhuang's manor.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Stop!

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The border guards are suffering.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And someone has appeared in her wild life.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That is Shen Wan.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Shen Wan has not been married for many years.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When he came to the border guard to take care of her father,

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
he finally met Zhuang Lu Yin and left the country.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They were both killed in the border guard

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and were killed by the son of the Minister of Rites.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When Zhuang Lu Yin ordered the order to make a move again,

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
when Zhuang Lu Yin decided to send troops again,

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
he was killed by the son of the Minister of Rites.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But when he was in the capital,

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
he was not a palace official.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He was a royal official.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He was a royal official.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He was a royal official.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He was a royal official.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He was a royal official.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He was a royal official.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
A border guard came to the border.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Jiang Xiang brought Zhuang's manor to find him.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He wanted to re-establish the border with Zhuang Lu Yin.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Zhuang Lu Yin was in trouble.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He wanted to make a bigger attack on his father.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If he was cold-hearted,

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
he would be punished for being a high-ranking general.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But how could he fail Shen Wan again?

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
At the time of his death,

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Shen Wan stood up.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He gave Zhuang Lu Yin the position of the Minister of Rites.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But Zhuang Lu Yin did not give up.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
After that, Zhuang Lu Yin finally got what he wanted.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He was a hero.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So he was a great hero.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He thought he could be safe.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He did not let Shen Wan suffer.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But he underestimated Jiang Xiang's ambition and intent.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Since you are in the court,

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
you should take the position of the Minister of Rites.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Leave the family to Xiang'er.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Jiang Xiang gradually understood him and Shen Wan.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
In the end, Zhuang Lu Yin believed in Shen Wan and was so lucky.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He poisoned him in his tombstone.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Mom!

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mom!

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Mom!

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mom!

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Mom!

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't want you to leave!

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I beg you!

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I beg you!

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mom!

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mom!

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Mom!

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Great grace is great revenge.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No one is willing to bear the grudge of your life.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The long-lasting grudge of the long-lasting love

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is not the end of the Western Aries.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It is the end of the grudge.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
People in this world are selfish.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They live more happily.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But why can't he detoxify this antidote?

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He can't let go of the Shen Wan he used to have.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Or he is guilty of his own intention.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No one can tell.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So he doesn't want to be separated from his lover.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because once he sees her,

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
he will think of the one who used to be despicable.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This kind of pain is getting deeper and deeper.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Which robber is willing to have such a weakness?

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
My lord, you are looking for me?

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you know why I asked you to come here?

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I know this place is where Second Young Master used to live.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
My lord asked me to come here

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because I told you about Second Young Master's whereabouts.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I told you that I was going to live here

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
because I told you about Second Young Master's whereabouts.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I told you that I was going to live here

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
because I told you about Second Young Master's whereabouts?

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This child, Zhi Xing,

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I used to love him a lot.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But later he got distant from me.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And these years, I treated him better than my father.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Zhi Xing became an unborn son.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I was wrong, too.

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
My lord, you are the master of the family.

108
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You are the master of the family.

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How could you be wrong?

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I was just thinking that

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
the outside world is full of the burden of the moon.

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But my lord came here alone.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I used to know a poor painter.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I was a poor painter.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I was poor for a long time.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I was getting more and more poor.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I didn't even have enough to raise myself.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Later he found that people loved Mudan.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
His family was very rich.

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He changed Mudan to a rich man.

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But he told me that he loved him more.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He was more willing to be with him.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He was still a painter.

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But it was too late.

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The painter in the painting

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
was so bright.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He was so sad.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When he was poor, he chose to be a painter.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He could see the heart of love.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But he changed Mudan to a rich man.

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And his beloved painter was so poor.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Maybe he felt that he was wrong.

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But I thought he was wrong.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why do you think so?

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The flower was born in winter.

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It was cold and snowy.

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It was not that the flower was not so beautiful.

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It was Mudan.

139
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The flower was willing to be in the cold war.

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It was so calm.

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If the flower was not so beautiful,

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm afraid that the whole garden

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
would be in the winter.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I want to write a poem.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The flower was not so beautiful.

146
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It was so bright.

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It was so bright.

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It was so cold.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It was so bright.

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was so bright.

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The flower was willing to be in the cold war.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But it was not so beautiful.

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It was not so beautiful.

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But it was not so beautiful.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Because he believed that

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
if he continued to grow,

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the flower would be reborn.

158
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The flower was willing to be in the cold war.

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Maybe he was not so beautiful.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But it was not so beautiful.

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
When the sun was out,

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
it was not so beautiful.

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If the sun was out,

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
it would be in the cold war.

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What did you tell my father?

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He began to ask me about my work.

167
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I think His Lordship is willing to be with you.

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
In the future, he will be more carefree

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
than the Manor of the Manor.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Because of you,

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
he is willing to be with me.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I said something that is not important at all.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What is important is

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
what kind of son you are in His Lordship's eyes.

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I am not a son.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I am a son.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So in the future,

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you must practice hard.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You must not be careless.

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes.

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Who is it?

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
My Lord, it is me, Zhuang Shan.

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
My Lord, please.

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I see.

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
My Lord, it is inside.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Lord Zhang, please.

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Lord Zhang.

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
My Lord.

189
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Every time I have something new,

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I will sit here.

191
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This place

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
can make me

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
think about something.

194
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I am willing to share it with you.

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Do you think

196
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the death of General Fuzhi Zong

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
is really an accident?

198
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I do not understand.

199
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The dead of the Jiao Tu

200
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
is a dead dog.

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It is a bird.

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It is a good job.

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Even if you have the power of the Qianqiu Palace,

204
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you cannot resist

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
the King's innocence.

206
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I think

207
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
His Lordship and General Fuzhi are different.

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
General Fuzhi is the nephew of the late Empress Dowager.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He is the son of His Majesty.

210
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He is the son of His Majesty.

211
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You once led the army to attack the Eastern Xia.

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You have done a great job.

213
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I think His Majesty

214
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
is grateful to you.

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When Fuzhi Zong died,

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
the position of the general of the army

217
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
was controlled.

218
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The court

219
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
is not more suitable

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
for people like me.

221
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Many people also

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
greet me like His Majesty.

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Tell me,

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
should I be the general?

225
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There are many generals in the army.

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You have been the one who led the army.

227
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You were the father of the old days.

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Now you are the leader of the Jin Dynasty.

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
If you go to Zengzhou to fight for the military power,

230
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I am afraid that His Majesty

231
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
will not be able to

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
defeat you.

233
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You asked me to do things

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
that are not easy to do.

235
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You are just a little bit more

236
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
jealous of others.

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
My Lord.

238
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are not fighting with others,

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
but with His Majesty.

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I think

241
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
His Majesty should have

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
already remembered it.

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
My Lord,

244
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
you should wait a few more days

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
to see who will be the winner.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
there must be a good place.

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If you want to re-enact the army,

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
there must be another way.

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
My Lord,

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
you need to do something for me.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
My Lord, please tell me.

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Once you know about this,

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
you will not be able to go back.

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You need to think it through.

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Zanghai is old and old.

257
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He is not worthy of his life.

258
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I have only

259
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
once defeated you in my life.

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It is not

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
anyone who

262
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
defeated me.

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It is a thing called

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
the Ghost-Ride.

265
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Ghost-Ride?

266
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
In the year of the 35th,

267
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
the late Emperor

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
led the army to leave the capital.

269
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I was appointed as the general of Xianfeng,

270
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and I had a lot of achievements

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
in the East.

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was a great man.

273
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But when I was about to enter the capital,

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I had a strange experience.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
General Yongbao.

276
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes.

277
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The Ghost-Ride

278
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The Ghost-Ride

279
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What is that?

280
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Fight!

281
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Kill!

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Kill!

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Kill!

284
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Kill!

285
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The Ghost-Ride

286
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
is as strong as a woman.

287
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Ghost-Ride.

288
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It brings countless soldiers.

289
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
They are monsters who can't kill.

290
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Any bear-died iron-died

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
can't stand them.

292
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Kill!

293
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So I swear

294
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I will find the Ghost-Ride.

295
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Six years later,

296
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I re-established the army.

297
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Once again,

298
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I re-established the East.

299
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I kept my promise.

300
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But this time,

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I lost the Ghost-Ride.

302
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I was under heavy pressure.

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But I have been in the East for three years.

304
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But I have never

305
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
found this treasure.

306
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is a man who was found by the guard.

307
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He found the Ghost-Ride in the East.

308
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He wanted to be his friend.

309
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I wanted to take it away from him,

310
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
but I couldn't.

311
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And this Tong Yu

312
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
must have something to do with the Ghost-Ride.

313
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Maybe

314
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
they are just talking.

315
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So the Ghost-Ride

316
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
is still with that man?

317
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
No.

318
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No.

319
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's not with him.

320
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But he is dead.

321
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's his fate.

322
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He must die

323
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
to take away the thing from His Lordship.

324
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Ten years later,

325
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I searched everywhere.

326
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But I couldn't find it.

327
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was already dead.

328
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But now you are here.

329
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's different.

330
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
My Lord,

331
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I hope you can find the Ghost-Ride.

332
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's right.

333
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I am willing to do anything for you.

334
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I will leave

335
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
this to you.

336
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes.

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
My Lord,

338
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
is there only one

339
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Tong Yu?

340
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What do you mean?

341
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I learned the technique of fishing

342
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
with my master.

343
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I have a good idea

344
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
about the culture in the East.

345
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The East

346
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
is mainly for fishing.

347
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So the fish

348
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
is for their own good.

349
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I have never seen it before.

350
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But I have seen

351
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
a lot of fish in the East.

352
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The fish in the fish tank

353
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
are all from the Cheng group.

354
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
They are willing to be brought back by the wind.

355
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So I

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
have this question.

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The sword is indeed extraordinary.

358
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's very clever.

359
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That's right.

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Tong Yu doesn't know one thing.

361
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I knew

362
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
you were the one

363
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
who made this.

364
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Do other Tong Yu

365
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
need me to find the fish?

366
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You don't have to

367
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
care about other Tong Yu.

368
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I have a plan.

369
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Just remember

370
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that when you find the ghost,

371
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I will not

372
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
lose you.

373
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The fire in the lake

374
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
will also help you

375
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
complete the wish.

376
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Ghost?

377
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I have heard

378
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,360
some rumors about the

379
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
East.

380
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It was called

381
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
the secret treasure of the King of the East.

382
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But it is

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
a bit of a trick.

384
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I always thought

385
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
it was only

386
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
a small thing

387
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
that was useless.

388
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I didn't expect

389
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
your father would find it.

390
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
He brought it back.

391
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I didn't expect

392
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I would help

393
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Pingjing to find it.

394
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Do you remember

395
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
the Tong Yu in Pingjing's secret treasure?

396
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I asked

397
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
for two more

398
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
of his projects

399
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and he said he had a lot of them.

400
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It seems that I guessed it right.

401
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It was in the hands

402
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
of the other two enemies.

403
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But even if Pingjing

404
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
trusts me so much,

405
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
she still won't

406
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
tell me

407
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
the third person's story.

408
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You have to eat one bite.

409
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes.

410
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Now we have

411
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
sold a lot of them.

412
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
At least you have

413
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
the benefit of Pingjing.

414
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You don't need

415
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
to hide it

416
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
from the past.

417
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Master.

418
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You said there is

419
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
a ghost wedding.

420
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't know.

421
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But I can be sure

422
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
of one thing.

423
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's your enemies.

424
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
They didn't give up on him

425
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
until today.

426
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It seems that

427
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
as long as we find the ghost wedding

428
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and Tong Yu,

429
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
we can find the third person.

430
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
My Lord.

431
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
My Lady.

432
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Zang Hai.

433
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Sit down.

434
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Sit down.

435
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What's your plan

436
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
for today?

437
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Do you know?

438
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The day before yesterday,

439
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
His Majesty called a general

440
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
to attack Changdao.

441
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I was sick and unwell.

442
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
His Majesty

443
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
personally appointed

444
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
the Imperial Guard

445
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
to serve as the commander.

446
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Those who were

447
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
in the middle of the military

448
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
were making

449
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
unethical officials

450
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and were punished by the generals.

451
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Although I was unwell,

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
His Majesty was not used to it.

453
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
He also mentioned

454
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
that I was sick

455
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and unwell.

456
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You are wise.

457
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You are not strong.

458
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You are more than happy.

459
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There is one more thing.

460
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
A few days ago,

461
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I gave the Imperial Guard a memorial.

462
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I gave you a meeting.

463
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Zang Hai.

464
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You are very capable.

465
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You are very wise.

466
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
His Majesty

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
gave you great grace.

468
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
From today on,

469
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
you will be the witness of the Heavenly Sword.

470
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Congratulations.

471
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Zang Hai.

472
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
No.

473
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Lord Zang.

474
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Thank you, Marquis.

475
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Thank you, Mr. Zang.

476
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Sit.

477
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The Heavenly Sword

478
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and the Ministry of Justice

479
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
are close.

480
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You and Zhifu

481
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
will have many opportunities

482
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
to do things together.

483
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You two should be

484
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
grateful to His Majesty

485
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
for your efforts.

486
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I will take good care

487
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
of Zang Hai.

488
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Thank you, Mr. Zang.

489
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Zang Hai has been in the woods for half a year.

490
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
He has made the Imperial Sword.

491
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Chu Huai Ming is very good at learning.

492
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
How can he be better than Mr. Zang?

493
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's all thanks to Marquis's care

494
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
that you have taken care of the Imperial Guard.

495
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The Imperial Sword is made of nothing.

496
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You will have your own house.

497
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The house that Chu Huai Ming had

498
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
is not very good.

499
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I chose a new one for you.

500
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You can take it away

501
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
tomorrow.

502
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I will go in.

503
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Your Highness, I am very grateful.

504
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I will never forget it.

505
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
No matter where I am in the future,

506
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I will always remember

507
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
that I came out of Marquis's Mansion.

508
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
All right.

509
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I will not have to

510
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
support you anymore.

511
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I will be the one to support you.

512
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yes, Your Highness.

513
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Your Excellency.

514
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Father.

515
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Father.

516
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You are used to it too.

517
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Why don't you make a carriage?

518
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
When making a carriage,

519
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
two legs are also used to it.

520
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Moreover,

521
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
if you are used to making a carriage,

522
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
you can stop walking.

523
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You can't get off anymore.

524
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Stop.

525
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Stop.

526
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yes.

527
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Greetings, Your Excellency.

528
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Please come in.

529
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Father.

530
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Father, I am singing again.

531
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I can even pass the cemeteries.

532
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It has been so long.

533
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Do you know what this cemeteries

534
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
are used for?

535
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I care about it.

536
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Then do you know

537
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
how to care about it?

538
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't know.

539
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Do you want to learn it?

540
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yes.

541
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Come here.

542
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Do you know the four-wheeled swing on it?

543
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Try to turn it.

544
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Slow down.

545
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Slow down.

546
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Come a little bit more.

547
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Come a little bit more.

548
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yes.

549
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You are moving the upper back

550
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and the upper back.

551
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You can move three specials.

552
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
By the way,

553
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
you can see

554
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the brightest star

555
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
through this hole.

556
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Really?

557
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Greetings, Your Excellency.

558
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Please rise.

559
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Your Excellency.

560
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I am

561
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Tianwen Si Wuguan Si Lilang

562
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
from Min Shining.

563
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I am

564
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Loukos Wuguan

565
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
from Chiehu Lang, Linwei.

566
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I am

567
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Shenmusi Wuguan from ShanYu Lang,

568
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
from ShangJiu.

569
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Your Excellency,

570
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I am Xiang Duo Si

571
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
from Wuguan, Fenshuang.

572
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I am

573
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Xie Wuxi.

574
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I am

575
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Xiang Duo Si,

576
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
from Wuguan, Fenshuang.

577
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I am Chang Wuyi.

578
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Where is Marquis Jian?

579
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Your Excellency,

580
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Marquis Jian is

581
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Wuguan, Pingyi Lang, Shi Quan.

582
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
He is in a critical situation.

583
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
We can't

584
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
come to your service.

585
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's okay.

586
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Your Excellency,

587
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
we have finally

588
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
sent you here.

589
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The Imperial Court

590
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
has sent a letter

591
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
to the Imperial Court

592
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
to cure the heart disease.

593
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Although the room is small,

594
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
it is still

595
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
a matter of care and care.

596
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It is also a matter of money.

597
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It needs

598
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
to be separated for many years.

599
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You all

600
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
have been

601
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
spending more time

602
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
in the room

603
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
than I have.

604
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
There are many things

605
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
to do in the future.

606
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You all need to

607
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
help each other.

608
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Your Excellency,

609
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
you are too modest.

610
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
If you say so,

611
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
how should we

612
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
treat these people?

613
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Your Excellency,

614
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I am curious

615
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
how you

616
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
can be a young man

617
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
and be a witness

618
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
to your life.

619
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Today's meeting

620
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
is indeed extraordinary.

621
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Compared with the others,

622
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I am just

623
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
a coward.

624
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Don't be

625
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
envious of

626
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
my stupidness

627
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
in the future.

628
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You need to know

629
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
more about me

630
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
so that

631
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I can be ugly.

632
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We have finished talking.

633
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's time to talk about the work.

634
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Have you brought

635
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
the personal jewellery?

636
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yes.

637
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's start with Tianwen Temple.

638
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Your Excellency,

639
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Tianwen Temple's work

640
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
is a long-term observation

641
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and monitoring the world.

642
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
The main focus is

643
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
on the cultivation of the land.

644
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's important to

645
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
have a clear understanding of the situation

646
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
so that the people

647
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
can be a good and healthy person

648
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and have a good rest.

649
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The main responsibility of

650
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
the Luokos

651
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
is to grow the lake

652
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and to make a good harvest.

653
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Although it's a small matter,

654
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
it's still a surprise.

655
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Shenmusi's daily work

656
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
is to build a building

657
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and collect wood.

658
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Since this spring,

659
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
the precious wood

660
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
provided by the palace

661
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
includes the yellow, pear,

662
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
purple and purple wood,

663
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and the wood of the tree.

664
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It has a total of 3,000 roots.

665
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Your Excellency,

666
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
the main responsibility of the Luokos

667
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
is to collect the land and the wood of the mountain.

668
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Shenmusi's work is to investigate the situation.

669
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The important thing is

670
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
to restore the land to the general.

671
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Very good.

672
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You all stay here.

673
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Today is my first day of work.

674
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
There are many places

675
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
that I don't know.

676
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I will mark the place

677
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
in the document.

678
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
If there is any question,

679
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I will visit you

680
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
alone in the future.

681
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Please go back.

682
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Your Excellency,

683
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
let's go to the study room.

684
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The study room is still in order.

685
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Please follow me.

686
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
No.

687
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Take me to the守ry room first.

688
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The most challenging part of the practice

689
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
is the seal and the seal.

690
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
The seal

691
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
is to be used to make the skin

692
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
more firm and soft.

693
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The seal and the skin

694
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
will have a sharp and loose edge.

695
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The seal is usually used

696
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
to make the face.

697
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But the general doesn't respect the land.

698
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So we have to use the wood of the mountain

699
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
to make the body.

700
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Do you understand?

701
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yes.

702
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yes, sir.

703
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
The bones of these places

704
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
have been broken.

705
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
We also have to use the copper wire.

706
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Sir.

707
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
No need for this.

708
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Cut it.

709
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Sir.

710
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Sir.

711
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Sir.

712
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Sir.

713
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Who are you?

714
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Are you all right?

715
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I have something to talk to you alone.

716
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You guys go out first.

717
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yes.

718
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Yes.

719
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yes.

720
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Are you here to apologize?

721
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I am not.

722
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
The general's body is sent by the capital.

723
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We have to deal with it as soon as possible.

724
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I hope you can forgive me.

725
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
His Majesty ordered General Fu to bury the body.

726
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think it's right for you to take care of it

727
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
after a few days on the road.

728
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It will take more than an hour

729
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
to bury it in the east.

730
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I think you were teaching them.

731
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Why do they only help you

732
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
when it's so important?

733
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Mr. Chu thinks that

734
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
the work of the training is not complicated.

735
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
He cut off the staff of our prison

736
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and opened the gate.

737
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I am the only one here.

738
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Sometimes I call the students to help.

739
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
They are all people who come to pay their respects.

740
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So I am a little confused.

741
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Let me help you.

742
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
No.

743
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I didn't expect that you are so good at cooking.

744
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I have learned it when I was a kid

745
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and I didn't learn it well.

746
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
If you want to do this,

747
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
not only do you need to have talent,

748
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
but also a lot of patience.

749
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Sir, I'm sorry.

750
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You've been in the Qingtian Sword for many years, right?

751
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You've been staying here all this time?

752
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Sir, you don't have to be so polite with me.

753
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You can just say whatever you want.

754
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You came here to search for treasures

755
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
or to make a living out of it?

756
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't want to know.

757
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I hope that you can let me

758
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
be alone and do things for you.

759
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'll do my best.

760
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Every day,

761
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
you need to clean up your hair

762
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
until it's dry and dry.

763
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Sir,

764
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
you have to be on duty.

765
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Inform the kitchen.

766
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You have to do your best tonight.

767
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Understand?

768
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
In the future,

769
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
you and I

770
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Sir.

771
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Sir.

772
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Okay.

773
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Leave.

774
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm back.

775
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I've called all the officials I met today.

776
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
No, no, no.

777
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Turn around.

778
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Turn around.

779
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Two tables.

780
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Master.

781
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
This dress is quite real.

782
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Your first dress in the capital is suitable for your job.

783
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Now you're wearing a official uniform.

784
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Okay.

785
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
If you let the old man see this,

786
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
you'll have to fix the length of the sleeves again.

787
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
How is it today? Tell me.

788
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The new world is no different from what my father was.

789
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
At that time, everyone was all thinking about it.

790
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
They were all thinking about it.

791
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
As long as my father can help, he will definitely help.

792
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And now, everyone is looking at the devil.

793
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
There's no one who's sincere.

794
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

795
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Your father is a little figure in the white market.

796
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
What does it have to do with Qing Tianjian?

797
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You have a coffin now.

798
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's not like there's a person in the manor who's been taking care of you.

799
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
As long as you trust me, you'll be fine.

800
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
In the official market, there are people who are all looking at you.

801
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You have to be more careful.

802
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Master is right.

803
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Now, there are many people who are confused by the new world.

804
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm afraid that they can't find a way to find a way out in the future.

805
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Chu Huanming is aware of the fact that

806
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I heard a lot about Qing Tianjian's funeral.

807
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Have you heard of the funeral of the former minister of the Lin family?

808
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That was three years ago.

809
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The former minister of the Lin family was just 13 years old.

810
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But he was looked down upon by the eldest son of the evil palace.

811
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
He had to be punished.

812
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But the eldest son is 30 years older than him.

813
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He's not willing to die.

814
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What a coincidence.

815
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
The eldest son died in the end of the year because of the death of the daughter of Xi.

816
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
The Lin family thought that this had passed.

817
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But who knows that after he died,

818
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
the Lin family suddenly disappeared.

819
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Where did you find him?

820
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Where?

821
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The purpose of the evil palace.

822
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He was carried by a new bride.

823
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But the old man of the Lin family was crazy.

824
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
He was determined to marry a girl.

825
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
That's a good thing for the people.

826
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The court is very strict with the power.

827
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Maybe the Lin family's funeral is what Qing Tianjian did.

828
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Not only that, last October,

829
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Qing Tianjian thought that the officials selected the title

830
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and handed over all the fruits of the Wang family.

831
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,000
I feel sorry for the villagers that.

832
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
This is to be met with great Nämen.

833
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

834
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

835
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

836
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

837
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

838
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

839
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

840
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

841
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

842
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

843
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

844
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

845
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

846
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful

847
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I am the one who is the most beautiful
