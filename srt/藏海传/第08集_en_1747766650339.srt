1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No

3
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Say it

4
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
What do you want to die for?

5
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
My Lord

6
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,160
I don't want to die

7
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,320
You are so desperate in front of the officials

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Don't you know you will die?

9
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
I am born poor

10
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,320
If I die alone in a bad situation

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,320
What difference does it make whether I die or not?

12
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
I am not a god

13
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
I am not a god

14
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
So I want to fight

15
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
I want to fight

16
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Right now

17
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
It won't be too long

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,480
I will kill you when the carriage stops

19
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
What else?

20
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
I will tell you now

21
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,480
I know you are born poor

22
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
You are born poor

23
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
You have seen many soldiers

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
You have seen many soldiers

25
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
You won't believe what happened today

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
You won't believe what happened today

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
It has something to do with Yin and Yang

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
But I

29
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
I shouldn't die today

30
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Where isashirai?

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
You know how to watch the fish

32
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
You can dig your own escape route

33
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
You can dig your own escape route

34
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
And you come out of the jungle

35
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
And you come out of the jungle

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
You want me

37
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
You want me to be in the eyes of the people

38
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
You have to let go

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Otherwise they will know you are not dead

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
I want to escape

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
It's easy to get away from them.

42
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
But I'm afraid that after this,

43
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
no one will be able to face them.

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,640
I'm willing to get the duke's jewellery.

45
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,640
So I can get away from the poor and the poor.

46
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,640
If I want to serve the duke,

47
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,640
I need a clear identity.

48
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
I'll do my best.

49
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Besides, I'm a human too.

50
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Someone wants to kill me.

51
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,640
I can't sit and wait.

52
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,640
I'll do my best to get justice from the duke.

53
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Justice?

54
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,640
I've seen your ability.

55
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
But now,

56
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,640
you're better than before.

57
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,640
You said you were lucky to have me.

58
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,640
But you forced me to lose my honor

59
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,640
and my honor.

60
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Do you think you deserve to die?

61
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,640
I didn't do anything wrong.

62
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Because I know

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,640
you've had enough useless people.

64
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,640
You mean the first person I like is a loser?

65
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
You're a noble man.

66
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,640
The one who follows you is not a talent.

67
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,640
But the one who has it is the master.

68
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
If you can't be with me,

69
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,640
you're useless.

70
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Say it.

71
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Lord Yang.

72
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
We have to be patient.

73
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Not only for the duke,

74
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,640
we also have to be patient for the duke.

75
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm not afraid of the duke.

76
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
I'm not afraid of the duke.

77
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,640
I'm not afraid of the duke.

78
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
I'm not afraid of the duke.

79
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Not only for the duke,

80
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,640
we have to be patient.

81
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,640
I think there were many people

82
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
who came to the duke's mansion before.

83
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,640
But they couldn't get to the duke's mansion.

84
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,640
The only people left were useless people.

85
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
But if they were just patient,

86
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
it's okay.

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,640
These people are dangerous.

88
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
They're very dangerous.

89
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,640
I'm afraid they'll bring trouble to the duke's mansion.

90
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
What trouble?

91
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
The duke's mansion has a lot of power.

92
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
These years,

93
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
they've been very violent.

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
But some people

95
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
are very violent

96
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
because of the duke's name.

97
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
I don't know how many enemies they've recruited.

98
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
They only want the duke's mansion to be their base.

99
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,640
That's why they've been safe these years.

100
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Violence

101
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,640
is my usual way of doing things.

102
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,640
They only learn from the duke.

103
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,640
But as long as they're loyal to me,

104
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
even if they're arrogant,

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
it's okay.

106
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
I'm afraid they've been

107
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,640
very strict with the duke.

108
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,640
But they've forgotten their duty in the north.

109
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,640
They're used to

110
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
taking their own opinions

111
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,640
as the duke's.

112
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Lord Qu

113
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,640
hasn't waited for the duke's order yet.

114
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,640
He shot Yang Zhen without permission.

115
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Even though he was thinking for the duke,

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
he still tried to do something.

117
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
If you don't believe me,

118
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
wait and see

119
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,640
if Lord Qu

120
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
will make a fool of me

121
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,640
for the duke's sake.

122
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,640
The duke has decided

123
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
my life and death.

124
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Stop!

125
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Get out of the car.

126
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Stop!

127
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Why did you stop the car at the back door?

128
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
The back door is closed.

129
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
We'll do it later.

130
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
I'll be right back.

131
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Zhang Hai,

132
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
do you have anything else to say?

133
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
I will

134
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
do anything.

135
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
I will.

136
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
My lord.

137
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Find a doctor to treat his wounds.

138
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
Tell Chu Huai Ming

139
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
to change his name

140
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
and delete the official title of Zang Hai.

141
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Report Yang Zhen's birth date

142
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
and tell him

143
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
that Zhang is Yang Zhen.

144
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,640
He will be buried.

145
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
My lord.

146
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
Zang Hai is too ambitious.

147
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
He can't control himself. He should be killed.

148
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Do you think

149
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
I can't control myself

150
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
or you can't control yourself?

151
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
I'll be right back.

152
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Thank you, doctor.

153
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
You're welcome.

154
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Just pay more for the treatment.

155
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Be careful.

156
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Master, why are you here?

157
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm worried about you.

158
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Don't worry. The doctors

159
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
are here.

160
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm the doctor

161
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
who was invited by the government.

162
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

163
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Let me see.

164
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Master,

165
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
if you keep bothering them,

166
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
I won't be able to leave the Imperial Garden.

167
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
You're old.

168
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
You made Yang Zhen angry

169
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
and forced them to fight.

170
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
They want your life.

171
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,640
I want them to fight.

172
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Once they fight,

173
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
they will show their weakness.

174
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Then I'll have a chance to win.

175
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Master, I need you

176
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
to do two things for me.

177
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
You follow the small river

178
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
to the upper right.

179
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
You'll find a dam

180
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
with no guard.

181
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
The old river

182
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
caused the stream to

183
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
flow into the lower part of the river.

184
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
It's a good way to get into the Imperial Garden.

185
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
The water in the dam

186
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
is very strong.

187
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I'll use the dam

188
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
to draw the water into the Imperial Garden.

189
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
You'll be buried there.

190
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Keep your guard down.

191
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Bow!

192
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Every step you take in the funeral

193
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

194
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
You need to be prepared

195
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
for the sixth hour.

196
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Put down the Dragon Stone!

197
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
When the ninth bell rings,

198
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
you close the dam.

199
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
The water in the dam

200
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
will slowly decrease.

201
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,640
The Dragon Stone will stop.

202
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Then you light the incense.

203
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
I'll find a way

204
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
to get out of the tomb.

205
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
I'll find a way

206
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
to get out of the tomb.

207
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,640
I'll find a way

208
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
to get out of the tomb.

209
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
I'll find a way

210
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
to get out of the tomb.

211
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,640
I'll find a way

212
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,640
to get out of the tomb.

213
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Zang Hai,

214
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,640
why did you come out?

215
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
If the Dragon Stone can't be dropped,

216
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
what did you do?

217
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,640
I didn't do anything.

218
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
I shouldn't have died!

219
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,640
As long as I come out,

220
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
it will naturally fall.

221
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
I want all officials

222
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
to believe that

223
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
as long as Yang Zhen enters the tomb,

224
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
the Dragon Stone will fall.

225
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
At the same time,

226
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
I will try to stall

227
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
and wait for the incense to run out.

228
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Lord Chu once told me

229
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
to comfort the spirit of the late emperor.

230
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
He needs a person

231
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
who can be with the late emperor

232
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
and stay in the imperial mausoleum forever.

233
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Who is that?

234
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Yang Zhen!

235
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
You're talking nonsense!

236
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
When the incense is out,

237
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
open the water gate.

238
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Zang Hai,

239
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
God bless you.

240
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
My lord!

241
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
It's past midnight.

242
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
I'm just dying.

243
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
I'm not dead.

244
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
If I get you all involved,

245
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
I will die!

246
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
At this moment,

247
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
the most important moment has come.

248
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
I bet Pingjing Duke will not be able to hold back

249
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
and let Yang Zhen enter the mausoleum.

250
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
My lord!

251
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
He's trying to pull me

252
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
out of the mausoleum.

253
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
God bless my disciple.

254
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
He's so handsome.

255
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
My lord!

256
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Mingde! Mingde!

257
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
My lord! Get me out of here!

258
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Mingde!

259
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Mingde!

260
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Mingde!

261
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Mingde!

262
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
The mausoleum is not that easy to get through.

263
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
It's only a few hours.

264
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
The officials have submitted the memorial.

265
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
If the news is not from the palace,

266
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
I will be in trouble

267
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
if I don't make it to the court tomorrow.

268
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
Since I dare to visit my father,

269
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,640
I can always kill people in the mausoleum.

270
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
These old people are really hateful.

271
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
I have to find a way

272
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
to stop them. How?

273
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Qu Jiao is fighting in front of everyone.

274
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
It's easy to stop one person.

275
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
How can you stop a hundred people?

276
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
If you don't let them know,

277
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
those officials will be worse.

278
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
What do they know?

279
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
They just want you to explain to them.

280
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Since you can't stop them,

281
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
let's just hand them over.

282
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
You want me to hand Qu Jiao over?

283
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Qu Jiao has been with my father

284
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
for many years.

285
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
How can I push him out of the mausoleum?

286
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
This whole thing

287
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,640
started because of the mausoleum.

288
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
If it wasn't for him,

289
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Yang Zhen wouldn't have died.

290
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
The mausoleum is over.

291
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Don't mention it again.

292
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
How about this?

293
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Kill the mausoleum

294
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
and hand him over to Qu Jiao.

295
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
This mausoleum is too dangerous.

296
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
If I stay with my father,

297
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
I will regret it.

298
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Father, time is running out.

299
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
You go out first.

300
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Yes.

301
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
You go out first.

302
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Yes.

303
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,640
What do you think

304
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Pingjing Duke will do?

305
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
I think he heard what he said today.

306
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640
Master, you don't have to worry too much.

307
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
Why are you so sure?

308
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Pingjing Duke is a martial artist.

309
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
Everything he does now

310
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
is obtained through martial arts.

311
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
So he must know

312
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
the dangers of martial arts.

313
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
The mausoleum is over.

314
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,640
Hand the rest to Tianming.

315
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Master, you can say that?

316
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
This is not like you.

317
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,640
Didn't you tell me not to worry too much?

318
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
I believe you.

319
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Let's go.

320
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Let's go.

321
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Let's go.

322
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Let's go.

323
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,640
Master, what's wrong?

324
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
The lord ordered that

325
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
no one is allowed to leave the mansion

326
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
in three days.

327
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
What happened?

328
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Lord Qu died last night.

329
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
From this year on,

330
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,640
you are the head of the mansion.

331
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,640
You get 20 taels of salary every month.

332
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
You don't have to go back to the mansion.

333
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
You live in the courtyard of the mansion.

334
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,640
The lord chose this place

335
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,640
for you personally.

336
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,640
The garden of the lord.

337
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,640
It's convenient for you to enter.

338
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Lord, come with me.

339
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Please.

340
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
These mausoleum and maidens

341
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
are all ordered by the lord.

342
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
And a box of cloth,

343
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,640
a house of treasure, and some money

344
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
are also used by you.

345
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Are you satisfied?

346
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Thank you, lord.

347
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,640
You can all leave.

348
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
When Lord Yang Zhen and Lord Yang

349
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
were in their prime,

350
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
they couldn't move into the courtyard of the mansion.

351
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Lord,

352
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
please have lunch with us today.

353
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
I see.

354
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,640
I'll leave first.

355
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Please.

356
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
Lord Yang, please.

357
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Lord, madam.

358
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
Don't be shy.

359
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Let's go.

360
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Zang Hai,

361
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
you've worked hard these months.

362
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,640
This is all your contribution.

363
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Come on, I'll toast you with this wine.

364
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
You don't have to thank me.

365
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
I'm just doing my best.

366
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
I'm just doing what the lord

367
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
and lord Yang Zhen told me to do.

368
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Since you're the lord's servant,

369
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
you must be proud

370
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
of your ability

371
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
to manage the mansion.

372
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
I'm flattered.

373
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
If you need anything from me,

374
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
I'll do my best.

375
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
Zang Hai,

376
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
I've thought about it.

377
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
The wood that the lord

378
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
and lord Yang Zhen left

379
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
is useless.

380
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
I'll just send it to you.

381
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
What do you think?

382
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Lord, you're too kind.

383
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
I'm the lord's servant.

384
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
I'll leave everything

385
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,640
to you.

386
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
I'll leave everything to you.

387
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Zhuang Shan.

388
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Yes.

389
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
Keep some old people

390
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
and leave the rest to me.

391
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Yes, lord.

392
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Sit.

393
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
In a few days,

394
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
your father will be the heir.

395
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
You'll be the first to pay a visit to the mansion

396
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
and then go to the garden to worship.

397
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
You should prepare well.

398
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
It's important to worship the late lord.

399
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
I just got married.

400
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,640
I dare not sit on the table.

401
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
The people who can sit on the table

402
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
are the ones

403
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
I trust the most.

404
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
You've done a great job

405
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,640
in taking care of my family.

406
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Your business

407
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,640
is my top priority.

408
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
I'll do my best

409
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
for you.

410
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Don't just say no. Drink.

411
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
I'll drink.

412
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,340
Use with the sword.

413
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,940
After this forced visit,

414
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Yujing is safe for now.

415
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Father, this Zang Hai has really touched on the Emperor's thoughts.

416
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
The Yan Guanyin's memorials have been stopped.

417
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,940
The Emperor has also rewarded you with the merit of maintaining the Zang Li.

418
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,940
It's just that Zang Hai is too deep in the city and it's hard to predict.

419
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,940
If you keep him by your side, your son will feel uneasy.

420
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,940
This huge capital, are you afraid that you won't be able to find a master?

421
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,940
Rather than having a group of pigs,

422
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,940
it's better to have a wolf.

423
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,940
Father is right.

424
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,940
In the Hou family, there is a father who will be the head of the family.

425
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,940
Whatever kind of servants, he can have.

426
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Although I live in the left and right of the Emperor, I have the power.

427
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,940
But it's not the time to lead the army in the border.

428
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Your grandfather is now a minister and he won't be in the court.

429
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Chifu,

430
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,940
the future of the Zhuang family,

431
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,940
you must bear it well.

432
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,940
To have such a blood-sweating father,

433
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,940
Chifu,

434
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,940
I will not disappoint you.

435
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,940
I will help you to get to a higher level in the official field.

436
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,940
It's best to get a good place to stay.

437
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,940
In the future, you will be as good as the Inner Council.

438
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
But before that,

439
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,940
you need help from someone to plan a plan for you.

440
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Zang Hai is the person I chose for you.

441
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,940
I don't know if you really want to use Zang Hai as your son.

442
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,940
The talent of the left is very proud.

443
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,940
What's important is how the master should train him.

444
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,940
If he doesn't listen,

445
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,940
he will break his bones.

446
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
A useless person

447
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,940
will not think about how to train him.

448
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
He just entered the house.

449
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,940
If he feels that his future is not bright,

450
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,940
he will do his best.

451
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,940
I will teach you his cold feet.

452
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,940
And then teach you how to do it.

453
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,940
You just need to remember

454
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,940
the honor of the Zhuang family

455
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,940
is not yours.

456
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,940
The honor of the Zhuang family

457
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
is not yours.

458
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,940
I understand.

459
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,940
Chu Huai Ming

460
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,940
is getting more and more careless.

461
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
He has been in the official field for more than ten years.

462
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,940
He has not been able to do anything else.

463
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,940
His ability to act is the top priority.

464
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,940
Zhuang Shan.

465
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
My Lord.

466
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,940
Give these to Zang Hai.

467
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,940
The only person who knows these things

468
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,940
is not Chu Huai Ming.

469
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,940
Yes.

470
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,940
let's go and drink some tea.

471
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
It's the last thing you can do now.

472
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,940
Little girl, let's go to the warehouse.

473
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Go.

474
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,940
Go.

475
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,940
Go.

476
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,940
Go.

477
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,940
Go.

478
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,940
Go.

479
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,940
Go.

480
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Go.

481
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Go.

482
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,940
Go.

483
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Go.

484
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,940
Go.

485
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,940
Okay. This way, please.

486
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,940
Please go ahead and look for it. I'll go down and look for the guests.

487
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,940
Thank you.

488
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,940
Sir, you want the stock.

489
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,940
The price is high.

490
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,940
I'm afraid you're going to break the price.

491
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,940
I'm the first woodlion in the household.

492
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,940
Who dares to say I have no money?

493
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Good boy. I didn't raise you for nothing.

494
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,940
Sir, I've added all of this.

495
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Then you took it out just to show off?

496
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,940
Didn't you think you were filial to me?

497
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
Sir, don't make things difficult for me.

498
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,940
The salary this month is not enough.

499
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
Look at you.

500
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
How about this?

501
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,940
Pingjing Hou has a lot of treasures.

502
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,940
You're going to see them one by one.

503
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
He definitely doesn't know.

504
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,940
Let's steal their money first.

505
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,940
We'll talk about it when we're hungry.

506
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
You go ahead. Don't drag me down.

507
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
Sit down.

508
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,940
I heard that Pingjing Hou has disbanded most of the woodlions in the household.

509
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,940
Pingjing Hou is so extreme.

510
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,940
He's not a nobody.

511
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
He killed my family of 14 people.

512
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,940
He didn't do anything wrong.

513
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,940
He's been giving me some fish-fishing business.

514
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,940
These jobs must have been done by Chu Huai Ming.

515
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,940
Chu Huai Ming must be angry.

516
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,940
What are they?

517
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,940
Some fish-fishing in the Jinjiao Mountains.

518
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,940
And the design of the old buildings in the new city.

519
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,940
I'm sure it's all for the Zhuangzhi family.

520
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,940
That's good.

521
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
He's loyal to you.

522
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,940
It's easier for you to get close to him.

523
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,940
But, Hai, I have to remind you.

524
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,940
If Pingjing Hou dies in the mansion,

525
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,940
you won't be able to escape from the Dali Temple.

526
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,940
We have to think of a way to keep it from being exposed.

527
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,940
Whether it's a death or an accident,

528
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,940
it can make you fall back.

529
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,940
It's not the way for people like us to survive.

530
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,940
Let's take a step at a time.

531
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
If you can kill him so easily,

532
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,940
you don't have to be so proud of me.

533
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,940
I have to go.

534
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,940
I just became a member of the staff.

535
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,940
I can't stay here for long.

536
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
I'll come to you if I need anything.

537
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
Okay.

538
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,940
Hai.

539
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,940
You're not the same as before.

540
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,940
Good and bad things will come to you.

541
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,940
Be careful.

542
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
Don't worry, master.

543
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,940
By the way, Hai.

544
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,940
This is the book you wanted.

545
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,940
Remember to pay the bill.

546
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
Master, you...

547
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,940
You have to do everything right.

548
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,940
Let's go.

549
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,940
Let's go.

550
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
Let's go.

551
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,940
Boss, a bowl of wonton and a plate of tofu skin.

552
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Okay, wait a minute.

553
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,940
The park.

554
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
Sir, I'm sorry.

555
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,940
I sold out the wonton.

556
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,940
Would you like to eat somewhere else?

557
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,940
Isn't there more?

558
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Yes.

559
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,940
I was reminded of this park.

560
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Okay, I'll go to another place.

561
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,940
I'm sorry.

562
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
There's no other place, sir.

563
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,940
I've already booked the next and the next one you go to.

564
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,940
Do I know you?

565
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
Don't misunderstand, sir.

566
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,940
I didn't mean to make things difficult for you.

567
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,940
My master has already prepared a banquet.

568
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,940
Please go, sir.

569
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
Who is your master?

570
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,940
The owner of the clinic.

571
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,940
My master also said that

572
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,940
you would come if you were wise and thoughtful.

573
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Lead the way.

574
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,940
Please, sir.

575
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,940
Please, sir.

576
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
I'll wait for you downstairs.

577
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,940
You're very famous.

578
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,940
I'm surprised to see you today.

579
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,940
I'm Xu Ben, the owner of this clinic.

580
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,940
I'm sorry to meet you today.

581
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,940
Please don't mind.

582
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,940
You don't have to be polite.

583
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,940
You're the one who's showing off.

584
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
You may not know,

585
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,940
but I have a relationship with the clinic.

586
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,940
The first day I arrived in Beijing,

587
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,940
I saw a good play at the clinic.

588
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,940
You're lying.

589
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,940
Please don't mind.

590
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Please, sir.

591
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
Please.

592
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
Sir, please try

593
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,940
the Shandong Qiu Bai

594
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,940
that the clinic has been teaching.

595
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Please, sir.

596
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
To you, Mr. Xu.

597
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,940
Please.

598
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,940
Good wine.

599
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,940
Please try.

600
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,940
This is the signature dish of the clinic.

601
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,940
You can't eat it

602
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,940
outside of Beijing.

603
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,940
You can't eat it

604
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,940
in the place you lived in before.

605
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
I wonder

606
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,940
why you called me here.

607
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,940
I just want to make friends

608
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,940
with you.

609
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
Thanks to your kindness,

610
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,940
you have royal jade and

611
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,940
wealth.

612
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,940
Would you need friends like me?

613
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,940
You just arrived in Beijing.

614
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
You're already so famous.

615
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,940
Money is all about profit.

616
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,940
You're famous.

617
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,940
You're afraid that you'll

618
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,940
be the one to take the initiative?

619
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,940
These are all

620
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,940
hand-me-down items.

621
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,940
They're all for you.

622
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,940
If you take them,

623
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,940
you'll be my friend.

624
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,940
Mr. Xu,

625
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,940
I've never seen

626
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,940
so many hand-me-downs

627
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,940
and jewels.

628
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
You're a servant in the Marquis's mansion.

629
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,940
You need money

630
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,940
to get in and out.

631
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
If you need anything,

632
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,940
just tell me.

633
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,940
I like to help friends.

634
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,940
Just a word from you,

635
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,940
and you'll be my friend.

636
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,940
Please.

637
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,940
You're kind.

638
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
I have a few requests.

639
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,940
Please consider them.

640
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,940
I'll do my best.

641
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,940
As I said,

642
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,940
when I first arrived in Beijing,

643
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,940
I watched a film.

644
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,940
I made a lot of money.

645
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,940
I was embarrassed.

646
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Luckily, this lady

647
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,940
helped me out.

648
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,940
Now I realize

649
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,940
the hand-me-down is

650
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,940
a good place.

651
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,940
Would you like to

652
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,940
make me a pig's head

653
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,940
and a lantern

654
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,940
on the 15th of every month?

655
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,940
Since you like it,

656
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,940
I'll make you a pig's head.

657
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,940
A lantern...

658
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,940
A lantern...

659
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,940
A lantern is a good idea.

660
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,940
You just arrived in Beijing,

661
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,940
and you want to make friends.

662
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,940
A pig's head is a good idea.

663
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,940
Thank you.

664
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,940
Please.

665
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,940
I have a request.

666
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,940
Please.

667
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,940
I'm ashamed.

668
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
Mr. Zhuang

669
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,940
has made a lot of money

670
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,940
in your clinic.

671
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,940
Some of them are from the Marquis.

672
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,940
I'm in charge of the stock.

673
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,940
I'm afraid that the Marquis

674
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,940
will ask me questions.

675
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,940
I don't know.

676
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,940
I want to get the treasures back.

677
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,940
But I can't afford it.

678
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,940
Mr. Xu,

679
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,940
can you think of a way to make up for it?

680
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,940
The treasures

681
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,940
you made before

682
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,940
are in the stock.

683
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,940
How about this?

684
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,940
I'll send someone to find

685
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,940
the owner of the stock.

686
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,940
I don't understand.

687
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,940
Mr. Xu,

688
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,940
you're a good man.

689
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,940
I'll drink this.

690
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,940
Please.

691
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,940
I'm sorry.

692
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,940
I'm sorry.

693
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,940
It seems that the Marquis

694
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,940
is not very kind.

695
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,940
We have to practice

696
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,940
the liquor well.

697
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,940
Yes, yes, yes.

698
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,940
Mr. Xu is right.

699
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,940
Mr. Xu,

700
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,940
I have a few things to do.

701
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,940
Enough.

702
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,940
Stop it.

703
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,940
You're not going to drink.

704
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,940
I'm not going to drink.

705
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,940
Stop acting.

706
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,940
He has figured it out.

707
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,940
How do you know

708
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,940
he's not the owner of the stock?

709
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,940
How can the owner

710
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,940
keep watching his subordinates?

711
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
He's just a pig.

712
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
He's just a lamp.

713
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,940
A lamp.

714
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,940
Your cup is worth a lot.

715
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,940
Mr. Xu

716
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
made many unreasonable demands

717
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,940
against me.

718
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,940
He's very strict

719
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,940
and he's very cautious.

720
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,940
He's also very good at

721
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,940
calculating.

722
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,940
If I'm not wrong,

723
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,940
he's the owner of the stock.

724
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,940
Mr. Zhang Fang.

725
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,940
I don't know if I should say

726
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,940
he's stupid or you're smart.

727
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,940
I can tell

728
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,940
because the owner wants me to.

729
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,940
Since the owner

730
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,940
is now showing his true self,

731
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,940
I don't think he's in a hurry.

732
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,940
He has something to tell me.

733
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,940
Let's go somewhere else.

734
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,940
I'm here.

735
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,940
I'm here.

736
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,940
I'm here.

737
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,940
I'm here.

738
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,940
I'm here.

739
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,940
I'm here.

740
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,940
I'm here.

741
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,940
I'm here.

742
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,940
I'm here.

743
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,940
I'm here.

744
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,940
I'm here.

745
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,940
I'm here.

746
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,940
I'm here.

747
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,940
I'm here.

748
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,940
I'm here.

749
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,940
I'm here.

750
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,940
I'm here.

751
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,940
I'm here.

752
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,940
