1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,280
I need your sleep

2
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,160
Crazy

3
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,520
Chief

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,400
You look anxious

5
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,360
You should be anxious

6
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,260
because of your husband

7
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,740
Today I went out and bought

8
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,920
I heard that

9
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,320
someone in the city

10
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,740
was discussing this

11
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,940
in the hall

12
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,860
But I did not see any

13
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,940
Von Landlanger

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Some even mentioned the Marquis.

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
What did they say?

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,600
They said that Zang Hai was bold and bold,

17
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,000
and that he was a man of the heart.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,600
They said that the Marquis was a servant.

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,400
The Marquis's house was a rule.

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,600
I'm afraid that the Marquis will find out.

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,200
I didn't care about these rumors.

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,200
But the matter of Tian Xiang is important.

23
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,200
I'm afraid that if these rumors continue,

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
if one day it gets to His Majesty,

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,400
he will be punished.

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm afraid that if he doesn't,

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,600
he will be punished.

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,000
I think that

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,600
no matter what Zang Hai says,

30
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
he dared to cross the Marquis today and take revenge.

31
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Tomorrow, he might do something.

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Such a person can't stay by his side.

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,000
What do you mean?

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
If you can't bear to do it,

35
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I can do it for you.

36
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
It's easy to kill him.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,800
But what if he defends Tian Xiang?

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
If he defends Tian Xiang,

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,800
if he defends him, it means that the Marquis will be blind.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Although he's a rare talent,

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,800
if he doesn't listen, he should be killed.

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Tell me.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,800
Will that about to fall down general,

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
be me?

45
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,600
Marquis,

46
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,800
you really believe what he said?

47
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,600
It's raining heavily! The rain is pouring!

48
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,800
The storm is coming!

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,200
It's raining heavily! The rain is pouring!

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,200
The storm is coming!

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,800
By the will of the Heaven,

52
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
I hereby decree that

53
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
the Great Han of Zhongzhou,

54
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
for the past month,

55
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,600
will be united with the river,

56
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,000
and will surround the heart of the people.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,200
Today, the sky is falling,

58
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
the clouds are flying,

59
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,400
the people are in a slumber,

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
and the sky is clear.

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,200
The sky is clear, the rain is pouring.

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,800
I hereby grant you a thousand taels of silver.

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,200
I, Chu Huai Ming, thank you, Your Majesty.

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Everyone, we must continue to work hard.

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
We must not let His Majesty down.

66
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Go back to work!

68
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,600
How's Zang Hai these days?

69
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,800
I heard that he eats well, drinks well, and sleeps well.

70
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
He sits and keeps his eyes closed.

71
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
He's just like a normal person.

72
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Go now.

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Yes.

74
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
music

75
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,400
Lord Chu

76
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,560
You'll be awake in a few days

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,440
You should wake up and get up

78
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,320
You should get married

79
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,280
The news from Zhongzhou

80
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,080
The heaven is on the verge of collapse

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,400
I won, you lost

82
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,760
Why are you in a hurry?

83
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,800
You gave me seven days

84
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
What's the use of ten days?

85
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you think you have a chance to survive?

86
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,200
A man of good intentions will always have good intentions

87
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
You memorized these two sentences well

88
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,760
But you haven't heard the other one, right?

89
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,720
The moon is out of the wall, the brush is fat

90
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,960
As a witness of the Qingtian Sword

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,160
you are not good at learning

92
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,600
You only know to reward and ignore the facts

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,120
You can't even understand this

94
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,200
Stop talking nonsense

95
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,640
I'm concerned about the situation in the Qingtian Sword

96
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,600
I don't care about the facts

97
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,160
If you don't believe me, please go back

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,440
You are impatient

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
You should wait for five more days

100
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm so worried

101
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,840
You've been working hard for years

102
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,080
You are so worried

103
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,800
You are so worried

104
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,080
I don't want to talk to you

105
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,160
Just wait

106
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,000
娘

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,480
Is my dad totally ok?

108
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,080
Are you ok?

109
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,360
What's wrong?

110
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,000
Last night, my dad asked for mergers

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,560
to finish the performance

112
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
by the lead abdication

113
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,800
It opened the door

114
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,280
I was in a critical situation at that time.

115
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,920
If I hadn't said it so seriously,

116
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm afraid that the Marquis would have killed me on the spot.

117
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
So I thought of these words

118
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,440
in a hurry.

119
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Marquis Jiangjiang died every year.

120
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
There are strange events every year.

121
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,280
I only said that the general's heart was down.

122
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,440
I didn't say the exact size of the official position.

123
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,760
As long as I can coax the Marquis, it's okay.

124
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,720
If my father knew that you lied to him,

125
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,320
he would have killed you

126
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,640
with such a heavy heart.

127
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
I just need to wait a few more days

128
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,960
to prove to him that I'm right.

129
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,720
Mr. Cheng,

130
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,480
can you help me

131
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,120
to send the message from your father's old department

132
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,040
to help the soldiers in Zhongzhou?

133
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,280
Okay.

134
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
There's one more thing

135
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,400
that needs your help.

136
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,800
Keep a close watch on it.

137
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,960
No one is allowed to carry the soldiers inside.

138
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,960
My Lord,

139
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,440
it has been raining for three days in Zhongzhou.

140
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,240
The drought is getting worse.

141
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,600
Everything is unstable.

142
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
It's been raining for three days.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,040
How's the rain?

144
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,280
It seems to be not slow.

145
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,400
Next, you'll go to the Ministry of Works

146
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,000
to ask the Water and Temperature Bureau about the rain in Zhongzhou.

147
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,840
My Lord,

148
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,880
the drought in Zhongzhou has been raining for four days.

149
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,840
The rain is the biggest in ten years.

150
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,760
There's also a flood

151
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,920
at the low point of the ground.

152
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,360
Go.

153
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,520
Go.

154
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,560
The drought in Zhongzhou has been raining for five days.

155
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,240
The river is full of rain and the rain is heavy.

156
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,400
The salt and iron in the mountains are falling.

157
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,720
It has damaged more than a hundred houses and injured hundreds of people.

158
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,680
Report again.

159
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,080
The drought in Zhongzhou has been raining for sixty days.

160
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,520
The water level in the river is getting higher

161
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,480
and the dam is being built.

162
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,960
If we don't stop for a few days,

163
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,280
there will be a final blow.

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,800
Impossible.

165
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,600
Impossible.

166
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,320
Mr. Chu.

167
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,520
Mr. Zhang,

168
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,480
please help me to inform them.

169
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,960
I want to see the Marquis.

170
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
He has been unwell these days.

171
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,960
He has ordered all the guests to leave.

172
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,560
Mr. Chu, please go back.

173
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,480
Why?

174
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Why?

175
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,400
Why),

176
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,240
Why can't we set it on fire?

177
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
It's dangerous.

178
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,640
The Marquis

179
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,160
will be believed right away.

180
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,760
This is how he is.

181
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,360
If we stay here and make a mess,

182
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,120
he won't get heard.

183
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,960
That's because

184
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,920
Eunuch, what do you mean?

185
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,520
What you mean is

186
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,960
Lord Chu should ask for punishment from His Majesty as soon as possible.

187
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,200
You're not going to save me?

188
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,400
You can't leave me alone.

189
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,800
You said that the rain won't stop in Zhongzhou.

190
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,360
His Majesty can't sleep at night.

191
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,240
He can't eat for days.

192
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,920
Lord Chu, you're a man of conscience.

193
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,440
You're a man of the country.

194
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,840
You should be careful.

195
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,520
Sir, it doesn't matter.

196
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,640
continuing to stateaped

197
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
cancellation.

198
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:40,520
No...

199
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,440
Yifu, he's left.

200
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
This Thusian isnoch peac Complained

201
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,420
You don't like it,

202
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,320
unya.

203
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:59,220
Where's thinking of taking advantage of

204
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,080
Lishan.

205
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,260
Officer Chu came.

206
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,120
Zeng,

207
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,920
you are so jelous.

208
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
It's been raining for days

209
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,120
The rain is heavy

210
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,840
Brother Zang Hai

211
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,080
You are the lord's subordinate

212
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,160
I'm also working for the lord

213
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
We are in the same boat

214
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,040
There's no need to fight

215
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,160
If you want to be an official

216
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,920
I'll go to the lord and say a few words

217
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,840
No problem

218
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
If you want money

219
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,360
I'll help you

220
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,960
How much do you want

221
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,040
Open a store

222
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,920
Brother Zang Hai

223
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,600
Brother Zang Hai

224
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
As long as you tell the lord

225
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,240
This time the star is

226
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,880
the chest of the heart

227
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,760
I guessed the chest

228
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,240
You guessed the chest

229
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,200
None of us guessed wrong

230
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,680
Just didn't guess it all

231
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,040
In this case

232
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm at most a hostage

233
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,600
You also saved your life

234
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,200
Two thousand qimei

235
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,360
What do you think

236
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,400
I think it's crazy

237
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,040
Brother Zang has been able to enter the house

238
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,080
lonely

239
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,480
From Zhu Daren

240
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,440
Are you прямоing me

241
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,480
ogh

242
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,080
You are really far astray

243
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,240
It's good to be mistaken

244
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,200
Brother Zang

245
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,720
I invited you to marquis house

246
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,680
and give me a title

247
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
I will use my land

248
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,880
to fight against the enemy

249
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
and die with no mercy

250
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,080
To be honest, Lord Chu

251
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,720
I really feel sorry for

252
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,440
all the conditions you mentioned

253
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,240
Yes

254
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,720
Then we will give you a title

255
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,920
But right is right

256
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,280
and wrong is wrong

257
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,320
If all the right and wrong

258
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,520
and good and evil

259
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,280
can be combined

260
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,720
it will be a waste of

261
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,080
my parents' teachings

262
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,680
and the law of the imperial court

263
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,680
Yes

264
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,280
It's nice to see

265
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,460
you help us

266
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,280
but I am afraid

267
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,480
among our army

268
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,360
I am nobody

269
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,140
I only see

270
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,160
two Readymen

271
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,280
One is gonna come

272
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,040
when I rise

273
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,200
Their banner響

274
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,760
When I rise

275
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,520
he will love me

276
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,680
dare not

277
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,720
and take the place of Mr. Feng Shui

278
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,800
and the soldiers who died in the late emperor's tomb

279
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,720
and the young girls who were buried alive

280
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,280
Those people you killed for climbing up

281
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,600
and killing without mercy

282
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,200
are not your fault

283
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,040
Mr. Chu

284
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
You are the witness of the Qingtian Sword

285
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,560
You should know that

286
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,320
the law of nature can be returned

287
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
and the cause and effect can be repaid

288
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,800
Last time, Mr. Chu came here

289
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,400
to ask me for a favor

290
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
But this time

291
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,600
he asked me to plead for you

292
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,320
or to say goodbye to me

293
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,080
You are right

294
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,680
But today is your death day

295
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,880
Did you get it?

296
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,240
Chu Bailing

297
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,160
You are the most capable man

298
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
in the world

299
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,960
You can be a man again

300
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,480
after a few years of prison

301
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,520
If you kill someone

302
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,760
you will die

303
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
I will die if I kill someone

304
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,480
You killed Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao

305
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,320
You should die, too

306
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,800
I will leave the capital if I kill you

307
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,720
I will never find you again

308
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,120
You are capable

309
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
but you can't escape death

310
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,560
I entered the Qingtian Sword when I was 15

311
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,720
I was so quiet

312
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,000
I spent so many years

313
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,160
I spent so much time and effort

314
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,760
to get the notice of Pingting Marquis

315
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,000
and become the Sword Master of Qingtian Sword

316
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,760
Do you know

317
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,120
how much effort I have put into

318
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,880
to get to this step

319
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,400
and how much I have suffered?

320
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,840
You

321
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,280
are the reason for my death

322
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,560
You made me

323
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,320
lose everything

324
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,400
You became the Sword Master of Qingtian Sword

325
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,520
but you have forgotten your true nature

326
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,120
You are not the one who hurt me

327
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,360
but yourself

328
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,920
What's wrong with me?

329
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,240
Am I wrong?

330
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,440
Nothing would happen without you

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
I, Chu Huai Ming

332
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
even if I have to die

333
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,200
I will push you down

334
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,240
Chu Huai Ming, you

335
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,120
You are dead

336
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,920
I am so proud of you

337
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,720
You are the master of Qingtian Sword

338
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,360
Continue it

339
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Dude, how many times have I told you

340
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,600
to give you a good lesson?

341
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,280
Stopstick

342
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,480
It isn't easy for you

343
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,800
to dünype

344
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,120
afterHe practices life

345
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,560
Stay away from him

346
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,120
Stay away from the one he represents

347
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,960
Not only that

348
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,280
you will not get what you want

349
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,320
I, Chu Huai Ming

350
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,560
will make good use of it

351
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,800
tomb

352
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,600
Sir

Come on

354
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Come on

355
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,360
What's this smell?

356
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,160
Go and have a look

357
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,560
Come on

358
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Water is coming

359
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Water is coming

360
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Go and save them

361
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,360
Hurry up

362
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,960
I'm here

363
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,160
Save me, hurry up

364
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Come on

365
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,960
Water is coming

366
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Water is coming

367
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,160
Hurry up

368
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Hurry up

369
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Hurry up

370
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Hurry up

371
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Hurry up

372
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Hurry up

373
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Hurry up

374
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Hurry up

375
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
There's one more thing

376
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
I need your help

377
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
I've cut off all the ways

378
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,560
to kill Chu Huai Ming

379
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
I'm afraid he wants to kill me

380
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
to set fire

381
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Then you must follow the plan

382
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
and don't come to save me

383
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
My Lord

384
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
I'm afraid I can't save you

385
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
My Lord

386
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,560
The rain in Zhongzhou is getting heavier

387
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
I can't stop it

388
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
I'm afraid there's a flood

389
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Today is the seventh day of the rain

390
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,560
Seventh day?

391
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
My Lord, bad news!

392
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
My Lord, bad news!

393
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
What's wrong?

394
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
The old house is flooded

395
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Where's Sang Hai?

396
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
He's still inside

397
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
The servants have gone to rescue him

398
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Young Master

399
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
Lord Chu

400
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
Why are you in such a hurry?

401
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I just visited the Marquis

402
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
I'll leave now

403
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
You killed people and set fire to the Marquis' mansion

404
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
and you're still running away?

405
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
You

406
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Go to see the Marquis

407
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Go

408
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Go

409
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
My Lord

410
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Sang Hai

411
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
My Lord

412
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
My Lord

413
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
My Lord

414
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Be careful, My Lord

415
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
My Lord

416
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
Help

417
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
My Lord

418
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Help

419
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Help

420
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
My Lord, are you okay?

421
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Set fire

422
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Okay

423
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Hurry up

424
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Fire

425
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Fire

426
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Hurry up

427
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Fire

428
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Step aside

429
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
My Lord

430
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
My Lord

431
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
My Lord

432
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
My Lord

433
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Are you okay?

434
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
I'm fine

435
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
My Lord

436
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
My Lord

437
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
My Lord

438
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
My Lord

439
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
My Lord

440
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
How could you ...

441
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
You're lucky today

442
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Why did you set fire to a good house?

443
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
The soldiers said

444
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Lord Chu was here before the fire

445
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Chu Huai Ming?

446
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Where is he?

447
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Father

448
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Look

449
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Father

450
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,700
Until that time

451
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,680
I still couldn't escape

452
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:57,600
So I took become a

453
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,400
My lord

454
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,400
His gun is aimed at you, my lord

455
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,400
My lord

456
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,280
My lord

457
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,080
There are some reports from Zhongzhou

458
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,200
The rain is heavy

459
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,560
Most of the dams were destroyed

460
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,640
The river water is flooded

461
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,600
The downstream oil was flooded

462
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,840
It's cold for tens of thousands of meters

463
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,880
What about the people of Zhongzhou?

464
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,760
The people of Yan'an were warned in advance

465
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,160
They have withdrawn a lot

466
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,960
But the damage is still unprecedented

467
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,560
Another thing

468
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,280
The commander of the army, General Fu Zhisong

469
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,240
He took the army to prevent the disaster

470
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,000
When the dam was destroyed

471
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,440
General Fu was also involved in the big wave

472
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,440
The body has been found downstream

473
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,960
Chu Anming, escort him to the Dali Temple

474
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,520
Get up

475
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,320
My lord

476
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,680
Zang Hai

477
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,440
You can't die

478
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,680
You can't die

479
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,560
Go fetch water

480
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,160
Hurry up

481
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,760
Hurry up

482
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,560
Hurry up

483
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,560
You mean

484
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,960
the Marquis went into the fire

485
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,320
to save Zang Hai?

486
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,840
Fortunately, the murderer of the fire was caught

487
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Who set the fire?

488
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Chu Anming

489
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,760
The second young master caught Lord Chu

490
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Now he is going to Dali Temple in person

491
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,760
Fu'er, hurry up

492
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Go see your father

493
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,480
Okay

494
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,720
Madam, don't worry

495
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Lord Zang has sent the Marquis back to the house

496
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,280
Marquis ordered

497
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,760
you and the young master

498
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,320
not to go there

499
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,960
Yes

500
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,160
Fu'er

501
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,000
We were captured by the Tartars

502
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,400
You should be the one

503
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
guarding your father

504
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,880
You could of at best

505
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,800
just call the gallows

506
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:51,340
or use the

507
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,420
Marquis' baton

508
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,580
I lost a great general in the battle of Danyong.

509
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:02,020
To be honest, I'm quite relieved.

510
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,460
I've been thinking these past days

511
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,900
if I'm the one who's the general.

512
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,460
My Lord, you're overthinking.

513
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,660
I once told you that you're a lucky man.

514
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,060
I've been fighting in the battlefield for decades.

515
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
I've never been afraid of death.

516
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,940
But after I've been in the capital for a long time,

517
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,140
my heart is different from before.

518
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,860
It's good that I have you

519
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,100
to help me with my plan.

520
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,340
My Lord, I'm not a good man.

521
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,180
I'm afraid that you can't see it

522
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,860
and you can't make plans for the Marquis' Mansion.

523
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,180
If you hadn't helped me today,

524
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,380
I'm afraid that I would have died in the fire.

525
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,140
Zi Hai, I've always treated you as a friend.

526
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,900
You're a soldier and a general.

527
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,260
But since you came to the battlefield today,

528
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,580
I've been worried about you.

529
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,860
I've been worried about you.

530
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,700
But since you came to the battlefield today,

531
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,660
I've realized that

532
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,580
I've already thought of you as my family.

533
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,660
I've been treating you like this before.

534
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,260
It's all because of my love for you.

535
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,220
Don't blame me.

536
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,420
I don't dare to.

537
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,700
It's all my fault for being the one who's the general.

538
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,500
Enough.

539
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,700
You're also thinking for me.

540
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,260
I can understand what you're saying.

541
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,100
But I can't give up my trust.

542
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,260
You can also promise me that

543
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,340
you would never let her down.

544
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,420
I made an environment of the High Priestess.

545
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,860
It's difficult for me to trust someone.

546
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,420
Don't fail me.

547
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,900
I will never let you down.

548
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,260
Tight- Втор respects Condut Aaron Chu

549
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,820
May His Majesty have mercy

550
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:32,800
The boil is growing, banks are ise

551
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,920
This battle

552
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,940
Their pictures are safe

553
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,140
Commandant, this is for quiIing you

554
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,380
I robed douches and peopIes

555
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,660
What?

556
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,500
Lady Fortress

557
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,220
I am so detzt

558
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,640
My eyes cinco shiIPer

559
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,300
you can't whiten my eyes

560
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,700
You're weII

561
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,900
WeIcome

562
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,860
And I

563
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,220
are not weII

564
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,580
Thank you for your manufacturers' drink

565
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,580
Rest in protection

566
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,180
Yes

567
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,480
Can I have a 적et

568
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm thinking about Zang Hai and Zhuang Zhixing

569
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,800
Mistress, what do you want them to do?

570
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
In case they get tired of it

571
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,600
It's because Immortal Xing showed his face in the game

572
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,080
and got the lord's favor

573
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,160
The governor heard about it and he was happy

574
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,080
He allowed lord to think about it

575
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,280
He wanted a son who could inherit Zhuang's family's business

576
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,640
and get the glory of martial arts

577
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,320
But he happened to

578
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,720
catch Chu Huai Ming who set the fire

579
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
He not only made the contribution

580
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,200
but also helped Zang Hai

581
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,680
This step is accurate and precise

582
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,360
It's all in the past

583
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,080
Did the second young master tell them to do it?

584
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,320
I'm worried that he and Zang Hai...

585
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,480
Although I don't know what Zang Hai's purpose is

586
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:42,920
I'm sure he wants to fight against my father

587
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,360
That's not a big deal

588
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,120
Young Master is not as useless as him

589
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,480
Lord, what are you going to do?

590
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,200
Article 1

591
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,680
Ela1

592
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,280
大师

593
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,560
Is it hard to come up with an alternative?

594
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,600
I'm seasoning Got it

595
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,280
Young Master, I want to talk with you

596
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,640
Yes

597
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,760
Make yourself at home

598
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,920
In what way?

599
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,520
How is your wound?

600
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,560
You didn't let me take care of you last night

601
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,640
I was worried about you all night

602
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,440
It's nothing serious

603
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,840
Your Lordship's safety

604
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,800
concerns the life of all the people in the mansion

605
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,920
I don't mind

606
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,160
I hope you won't do such a thing again

607
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,000
You are so generous

608
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,440
It's the only mansion in the mansion

609
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,000
But I don't know why

610
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,000
I can't calm down

611
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,200
What's the matter?

612
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,320
Since Zang Hai came into the mansion

613
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,120
there are fewer and fewer people

614
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,240
to be used by you

615
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,400
First, Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao

616
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,080
Now even Chu Huai Ming is in prison

617
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,720
Think about it

618
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,160
Who is the most proud person

619
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,920
in this mansion?

620
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,560
Isn't it Zang Hai?

621
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,800
You treat him with all your heart

622
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,720
But why does he do

623
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,680
something that is out of the question?

624
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,760
Out of the question?

625
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,920
Madam, do you think so?

626
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,360
Zang Hai came into the mansion

627
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,520
and got close to Zhixing

628
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,280
I'm afraid he saw

629
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
Zhixing is a simple girl

630
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,880
who likes to make friends

631
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,080
Yesterday, Chu Huai Ming was captured by Zhixing

632
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,040
Why is it so coincidental?

633
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,160
You mean

634
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,520
Zhixing knew that Chu Huai Ming was on the loose

635
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,240
and waited there?

636
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,920
I'm afraid there are some masters behind it

637
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,440
Otherwise, how could he

638
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,760
have won the championship without playing?

639
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,600
Madam, you're the head of the mansion

640
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,800
You should be honored to be in the mansion

641
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,440
Why can't you be honored

642
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,560
when Zhixing is in the mansion?

643
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,720
You misunderstood me

644
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,840
I'm just worried

645
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,480
You treated him with good manners

646
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,360
But it's not that I don't like you

647
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,800
I understand what you mean

648
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
You may leave

649
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,880
After mom goes back

650
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,200
The two of you

651
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,520
will continue to stand on their own two feet

652
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,200
I want Zhixing to bear children

653
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,640
for his mother

654
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,200
What a great menze

655
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,680
I realized it

656
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,080
but it'll get against my hose

657
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,920
So you can't help me

658
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,920
I'll make that myself

659
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,800
If you don't tell me

660
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,240
about my wife

661
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
My Lord

662
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
Did you hear what I said?

663
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
My Lord

664
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
I did

665
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,680
Is there anything you want to say?

666
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,880
You are right

667
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,880
I did

668
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,560
let you win the competition

669
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,280
But I didn't expect

670
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,800
Chu Huai Ming would come to kill me

671
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,240
Yesterday, everyone

672
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,880
came here to kill me

673
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,680
After Chu Huai Ming set the fire

674
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,240
Cang Huang must have run away

675
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,480
When the second young master met him

676
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,920
he wanted to catch him

677
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,920
But I admit

678
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,320
I did get closer to the second young master

679
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
My Lord

680
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
I have to say

681
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,480
The second young master is talented

682
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,520
If he only lost the competition

683
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,520
it's not enough

684
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,320
You mean

685
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
you want to let Zhixing join the army?

686
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
Yes

687
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
You are a talented man

688
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,240
You are the pillar of the court

689
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,120
But the Zhuang family has been fighting in the battlefield

690
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,720
and you have made a great contribution

691
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,400
If there is no one after you

692
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,880
I feel sorry for you

693
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,440
You should comes down

694
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,480
Zhifu is no fighter

695
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,600
But Zhixing

696
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
Iそ you are mistaken

697
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,960
The second young master

698
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,400
was indeed hesitating

699
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,160
can be out of the shadow so quickly

700
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,040
Except for your own efforts

701
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,160
You can rely on the blood of the Zhuang family

702
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,000
flowing on your body

703
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,520
You are planning the future now

704
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,480
Will it be earlier?

705
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,200
I am the family minister of the Marquis

706
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,880
I will plan for the future of the Marquis Mansion

707
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,320
If the Marquis Mansion can have a position

708
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,960
and a position in the court

709
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,360
Then the future business will be more stable

710
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,000
You think more than I do

711
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,120
Marquis said to me

712
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,040
he would treat me as a family

713
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,800
So I will tell you

714
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,600
all my feelings

715
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,000
I had no one like you

716
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,800
around me

717
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,120
But they are all dead

718
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,000
They died for me

719
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,400
Are you afraid of death?

720
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,720
Marquis

721
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,120
I once said I am afraid of death

722
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,680
I am afraid life and death are come in vain

723
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,400
Maybe those who followed you

724
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,880
you burned to thin flick

725
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,840
I have something to tell you

726
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,680
There was a man

727
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,520
I've got the position of the spy of the New Heaven Sword.

728
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,000
Tell me,

729
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,640
do you want to take this job?

730
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,000
I...

731
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,120
No need to hesitate.

732
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,480
If you want to,

733
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,200
I'll follow your order.

734
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,920
I'll do as you say.

735
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,960
My disciple,

736
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,160
you're really lucky this time.

737
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,000
How much trust do you think you've gained

738
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,480
after the Pingjing War?

739
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Ten to seven.

740
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,360
Master doesn't think so.

741
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,480
If the person in the fire field is not you,

742
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,560
but Jiang Xiang,

743
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,880
he won't save her.

744
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,080
Jiang Xiang's father, Jiang Jin,

745
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,200
is no longer the Minister of Rites.

746
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,120
He's no longer valuable to her.

747
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,400
And you're the most precious member of her.

748
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,560
Your talent and ability

749
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,280
are a tool to help the court.

750
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,720
She saved you

751
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,040
to save her own private property.

752
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,560
As for what she said to you,

753
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
she just wanted to buy your heart.

754
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,600
Now it seems that

755
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,080
it's a good thing that the Pingjing Marquis is willing to be your friend.

756
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,560
But you should pay more attention to the scale.

757
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,320
One more is more than one.

758
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,960
One less is more than one.

759
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,920
It's hard to make a difference.

760
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,760
I hope you can be the most trusted

761
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,000
and most dependent person around her.

762
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,760
Pingjing Marquis will be

763
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,360
loyal to you.

764
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,880
I'm not close to her.

765
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,800
I can make her trust me.

766
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,800
But if she wants to rely on me,

767
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,280
she hasn't been with me for ten years.

768
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,480
How could she do that?

769
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,080
Even Yang Zhen can't do that.

770
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,800
Everyone has their own pain and confusion.

771
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,240
If you want to do something difficult,

772
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,000
Pingjing Marquis is no exception.

773
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,560
If you want to gain her dependence on you,

774
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,200
you have to help her out of her troubles.

775
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,440
What's Pingjing Marquis' pain?

776
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,480
It's about the person

777
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,440
who has disappeared from the Zhuang family.

778
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,840
I'm sorry.

779
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,720
