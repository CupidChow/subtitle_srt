00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 14

2
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,280
The things are here, Miss.

3
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,680
Where is Master Gao Ming?

4
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,880
He went to buy the horses.

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,640
We have so many people and luggage.

6
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,240
We can't even buy a car.

7
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,160
I've already returned the spirit of the demon and the thief.

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
I've also given them some silver.

9
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,240
Mr. Zhang, you won't mind, right?

10
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,320
Who else in the whole capital

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,160
can make more money than Boss Xiang?

12
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,160
In the future, we all

13
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,920
will have to raise you.

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,680
Xiao Hai. Xiao Hai.

15
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
Who are you?

16
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,240
Mr. Zhao.

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Eunuch.

18
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Zhang Haiyang.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Zhang Haiyang.

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,840
Are you going to leave the capital

21
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,600
and go to the capital?

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
I've already left the capital.

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,880
I'm thinking of telling you

24
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,960
when His Majesty is ready.

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,920
Do you have time

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,120
to talk to me?

27
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,680
Don't say that.

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,240
I've already asked Mr. Zhang

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,760
to leave the capital.

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,680
Right?

31
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,120
You have a car.

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,680
You can go left.

33
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,320
Or turn right.

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,280
What?

35
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,520
It seems that there is a choice.

36
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
In fact,

37
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,120
there is no one.

38
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,120
I saved you that year.

39
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,720
I asked you to follow the heart's choice.

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,720
You chose to revenge.

41
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,120
But I've been thinking about it all these years.

42
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,320
Let a child

43
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,720
make such a cruel choice.

44
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Is that true?

45
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
I saved you and gave you great grace.

46
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
You asked the teachers to take care of me

47
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
and let me revenge for my hatred.

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
How could I blame you?

49
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Yes.

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
You've grown up

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,720
and have a good heart.

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Now,

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
your third enemy is dead.

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I've started a new life.

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I want you to choose again.

56
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Are you okay?

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Let's go.

58
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Let's go.

59
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Let's go.

60
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Thank you.

61
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
Thank you.

62
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,880
Thank you.

63
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Thank you.

64
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
Thank you.

65
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
Thank you.

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,120
Take it for them.

67
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,440
Thank you, sir.

68
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,600
Thank you, sir.

69
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,520
Thank you, sir.

70
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,240
Thank you, sir.

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Thank you.

72
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,520
For so many years,

73
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,000
the coal power has been used up.

74
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,840
It's a year-long exchange of coal.

75
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,760
Most of it is broke down.

76
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,920
In this house,

77
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,280
theimate childat

78
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
bit off his oldu.

79
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,160
What do you say

80
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,080
as the USA addition?

81
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,760
I remember when you

82
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,240
joined the

83
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,920
heilae packet,

84
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,120
your father

85
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
used to do it like this,

86
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,840
He would also let some people in the palace

87
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,840
at least let them have a meal.

88
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Your many brothers are the orphans of the Taonan.

89
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
They are as filial as the Wuyi.

90
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,840
They were raised by him in his home.

91
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,840
But it's just a matter of time.

92
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,840
That time, you went to my home to test

93
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
and you still remember what I said to you?

94
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Before you realize what you want to do,

95
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,840
you must go to that position before you realize it.

96
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
What you mean is...

97
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Your father could save them for a lifetime.

98
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Why can't you go even further?

99
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,840
To save the world from the world?

100
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,840
From tomorrow, I will take over the Inner Council.

101
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,840
And you will be the main judge of the world.

102
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
If you want to,

103
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,840
you will be the special judge of the Inner Council.

104
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,840
You will continue to be the judge in the court.

105
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,840
If you want to go to the high seas,

106
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
you can go there.

107
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,840
But you can't live a life that you want.

108
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Let's go.

109
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,840
An Tu, I have an idea.

110
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
What is it?

111
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
The assassin.

112
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,840
He told everyone to leave the capital and not come back.

113
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,840
If the third person is still alive,

114
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
he knows who I am.

115
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,840
He also knows I know Gui Xi and Tong Yu.

116
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Tell me, will he let me go and let me leave?

117
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,840
He will let you stay in the place he sees.

118
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
He will try to make sure

119
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
if you will hand Gui Xi and Tong Yu over to His Majesty.

120
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,840
He will make sure you won't ruin his next plan.

121
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Even when it's necessary, he will kill you.

122
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
That's right.

123
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
The one who doesn't want us to leave

124
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,840
may be the real third person.

125
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
He wants to see me stay in the capital

126
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,840
and help him out.

127
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,840
Now, he is the only one who can save me.

128
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
If he is just a talent,

129
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
what a coincidence.

130
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
No matter what, I will try my best.

131
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
I will do my best.

132
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,840
No matter what, I will do my best.

133
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,840
This time, I can't just stay with Zhao Xi.

134
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,840
I can also get along with other people.

135
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
But it's him.

136
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
I am not him.

137
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
I will always seek the truth.

138
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
I will always seek the truth.

139
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
Master,

140
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
please keep an eye on him.

141
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Even if Zhao Bing Wen may be the third person,

142
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Master Gao Ming,

143
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
we will suspect him.

144
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
If Eunuch Chen is the third person,

145
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
I am wondering

146
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,840
if Master is the same as me and he is also killed.

147
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,840
But their relationship is always true.

148
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
No matter if it's Eunuch Chen or Master,

149
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
I can't be honest

150
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
before everything falls into place.

151
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Don't worry.

152
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
I know what to do.

153
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
I will do my best.

154
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Why is the word Zhong Yong so hard to write?

155
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Master taught me

156
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Zhong Yong is too much.

157
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
It's not easy to write.

158
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
It's the same as writing.

159
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,840
The reason why a gentleman can call a man Zhong Yong

160
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
is because he has a man's virtue.

161
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Wang Xiao Le said

162
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
it's the virtue of a good man.

163
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Wang Da Le said

164
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
it's the old man's virtue.

165
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
So you asked Zhang Han to enter the cabinet

166
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
and follow your instruction to the court

167
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
to serve the people.

168
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
It's just

169
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
that Zhang Han is young

170
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
and it's not his specialty.

171
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Do you mean this

172
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,840
or do you mean Zhang Hai?

173
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
He is very concerned about you.

174
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
It's just my idea.

175
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
You have nothing to hide, right?

176
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
I dare not.

177
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
You

178
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
still have to be a good teacher.

179
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Don't let the past

180
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
be a repeat of the past.

181
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Haven't you heard about the sunset in Tongyu?

182
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
My disciple is very thoughtful.

183
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
He is still a good teacher.

184
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
If you don't investigate it,

185
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm done.

186
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
I did it for his own good.

187
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Let him stay in the capital

188
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
and enter the cabinet

189
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
to protect him.

190
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
I will do it soon.

191
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Zhao Ge Lang.

192
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Zhao Ge Lang.

193
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Your Majesty,

194
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
I am here

195
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
to take care of the manor.

196
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
In the future,

197
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
I will help you

198
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
to raise the people

199
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
in the cabinet.

200
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
I will do my best.

201
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I will do my best.

202
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
It's a great pity that the government

203
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
is in a difficult position.

204
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
The ten departments

205
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
have been involved in the war.

206
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I hope you can

207
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
take care of the rest.

208
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
In the cabinet,

209
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
you will do everything

210
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
as best as you can.

211
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Yes.

212
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Your Majesty,

213
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
you have already approved

214
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
that Zhang Hai will enter the cabinet.

215
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
In the future,

216
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
you can attend

217
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
the imperial court's critical affairs.

218
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Zhang Hai,

219
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
in the future,

220
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
you can

221
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
enter the cabinet as you please.

222
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

223
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
All right.

224
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
Get ready

225
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
for the ceremony today.

226
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Zhang Hai.

227
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,840
If you don't know anything,

228
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
you can ask me anytime.

229
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
We don't have to

230
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
be in a hurry.

231
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Yes.

232
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Mr. Zhao.

233
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
I have something to do.

234
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Please call me.

235
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
I recently transferred

236
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
the votes of many years ago.

237
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
I found that

238
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
many people

239
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
have been the first to vote for Mr. Zhao.

240
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
I can see

241
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
that he is a very high-ranking

242
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,840
and a very good-natured person.

243
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
According to you,

244
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
he is not only a good-natured person,

245
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,840
but also a good-natured person

246
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
who is more prominent

247
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
and a good-natured person.

248
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,840
Can we really misunderstand him?

249
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
I don't know now.

250
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
He wants to train me

251
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
or to get rid of

252
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
the same kind of low-ranking in my hands.

253
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
It must be for a deeper purpose

254
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
to keep him from acting

255
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
for ten years.

256
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Before we can

257
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
achieve what we want,

258
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
we must go to that position first.

259
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
We must continue to investigate.

260
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
The next one is to be patient.

261
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
I said it para pretender.

262
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Individually it should be

263
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
mm-hmm

264
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
to understand

265
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:26,840
it best follows

266
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
I bought you some fragrant powder.

267
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Not bad.

268
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
I like it. Take it all.

269
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
You're a bit sincere.

270
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
How is your relationship with Zang?

271
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
He just joined the family.

272
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
He's been busy with the court every day.

273
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
He can't meet his people.

274
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
I said it.

275
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
It's not like he can't meet Zang.

276
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
He's a good guy.

277
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
So he can't meet Zang.

278
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
That's why he thinks of me.

279
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
This painting...

280
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Do you know the painting called Yushan Wind and Light?

281
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
This painting is from my father.

282
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,840
I've seen it since I was a kid.

283
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
How could I not recognize it?

284
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
It's this one.

285
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
That's right.

286
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Why is this painting here?

287
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
It's in the house of Shiyi Ping.

288
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
After he died,

289
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Zang Hai came to the emperor.

290
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
My father's painting...

291
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Why is it in Shiyi Ping's hand?

292
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Forget it.

293
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
I don't care.

294
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
But Zang Hai is kind of generous.

295
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
He specially gave you this winter flower.

296
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
To save the time.

297
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
That's right.

298
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
He didn't have time to accompany me.

299
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
It's right to give him a painting.

300
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Enough.

301
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
Don't stay in the house all day.

302
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Go.

303
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Go out and play with me.

304
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Mr. Zhao.

305
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,840
I have a question.

306
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
I hope you can give me a point.

307
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
The memorial books published in the Ministry of Justice

308
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
and the opinions of the cabinet voted by you

309
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
are all unspoken.

310
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,840
At present, the political Spring Festival is full of water and change.

311
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,840
The Ministry of Justice is very powerful.

312
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
If you want to fix the water power,

313
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
why...

314
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Zang Hai.

315
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
These years,

316
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,840
the Yong State treasury is empty.

317
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
It's not the Ministry of Justice.

318
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
Even the spring of the Ministry of Justice

319
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
is in the hands of the government.

320
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
If it's just

321
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,840
the Ministry of Justice

322
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,840
is always in the shadows,

323
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
it's too late to do so.

324
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
This problem

325
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,840
must be solved from the root.

326
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
You mean the government's corruption?

327
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Yes.

328
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
The money of the treasury

329
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,840
has been left to the hands of the government.

330
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
It's useless no matter how much I pay.

331
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,840
The foundation of the rule

332
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,840
is the issue of law.

333
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
The government

334
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
should use the importance.

335
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,840
But

336
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
will it be a good thing?

337
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Zang Hai.

338
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Can you think of this?

339
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Good.

340
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
This is what I'm most worried about.

341
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
The corruption of the government

342
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
is the corruption of the officials.

343
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,840
The government

344
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,840
is too busy to raise the price.

345
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,840
If you want them

346
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
to be free from the people,

347
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,840
you can't solve the problem

348
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
by killing a few.

349
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
I've already told the emperor

350
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
to increase the corruption

351
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
of the officials.

352
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
The government

353
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
is the most important

354
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
in the country.

355
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
The government has to be free

356
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
from the people.

357
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
The government has to be free

358
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
from the people.

359
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
The government has to be free

360
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
from the people.

361
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
It's a good idea.

362
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
But

363
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
should we start with the officials

364
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
of the people first?

365
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
If the government has so many silver,

366
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
how can I not do that?

367
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
But if the government

368
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
has more officials,

369
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
we should start with the officials first.

370
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm afraid that even the emperor

371
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
can't do that.

372
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,840
This is

373
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
the law of the country.

374
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
The law of the country?

375
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
You're a political person.

376
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
In the future,

377
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
you must remember it.

378
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,840
Yes.

379
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Please remember it.

380
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
I came here today.

381
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
I recognized that painting.

382
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I also asked how it came here.

383
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
I really did it.

384
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
It's very suspicious.

385
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
I never hide anything from Tong'er.

386
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
I didn't tell her the truth.

387
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
I feel uncomfortable.

388
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
She is my best friend.

389
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,840
I hope that Mr. Zhao is just your Eunuch.

390
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
He is not your enemy.

391
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Tong'er.

392
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
Dad.

393
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
What are you looking for?

394
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Dad.

395
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Did you really give this painting

396
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
to Shi Yiping?

397
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Which painting?

398
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,840
The one that was installed here.

399
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,840
The one with the great view.

400
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
That one?

401
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Yes.

402
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
The one with the great view.

403
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
The one with the great view.

404
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
The one with the great view.

405
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
That one?

406
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
Before that,

407
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
I went to Shi's house

408
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
to meet with other colleagues in the court.

409
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
We made a reservation.

410
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
We met on the street.

411
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,840
I just picked this one

412
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
to go to the city.

413
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Mei Chengxiang really liked it.

414
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
I gave it to her

415
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
as a reward.

416
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
I went to play with An Tu today.

417
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,840
I saw this painting in her place.

418
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
I thought I saw it wrong.

419
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
But I saw it when I came back.

420
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
It's true.

421
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
With Shi Yiping's life,

422
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
this painting

423
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
and the master's tea house,

424
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
I think it's a good idea to return to the court.

425
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Why did she keep it?

426
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
She said that

427
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
it was a painting from the East Sea.

428
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,840
She came to the emperor

429
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
to give him a gift.

430
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,840
So that's how it was.

431
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Tong'er,

432
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
sit with me for a while.

433
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Since your mother passed away,

434
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
we have been together

435
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
for a long time.

436
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
I've been keeping you

437
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
as a child.

438
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
I went to the clinic

439
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
to talk about things.

440
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,840
But now,

441
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
I'm not young anymore.

442
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,840
I'm a little bit old.

443
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,840
But I like to be independent.

444
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,840
I'll tell you.

445
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
You have been

446
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,840
a child since you were a child.

447
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
You've been a good father.

448
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
You've always been good to me.

449
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
You never regret it.

450
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,840
Father.

451
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Now that the clinic is over,

452
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
don't always think about

453
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
those stories.

454
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
From now on,

455
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
stay at home.

456
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Stay with me.

457
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Master.

458
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I'm busy.

459
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Go back and rest.

460
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Don't worry,

461
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,840
everything will be fine.

462
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Master.

463
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Master.

464
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
I am already a big girl.

465
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
From now on,

466
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Arrange some servants to follow

467
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
so that we don't have any trouble.

468
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Yes.

469
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,840
Mr. Zhang, it's getting late.

470
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
I'm not busy.

471
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

472
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,840
I'll wait for my work in the Palace and the Blue Sky Sword.

473
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Mr. Shi Ge will be in charge of the past.

474
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
I'm lazy and lazy.

475
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
If he sees you like this,

476
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
he'll appreciate you.

477
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
I'll be back.

478
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
It's a pity.

479
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
It's a pity that I'm late.

480
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
I'll be able to invite you to the Palace.

481
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
If there's a person

482
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
who would like to

483
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
introduce himself to me,

484
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
it's a good idea.

485
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
You're not like me.

486
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
I'm not.

487
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Mr. Zhang,

488
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
you followed Zhuang Lu before.

489
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,840
You're a official who's made by the Sword.

490
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
You're making this place

491
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
a mess again.

492
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
You're a mess.

493
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
For Mr. Shi Ge,

494
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
you've been breaking his balance

495
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
for years.

496
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840
Balance?

497
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
But Mr. Shi Ge

498
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
has always been

499
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
so familiar with the work of Cao Jing Xian.

500
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Cao Jing Xian and Zhuang Lu Yan.

501
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,840
In the past, they were the power

502
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
that no one dared to provoke.

503
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Mr. Shi Ge has always been

504
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
fighting with them.

505
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Now they're dead.

506
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Mr. Ge can't keep going.

507
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
It's all in the capital.

508
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Mr. Shi Ge and Cao Jing Xian

509
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
are very close.

510
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
But I didn't expect that

511
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
they would be killed by Cao Jing Xian.

512
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
They're both

513
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
so cruel.

514
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Impossible. I don't believe it.

515
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Mr. Shi Ge is my master for years.

516
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
How would I not know

517
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
what kind of person he is?

518
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Mr. Zhang, let me show you something.

519
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
This is the name of

520
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
the Great Yong Guan Yuan.

521
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Shi Ge gave it to me.

522
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,840
When he was doing the

523
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Censorate of the Ministry of Rites,

524
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
he wrote this name.

525
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Everyone says that

526
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Shi Ge is too arrogant

527
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
to the Great Yong Guan Yuan.

528
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
I didn't expect that

529
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
he's so impulsive.

530
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Years ago,

531
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Mr. Ge saw me as a politician

532
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
and gave me this name.

533
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Now, this name

534
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
has been kept in the cabinet.

535
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
I'll never take it back.

536
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Lu Mi.

537
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Lu Mi.

538
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
I've noticed that.

539
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
This must be the name of Cao Jing Xian.

540
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
His name is Lu.

541
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
He's so impulsive.

542
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Sir.

543
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,840
I didn't know that you're here.

544
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,840
I'm so sorry.

545
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Sit.

546
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Thank you, sir.

547
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
You can leave.

548
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
You're Eunuch Liu.

549
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm really sorry.

550
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
The eunuchs who went to the palace

551
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
and entered the palace

552
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
all have your own rules.

553
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
I want to ask you something.

554
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
I'm sure that

555
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
you know the name.

556
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Lu Min.

557
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Lu Min?

558
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Lu Min.

559
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
You remember it?

560
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Do you really remember it?

561
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
I really remember it.

562
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
He didn't enter the palace

563
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
to be the emperor.

564
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
He was the one

565
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,840
who didn't enter the palace.

566
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
He didn't enter the palace

567
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
because he was the eunuch.

568
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
He was the eunuch.

569
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
The palace has many rules.

570
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
The one who studied here

571
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
has the right to enter the palace

572
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
to be the eunuch.

573
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Lu Min is a very happy person.

574
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
He's a very happy person.

575
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
He's very happy.

576
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
He's not that long.

577
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
He learned

578
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
a lot

579
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
from the eunuchs

580
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
in the hands of our eunuchs.

581
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
By the time

582
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
he was the one who entered the palace

583
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
to be the eunuch.

584
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
He was even better

585
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
than the one who entered the palace

586
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
in the early three years and five years.

587
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
What was his name

588
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
after that?

589
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
I can't remember.

590
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
I remember

591
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
he was in

592
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
the Japanese sword.

593
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
He was working.

594
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
Lu Min, he read books.

595
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
He was very good at speaking.

596
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
He was very good at speaking.

597
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
He always said

598
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
he shouldn't be an eunuch.

599
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
If he was a public official,

600
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
he would be a big official.

601
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
He said

602
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
he should read

603
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
the books in a very good way.

604
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
It's

605
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Da Yongxue Palace.

606
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
Sir,

607
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
since Da Yongxue Palace was established,

608
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
all the books,

609
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
the files, and the original books

610
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
have been stored here.

611
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
You can leave now.

612
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
You can find them yourself.

613
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Yes.

614
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Master.

615
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
You're back.

616
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Have some noodles today.

617
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Don't worry.

618
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
I'm too tired today.

619
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
I have no appetite.

620
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
I want to rest.

621
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
That's a good idea.

622
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
It's a good idea.

623
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
I'll go to the palace.

624
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
I'll go to the palace.

625
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I'll go to the palace.

626
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I'll go to the palace.

627
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
I'll go to the palace.

628
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
The palace is a place

629
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
that's hard to stay.

630
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
You said that

631
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,840
there are too many things to do

632
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
for three people.

633
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
I'm tired for you.

634
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
It's too much for me.

635
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
It's too heavy.

636
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840
How about I tell the master

637
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
that

638
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840
you shouldn't be so heavy?

639
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Let me think about it.

640
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
I'll tell him myself

641
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
Xiao Hai.

642
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
You're really a good friend of master.

643
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
You don't have to

644
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
talk to me all day.

645
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Did you forget

646
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
the master because of Miss Xiang?

647
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Since you said that,

648
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
I don't have

649
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
the reason to talk to master.

650
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
It's not like that.

651
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
I'll leave.

652
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Master.

653
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Do you still remember

654
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
that you had a dream

655
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
and after you finished it,

656
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
what kind of life you wanted to live?

657
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,840
I couldn't reach it.

658
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840
You also told me

659
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
that you would come soon.

660
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Master is right.

661
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
I made a choice now.

662
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
I'll continue to fight

663
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
for the future.

664
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
But I want to know

665
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
what you are.

666
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Me?

667
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Master asked me to help me revenge.

668
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Now that the big picture is revealed,

669
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Master didn't think

670
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
what he would do in the future?

671
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Did your kid

672
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
dislike you?

673
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
You're now in the inner corner.

674
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Master taught you a lot of things.

675
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
I didn't mean that.

676
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
I know you didn't mean that.

677
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
I'm kidding you.

678
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Do you really want to know?

679
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Master,

680
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
do you still remember

681
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,840
that when I was little,

682
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
you took me to lie to the officials?

683
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,840
I remember.

684
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Look,

685
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
now I can

686
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
get the new official title.

687
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
You're so thoughtful.

688
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,840
I used the official title

689
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
but you gave it to Xu Feng

690
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
for the money.

691
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840
But the first class

692
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
finished it.

693
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Master's official title is so similar.

694
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
Could it be

695
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
that he's a good teacher?

696
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
Or you really came to be an official?

697
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,840
No way.

698
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Master is a liar.

699
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
He's so good at it.

700
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
I don't think so.

701
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840
Sometimes,

702
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
people don't live

703
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
for a purpose.

704
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
They live a day by day.

705
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
It's good to have someone around you.

706
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
You're in the capital.

707
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
You're also in the capital.

708
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Where can I go?

709
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
I'll give you a big hand

710
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
and be your chef.

711
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Since you can't teach me,

712
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,840
I'll raise your position.

713
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
You told me

714
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,840
that no matter how good you are,

715
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
you can't compare with your master.

716
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Wake up.

717
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
You've been busy for a day.

718
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
Go to bed.

719
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
I'll sit down and eat when you're asleep.

720
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
I won't call you.

721
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
I promise I'll wake you up

722
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
one night.

723
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Go.

724
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Okay.

725
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,840
I'll be back.

726
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Sorry,

727
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
I'm late.

728
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
I came in early.

729
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
I'm late.

730
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
I'm late.

731
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
I want to see you.

732
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Please.

733
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,840
I'm sorry.

734
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,840
I'll be back.

735
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,840
I'll see you.

736
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,840
I'll be back.

737
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,840
I'll go.

738
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,840
I'll see you.

739
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Eunuch,

740
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,320
my third enemy.

741
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,960
I used to think

742
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,200
I was too eager to revenge.

743
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
I was just thinking about it.

744
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,960
I couldn't stop the investigation.

745
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,960
Until the truth

746
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,000
is revealed.

747
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,400
What did you do?

748
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,440
Do you want to tell His Majesty directly?

749
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,560
No.

750
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,680
Now I also hid Tong Yu.

751
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,840
I can't let it go through His Majesty.

752
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,680
We have to solve it ourselves.

753
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,160
Since I've chosen this path,

754
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,880
I won't have any reason to go to the bottom.

755
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,400
Okay.

756
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,200
Then go ahead.

757
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,200
Give the past and the present to yourself.

758
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,320
An Du,

759
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
get ready.

760
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,560
Tomorrow, I'll ask Zhao Bingwen to come home

761
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,680
