00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,220
Episode 31

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,360
Won't you go take a walk during the sun neglected?

3
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,720
What's going on?

4
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,840
May I ask

5
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,800
did the person a few minutes ago?

6
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,960
The person just now is young master making Ba'er

7
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:22,920
Lord Zang

8
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,720
do not let our Miss tempo you

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,880
Boss Xiang

10
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,840
What a coincidence

11
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,760
I just came back from outside

12
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,680
and came to see you off

13
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,520
What?

14
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,600
You don't need to

15
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,520
see me off so soon?

16
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Boss Xiang, don't blame me

17
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm here to accompany you

18
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,800
I was too arrogant

19
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,680
and I was too arrogant

20
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,920
I failed you

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,160
I wonder if I can

22
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,480
make up for it now

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,760
Didn't you say

24
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,440
you didn't dare to make friends?

25
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,240
Why do you change your mind now?

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,040
Do you have

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,600
more trust in me?

28
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,520
Do you think you're in the top?

29
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,720
Not only trust

30
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
it's good

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
that you don't suspect me

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
I've been

33
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,720
influenced by the rumors

34
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,040
these days

35
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,000
You came to me

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
just for this?

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,640
What rumors?

38
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,080
I didn't hear about it

39
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,320
Boss Xiang

40
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,480
please be kind

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
The rumors of Mr. Eight

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,280
Who said it was from Mr. Eight?

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,880
It has nothing to do with the clinic

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,480
Okay, okay

45
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,120
It has nothing to do with the clinic

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,000
Just pretend that

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,280
it's not from the clinic

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
I'm here today

49
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,880
to ask you

50
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
to help me

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,640
to find a way

52
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,680
to get rid of the rumors

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
I'm here today to help you

54
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
to find a way

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
to get rid of the rumors

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Rumors

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
will pass away in a while

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
The wind will pass

59
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,520
but not the things

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,320
Rumors will stay in people's hearts

61
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,000
As the rumors go on

62
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,200
people will forget

63
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,840
where they heard the news

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
In the end

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,760
they believe it's true

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,240
You care so much

67
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,400
If you want to find out the truth

68
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,920
you have to investigate it thoroughly

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
You're threatening me with Pingjing Marquis

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I dare not

71
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,560
If Boss Xiang is honest

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,920
but really doesn't want to help me

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,680
I can only listen to the heaven's will

74
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,160
Lord Zang is overestimating me

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,480
I'm not that capable

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,240
I don't think I can win over Mr. Eight

77
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
You definitely can buy him

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,560
Zang Hai

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,280
you want to help and Rotte the world

80
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
But there are many ladies

81
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,280
of the Property ownership

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,120
You go and help them

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
why should you

84
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
devote your time

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
positivelyThere must be a rift between us

86
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,960
Why are you so eager to have fun?

87
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,200
You like the masquerade

88
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,280
for the sake of the Empress Dowager?

89
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,200
At that time, she was looking for Mr. Feng Shui

90
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
for the sake of the Empress Dowager

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,120
and then took me away.

92
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,640
I was in the wrong.

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,960
To survive, I had to do this.

94
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,960
Just like the person who was drowning

95
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,280
was catching a log in the river

96
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,480
just to make a living.

97
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,440
But I came across a big tree

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,160
that was standing on the other side of the river.

99
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,920
In my opinion,

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,080
it's not him who chose you,

101
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
but you chose him.

102
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,720
Boss Xiang seems to care about it.

103
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
In the capital, people are like the past.

104
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,440
They are all against each other.

105
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Whoever has enmity with someone,

106
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,080
whoever has grudges with someone,

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,920
they are all reasonable friends.

108
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,640
They can't see or touch each other.

109
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
Only when they meet,

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
they can know.

111
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,680
Well said.

112
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,360
I remember it.

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,640
But don't worry.

114
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,800
I won't be your enemy.

115
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
What we want to do

116
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,160
is not conflicted.

117
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
You can't decide whether to conflict or not.

118
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Boss Xiang, you can just wait and see.

119
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,160
I'm in the capital

120
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,400
to accept your and everyone's interrogation.

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
Who wants to see you?

122
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,640
In the future, you can be good or bad.

123
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
It has nothing to do with me.

124
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,160
That's the stall of Dongxia Shangran.

125
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,760
Dongxia and Dayou Trade is a normal business.

126
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,640
But the business in the capital is not good.

127
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,040
Du Weisi is always checking it.

128
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,200
He just said

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,840
he didn't know

130
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,520
and accepted the interrogation.

131
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,440
Forget it.

132
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
You said you were so pitiful.

133
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,320
If I don't let you go,

134
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,320
it's as bad as Du Weisi.

135
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
Today's gift is so expensive.

136
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,360
I'll beg Mr. Eight for you.

137
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,320
Thank you, Boss Xiang.

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,240
Goodbye.

139
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,720
What would you like to buy?

140
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,720
Feel free to check it.

141
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,880
These are all made by myself.

142
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,680
The embroidery is from the Dongxia family.

143
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,520
I don't know if you like it.

144
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
I'll take this.

145
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,880
Thank you, sir.

146
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,000
Thank you, sir.

147
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
You've let him go.

148
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,400
Who told you

149
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,160
that he should never go back home

150
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,440
and live well in Wulongfeng ?

151
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,520
I can't tell.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,160
He just said

153
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,340
that the rumors

154
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,480
technologies of Pingjing educates him.

155
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,560
He's such a bottomless traitor.

156
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,240
He was even expense- sneaking him money.

157
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,240
Since he didn't listen,

158
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
why should I refuse him?

159
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,960
Let me raise some Γ speakers for Da homeowners.

160
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Let's wait and see

161
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
The good show is still ahead

162
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Come on, come on, come on

163
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Master

164
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Killing Ping Ting Hou

165
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Such a big thing

166
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Don't discuss with me

167
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
You are a hard-boiled egg

168
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
You will be the main elder

169
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Master, I was wrong

170
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
I was going to discuss with you

171
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
But someone knocked me out and took me away

172
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
When I woke up

173
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I saw my senior Guan Feng

174
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
He was also in the back house

175
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
He was also in the back house

176
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
So many things happened

177
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Fortunately, the rumor has spread

178
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Ping Ting Hou has also put down his guard

179
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,960
It's a great success

180
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,960
A rumor can put you in danger

181
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Ping Ting Hou can't be killed

182
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
I want to stay in the Marquis's mansion

183
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
and continue investigating the third person

184
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Since the three of them conspired together

185
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
If I guess it right

186
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
The status of the three people

187
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
should be the same

188
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Not sure

189
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
It's been so long

190
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
There will be a case of

191
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
the case of Guan Li Shengbian

192
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
There will be a missing person

193
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Powerful

194
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
rich

195
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
and even ordinary people

196
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
can't be missed

197
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
I was careless

198
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,960
But how long do we have to investigate?

199
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
It would be great if Ping Ting Hou

200
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
could be killed

201
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
It would be easy

202
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Master

203
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
You're right

204
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I'm kidding

205
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
You take it seriously

206
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
No

207
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Ping Ting Hou can tell us

208
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
about this

209
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
But I can't ask

210
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Even if I'm close to him

211
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Once I ask

212
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
he will suspect me

213
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,960
So I need a person

214
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
who can help me

215
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
to inquire about the news

216
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
and open the mouth of Ping Ting Hou

217
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Then he should be

218
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
the closest person to him

219
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Madam Jiang Xiang

220
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
is from a noble family

221
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
She is a good dog

222
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Even if you value her

223
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
she will treat you like a dog

224
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Zhuang Zhifu is the same

225
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Besides, I'm too rich now

226
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Yang Zhen and Ju Jiao died because of me

227
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,960
They won't believe me easily

228
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
So there is only one person left

229
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,960
But Zhuang Zhixing is too rich

230
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Otherwise, he is a good candidate

231
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
No

232
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
He is the most suitable candidate

233
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
But the people in the capital know

234
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
he is not liked by Ping Ting Hou

235
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Are you sure?

236
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Yes

237
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
I want to help him

238
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
to get the favor and trust of Ping Ting Hou

239
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
so that he can help me to find that person

240
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
How can he help you?

241
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
It's just a matter of experience

242
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
What will you exchange with him?

243
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Let him be the successor of the Marquis

244
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
The successor?

245
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Zhuang Zhifu is the son of the Marquis

246
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
Zhuang Zhixing is a bad person

247
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
He can't help you

248
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
What will he do?

249
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
It's just a man

250
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
who can make him fall in love

251
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I help him to get the favor

252
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
He helps me to find out the secret of Ping Ting Hou

253
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
It's fair

254
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
And I heard that his mother

255
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,960
was a scholar who was favored by Ping Ting Hou

256
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,960
But they were forgotten

257
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Such a mistake

258
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
is not something ordinary people can stand

259
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
So I believe

260
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
he won't refuse

261
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Go

262
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:31,960
The waiting of the former Probably

263
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,960
simply용

264
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Long live!

265
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Long live!

266
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,960
We wish you good luck in your martial arts career

267
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Call Princess Dong Xia in

268
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Your Majesty

269
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Kneel down

270
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Hurry up

271
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Hurry up

272
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Kneel down

273
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Dong Xia is a child

274
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Don't blame him

275
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
It's okay

276
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
I have a good reputation

277
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
From now on

278
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
she is no longer Princess Dong Xia

279
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,960
I will confer her the title of Princess Rou Yuan

280
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,960
A woman should be a low-class

281
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,960
A woman should not be a low-class

282
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Her life depends on the Qin

283
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Her year depends on the Spring

284
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Tea and wine are fragrant

285
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
The light is bright

286
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
The sun is cold

287
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
The night is bright

288
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Light the candle

289
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Arrange a party

290
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
It's quiet

291
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Where is she?

292
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Search carefully

293
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Oh, my

294
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Lady Geng

295
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
A little girl has entered the palace

296
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Did you see her?

297
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,960
I think she went that way

298
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Your Highness, wait for me here

299
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Let's go over there

300
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Yes

301
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
They are gone

302
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Why didn't you tell them?

303
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
You didn't do anything bad

304
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Why did you tell them?

305
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Is it bad to sneak in?

306
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
For me

307
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,960
It's bad to sneak out

308
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
I'm so tired

309
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I'm finally out alone

310
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Are they strict with you?

311
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Yes

312
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
I always have someone following me

313
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
They don't let me chat with others

314
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,960
Look, you are free today

315
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Do you have friends?

316
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
As long as you are willing

317
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
I can help you

318
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Then we will come out and play together often

319
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
I have this

320
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I will put it on for you

321
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Let me see

322
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
How is it?

323
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
It doesn't feel good

324
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Then let's go to the next one

325
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
How is it?

326
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Have you finished your homework today?

327
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
The things that women talk about

328
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
are the same

329
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
over and over again

330
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
The etiquette of the grand master

331
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
and the state affairs of the grand master

332
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
I'm so annoyed

333
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
It's hard for her

334
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Okay

335
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Tell me what you want to say today

336
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Okay

337
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Your Highness

338
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
What do you want to hear?

339
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Is it the love of the people

340
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
or the grudge of the city?

341
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,960
I want to hear the story of Dongxia today

342
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Okay

343
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Then I will tell you

344
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
a story about

345
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
the song of Dongxia

346
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
and the love of the grand master

347
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Liar

348
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
There is no such story at all

349
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,960
I have never been to Dongxia

350
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
I can make it up

351
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
It's already a great success

352
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Unless one day

353
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
you can take me to Dongxia

354
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
I can't

355
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
I know one day

356
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
you can take me to Dongxia

357
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
What's wrong?

358
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Miss home again?

359
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
No

360
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Have you thought about the future?

361
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
I have thought about it

362
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,960
But I haven't thought about it

363
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
But I know

364
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I don't like to be a female worker

365
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
I don't like to read the books

366
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
my father asked me to read

367
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
It's boring

368
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,960
I like to sit on the street all day

369
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
I heard people

370
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
talk about the idle years

371
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
and then make them into stories

372
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
If it's with a film

373
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
it's no good

374
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,960
You say books and film

375
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,960
many people will support you

376
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Then one day

377
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
the reward will be countless

378
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
I will take a bag

379
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
and collect money behind you

380
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
You are a talent

381
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Look at you

382
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,960
You are like a princess

383
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
I hope

384
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
I hope one day

385
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
children in Dongxia

386
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
can eat the sugar cane

387
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
and the people in Dongxia

388
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
can be as rich as the people in Dayong

389
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
I believe

390
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
a princess like you

391
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
will be in Dongxia for a day

392
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
But I am trapped in the capital

393
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
I can't do anything

394
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
I am a princess

395
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
What's the use?

396
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
There is a saying in Dayong

397
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
It's better to know than to know

398
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Since we can't change

399
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
what happened in the past

400
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
we should try

401
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
to live the present

402
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
As for your people in Dongxia

403
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,960
although you are in Dayong

404
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
I believe one day

405
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
you can help them

406
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
as powerful as you

407
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
If so

408
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
you should give upda boil

409
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
You might have many hits

410
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Hurry up

411
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,960
You may fall

412
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,460
You pay 200,000

413
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
local conduct

414
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,040
I have a lot of money

415
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,240
I have lowered the price

416
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,440
The emperor has also promised me

417
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,840
From now on

418
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,360
I will manage this pillow house

419
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,480
emperor

420
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,560
The emperor promised you to manage the pillow house

421
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,200
Don't ask so much

422
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,920
This is my territory

423
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,880
Show you

424
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,400
You told me before

425
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Want a stage

426
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,120
Tell more people stories

427
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,200
This place will be yours in the future

428
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,560
I want to let everyone in the capital know you

429
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,800
I want them all to listen to you tell stories

430
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,720
And me

431
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,000
Just like what I said before

432
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,400
Follow behind you to collect money

433
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,680
Don't worry

434
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I must make you earn a lot of money

435
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,200
Actually you are right

436
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,120
Since I know, I will settle

437
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,840
I will make you earn a lot of money

438
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,680
I will make you earn a lot of money

439
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,520
I will make you earn a lot of money

440
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,360
I will make you earn a lot of money

441
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,440
I will settle

442
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,880
Since I can't leave Dayong

443
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,960
Then while I'm still in the capital

444
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,480
Do more things

445
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,360
I want those homeless people

446
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,760
Who are homeless

447
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,760
More place to hide from the wind and rain

448
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,760
I don't know

449
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
This second young master of Pingjing He's family

450
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I'm in the prison again

451
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,760
The debt is too high

452
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,080
How much this time

453
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,080
Only this month

454
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,800
Nine hundred liang

455
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,840
It's really a foreign son

456
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,400
I heard

457
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
This food and drink are all in the end

458
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,440
This family will be sold sooner or later

459
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,280
is it

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,520
Come come come

461
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
So good

462
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,680
Who is this Pingjing Hou

463
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,480
His eldest son Zhuang Zhifan

464
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
Young

465
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,960
Just became a deputy of the Ministry of Works

466
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,200
Then you say this marquis house

467
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,240
Why is Zhang Guo such an unfaithful son?

468
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,400
Give that marquis house

469
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,080
It's all embarrassing

470
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,720
Come on

471
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,920
I see you really ate

472
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,200
Bear heart leopard guts

473
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,640
Dare to talk nonsense here

474
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,240
If I say who are you

475
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,680
What does it have to do with you

476
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,440
I think the second young master is pretty good

477
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
He is like a young Pingjing Hou

478
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,520
Not necessarily inferior to the eldest son

479
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,840
The eldest son of the first prince is capable of governing the country

480
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,960
No future

481
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,440
What does Zhuang Zhixing compare with him?

482
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,120
Yes

483
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,280
Tell you

484
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
Zhuang Zhixing has

485
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,000
But the blood of Pingjing Hou

486
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,200
Is the grandson of General Xian Zhuang Mu

487
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,240
Zhuang family has been a general for generations

488
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,360
Zhuang Second Young Master now

489
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,240
Just don't show up in the mountains and waters

490
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,880
In the coming days

491
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,600
It must be famous

492
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,560
Just him

493
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,320
Brother, you are so good at joking

494
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,440
Come

495
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Zhuang Second Young Master

496
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,560
Zhuang Second Young Master

497
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,960
Why are you here?

498
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,000
Can't I come?

499
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,960
Can't I be here?

500
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,560
It's okay, you go on

501
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Zhuang Second Young Master

502
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,800
We're leaving

503
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,560
You soak

504
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,600
Yes, you soak

505
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,960
Go go go

506
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,160
Do you want to find someone to control them?

507
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,640
The capital

508
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,240
Look down on my people

509
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,320
I can't control them

510
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,240
Last time I asked you to soak with me

511
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,000
So steady

512
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,680
Why are you here alone today?

513
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,880
I am from a poor family

514
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,880
Never seen the world

515
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,760
Last time I heard Zhuang Second Young Master

516
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,400
A reward for this medicine

517
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
I was worried

518
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,560
Recently, I have been suffering from dark poison

519
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,320
I took the time to come and relieve it

520
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,880
I embarrassed the second young master

521
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,040
Then you are right today

522
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,080
Today in the hot spring water

523
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,360
Added red flowers, single and single-celled

524
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,800
It has the effect of living blood and changing the jade

525
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,880
You just spoke for me

526
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,800
I want to thank you

527
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,200
I'll buy the baths

528
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,880
Thank you, second young master

529
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,120
Come

530
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,880
So comfortable

531
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,440
You also saw

532
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,240
People in the capital look down on me

533
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,360
How can Lord Zang look down on me so much?

534
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,040
The spirit is always wrong

535
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,800
I saw you at first sight

536
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,680
I knew that the second young master is not a mortal

537
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,120
You are so strange

538
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,480
Shouldn't you say this to my eldest brother?

539
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,800
Everyone is a great young master

540
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,280
But I think

541
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,600
Your future path

542
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,720
More broad than the eldest young master

543
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,440
You talk about

544
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,000
The second young master is generous and kind

545
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,960
I am sure

546
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,080
The next master of the Marquis's Mansion must be you

547
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,320
Still don't know me enough

548
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,360
I

549
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,600
I'll try the delicious food in the whole building

550
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,320
If you are bored, drink the beautiful wine of the Moon Tower

551
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,320
When you are in a good mood, go to the painting workshop

552
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,840
Talk to the girls

553
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,280
When you are in a bad mood

554
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,680
I'll bet a lot

555
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,560
Just my living room

556
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,080
Others are envious

557
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,600
Why do you have to be the master of the family?

558
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,000
Young master is worried

559
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,840
These needles are your own choice

560
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,440
Or someone is trying to persuade you

561
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,200
Make you not care about others

562
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,560
Only know these

563
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,080
What about eating, drinking and playing?

564
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,320
It seems that today is not a coincidence

565
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,320
You are prepared

566
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,840
Wait for me

567
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,280
Yes, coincidental encounter

568
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,240
But these are all true

569
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,840
I checked the account book of the Marquis's Mansion for a year

570
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,680
It's the big lady Jiang Xiang

571
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,600
For you in the restaurant, the club and the gambling house

572
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,560
Bought almost 30,000 taels of silver

573
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,800
I'll help you in silence

574
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,320
Do you think you met a mother

575
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
A good mother who is hard to meet

576
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,960
Or a scheming minister

577
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,200
Raised you as a loser

578
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,200
Since then, I have been fighting with her son

579
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,520
Where is the big lady?

580
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,920
I'm sorry

581
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,400
Do you see the words on it?

582
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,240
Jiaxiaqu

583
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,600
Jiaxia refers to the courtyard of the Marquis's Mansion

584
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,120
Jiaxiaqu means the second young master took it away

585
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,440
But Jia is a Chinese character

586
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,240
It means all the money

587
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,400
Was taken away by the pig

588
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,480
The Marquis's Mansion is a small restaurant

589
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,920
When the family reunites

590
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,600
The second young master was left in the wine temple

591
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
It disappointed the Marquis

592
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Sooner or later, the Marquis

593
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,600
Naturally, you have no place in his heart

594
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,960
You don't want to go

595
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,000
Or someone doesn't want you to go at all

596
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,240
Second young master

597
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,160
When will you endure these humiliation?

598
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,160
The good of the big lady

599
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,320
It's easy to accept

600
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,200
Refuse to come

601
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,280
Don't you want to fight?

602
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,520
What do you want me to fight?

603
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,000
Fight with the big young master

604
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,280
If you believe

605
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,560
I'm ready

606
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,460
��

607
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,800
what do you think

608
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,280
Can i really

609
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,680
Of course

610
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,440
Mr. universes

611
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,240
There is neitherаете modo

612
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,480
Nor have the talent for the people's hearts

613
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,720
I think he

614
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,600
It's just up here

615
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,440
and from there,

616
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,640
only tailors can be succeeded.

617
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,760
If someone like her

618
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,320
becomes the next Marquis Pingjing,

619
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,640
then the Prime Marquis Manor

620
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,000
will have to Sanctus Aureus

621
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,680
in her ===

622
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
But Second Master

623
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,680
is different.

624
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,720
The Second Master is magnanimous

625
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,520
and has his own talent back then.

626
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,160
He'llie a bright future

627
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,880
and give excellence to all.

628
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm sorry.

629
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,680
Sang Hai.

630
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,800
No one has ever said

631
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
such a thing to me.

632
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,520
I'm happier

633
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,760
than I am when I hear you say it.

634
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,920
We must have a good drink today.

635
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,440
OK.

636
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,240
Then I'll do as you say.

637
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,200
Everything is up to you.

638
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,280
OK.

639
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,640
Here.

640
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,000
This is the Tusu wine

641
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
I've been saving in the whole building.

642
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,920
I'll take it out and give you a try.

643
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,080
Here.

644
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,080
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

645
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,840
Here.

646
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,160
Sang Hai.

647
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,200
You've been worried about me a lot.

648
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,880
But I think

649
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,400
you're not only going to make up for me,

650
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,040
but also help yourself.

651
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,280
Young Master can get to where he is today.

652
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,440
He can't leave Jiang Xiang

653
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,840
and help him with his work.

654
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,440
Even if I'm under his control,

655
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,200
I'm just

656
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,360
a little pet.

657
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,400
He won't treat me differently.

658
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,040
But Young Master is different.

659
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,200
Young Master is now empty-handed.

660
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,640
Why don't you fight for him?

661
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,880
You're so clear-minded.

662
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,160
My brother is now an official in the court.

663
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,720
He's my father's nephew.

664
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,640
You can't help me

665
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,040
with anything.

666
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
So you're going to be under my control.

667
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,760
Winning is a small bet.

668
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,920
Winning alone.

669
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,720
You know how to bet.

670
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,080
I'm not better than Young Master.

671
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,360
Sang Hai.

672
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,960
After today's talk,

673
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,000
I found out that

674
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,080
someone in the mansion

675
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,600
was worried about me

676
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,640
and thought for me.

677
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,240
Here.

678
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,520
Cheers.

679
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,840
You...

680
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,080
I'm not good at drinking.

681
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,960
Are you looking down on me?

682
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,720
No.

683
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,920
Here.

684
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,560
Cheers.

685
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,680
Good wine.

686
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,240
I'm good at drinking.

687
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
But I can't

688
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,200
carry or lift my shoulders,

689
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,520
only enjoy.

690
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,240
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

691
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,600
Young Master is serious.

692
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,800
If you don't believe me,

693
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,320
I'll tell you something.

694
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,720
When I was a kid,

695
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,880
I was caught by a bad boy

696
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,040
and locked in the tunnel.

697
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,560
I almost died in one night.

698
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,920
So I can't

699
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,000
suffer at all.

700
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Young Master is blessed.

701
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,280
He'll have a future.

702
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,160
I still remember that bad boy.

703
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,760
At that time,

704
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,600
he was beaten by the princess of Dongxia

705
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,480
to find his father.

706
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,440
He caught me

707
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,200
to find out

708
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,320
his father's whereabouts.

709
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,160
Do you know his father's name?

710
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,800
How would I know?

711
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,200
His father's name is Kuai Duo.

712
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,080
He was the regent of Qingtian.

713
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,680
But he was killed

714
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,840
on the second day.

715
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,480
The boy died naturally.

716
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,480
I remember

717
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,960
he was badly injured on his back.

718
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
They said

719
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,920
the two scarves were like a sword

720
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,840
in one line.

721
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,240
They were exactly like you.

722
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,080
You're not the bad boy.

723
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,800
You're funny.

724
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,440
I was born with

725
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,080
a scar on my back.

726
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,040
I was beaten by my master.

727
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,200
Really?

728
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,160
But it's true.

729
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,480
He died long ago.

730
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,560
If he didn't die,

731
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,240
he would be as old as you.

732
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,080
He would try to get close to my father

733
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,680
and kill him

734
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,000
by chance.

735
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,800
Mr. Cheng,

736
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,560
what you said

737
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,120
really scared me.

738
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,160
I didn't understand

739
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,440
the evil boy and the secret door.

740
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,440
I told you before.

741
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,880
I came to the Marquis's Mansion

742
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,320
to give myself

743
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,200
a place to rest.

744
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,400
If there's anything wrong with the Marquis,

745
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,480
it's no good for us.

746
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,040
You're right.

747
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,880
Maybe you did it for your future.

748
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,640
Or

749
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
you found that you couldn't kill my father.

750
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,360
So you ordered the Western Jing

751
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,080
to kill me.

752
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,880
Am I right?

753
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,720
You're right.

754
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,560
You're the one.

755
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,040
You didn't die.

756
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,080
Now you're here to avenge me.

757
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,320
Mr. Cheng,

758
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,000
you're drunk.

759
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,280
Let me say it again.

760
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,520
You've got the wrong person.

761
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,600
I'm not a hostage.

762
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm a dead man.

763
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,640
If you don't believe me,

764
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,840
you can check my identity.

765
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,760
I'm very sober now.

766
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,400
Listen,

767
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,880
the first time we met in the stockroom,

768
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,920
I remembered you.

769
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,360
Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao died because of you.

770
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,400
I thought you were wrong.

771
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,040
The wine

772
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,400
has the blood and jade.

773
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,720
Even if you drink it,

774
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,680
it will show.

775
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,560
Mr. Cheng,

776
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
no one will believe your nonsense.

777
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,200
The scar on your back is the best proof.

778
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,200
We can go back now

779
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,160
and show Wu Tian

780
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,840
who you are

781
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,080
and how good you are.

782
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,160
See if he will spare your life.

783
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,240
Since you've seen it,

784
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,520
why did you tell me directly?

785
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,840
Because my father's hands

786
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,520
have been stained with your blood.

787
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,360
I don't want him to kill you again.

788
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,120
Let's go.

789
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,200
On that night 10 years ago,

790
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,680
I was sick in your house and didn't sleep.

791
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,480
I wanted to find my father

792
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,520
and make him disyou fight with me

793
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,200
Father

794
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,840
And I got sleepy later,

795
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,120
I waited for him out of his room.

796
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,200
He came back very late.

797
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,880
I wanted to wake him up.

798
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
But his face was so gloomy.

799
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,320
I knew

800
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,600
something must have happened

801
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,640
Young Master, where are you going this early morning?

802
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:38,780
To the house of the

803
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,620
Now bought.

804
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,800
They...

805
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,360
The family's Terre- 여러분들

806
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,680
Mandarin

807
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,260
The matter of Technology

808
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,200
They have already...

809
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,040
They are doing it

810
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
Zhinu

811
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
I know you've been through a lot

812
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980
and hate my father

813
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,780
But I can't let you take revenge

814
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,260
Because I only have him

815
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,140
Kill him

816
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,180
I'll kill you first

817
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,780
Leave the mansion

818
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,260
Leave the capital

819
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,060
Never come back

820
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,980
If I can't do it

821
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,660
I'll give you only one day

822
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,740
How did he know?

823
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,340
He's smarter than I thought

824
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,660
The first time I met him in the stockroom

825
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,900
he remembered me

826
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,300
Then I killed Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao

827
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,060
He suspected me

828
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,540
He didn't see the scar on my back

829
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,420
But he remembered it

830
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,460
after hearing the description of my brothers

831
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,100
The scar was not obvious

832
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,940
But today at the exhibition

833
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,100
he asked me to drink the secret medicine

834
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
The scar was revealed

835
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,620
I planned to bite him to death

836
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,420
But he wanted to take me to see Pingjing Duke

837
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,940
I was suspicious of him

838
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,380
I was suspicious of him

839
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,740
You're so annoying

840
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
What should we do now?

841
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,420
But Zhuang Zhixing didn't punish me enough

842
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,740
He pitied me

843
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,060
and gave me one day

844
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,980
to leave the mansion and the capital

845
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,900
One day?

846
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,820
You'll go to the Linyuan Temple with Pingjing Duke tomorrow

847
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,500
Zhuang Zhixing must go too

848
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,300
When we arrive at the Linyuan Temple

849
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,180
Zhuang Zhixing will kill Guan Feng

850
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,860
when he's in a bad mood

851
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,060
He's not a bad man

852
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,020
He deserves it

853
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
You're soft-hearted

854
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,220
I'm not

855
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,420
You don't want to kill innocent people

856
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,260
but you let your family go

857
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,020
Zhuang Zhixing is like a firework that can be lit at any time

858
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,740
You can't do what you want

859
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,780
You can kill yourself

860
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,700
I know

861
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,260
I'll handle it carefully

862
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,300
If I really want to kill him

863
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,540
I'll do it myself

864
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,580
I have to admit

865
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,640
I was too careless

866
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,820
Just so you know

867
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,460
Sorry

868
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,820
Mother

869
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,420
I'm here to see you

870
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
I'm not a man of the house

871
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
I'll scold her when I get back

872
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
How is it going down there?

873
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Very good

874
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
You don't have to worry about me

875
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Father will go to the forest tomorrow

876
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I'll invite him to see you

877
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Madam treats me well

878
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
She has never treated me badly

879
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
She just keeps me safe

880
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,500
She wants to raise me as a useless person

881
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
I can't fight with my brother

882
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
But she is really worried

883
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
I've never thought about it

884
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
I met an old friend

885
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
I know she is coming back

886
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
to kill Die and avenge her family

887
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I want her to leave the capital

888
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
and never come back

889
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,500
The green grass is green

890
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,500
The sound of the sound of tears

891
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
The sound of the sound of tears

892
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
The sound of the sound of tears

893
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,500
The sound of the sound of tears

894
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
The sound of the sound of tears

895
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
The sound of the sound of tears

896
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
The sound of the sound of tears

897
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
The sound of the sound of tears

898
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
The sound of the sound of tears

899
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,500
My eyes are The Club of Brightness

900
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
The silver has a Academyvoice

901
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,500
The debt of all offerings

902
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
It's not as dark

903
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
ala

904
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,400
Lassas

905
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,400
I'm the one who is in the clouds, I'm the one who is in the clouds

906
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,400
I'm the one who is in the clouds, I'm the one who is in the clouds

907
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,400
I'm the one who is in the clouds, I'm the one who is in the clouds

908
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:45,400
I'm the one who is in the clouds, I'm the one who is in the clouds

909
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,400
I'm the one who is in the clouds, I'm the one who is in the clouds

910
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,400
When the sun rises, the sun sets

911
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,400
With the military, we sing the song of the high

912
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
In the dream, it's me

913
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
In the dream, it's me

914
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
In the dream, it's me

915
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
In the dream, it's me

916
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
The world is me

917
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,400
The world is me

918
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,400
You are me too
