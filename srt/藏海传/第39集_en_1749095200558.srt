How to see falcon

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 14

3
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,800
What was the big deal?

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
The queen is going to marry Haidong.

5
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
The princess is going to leave the palace.

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
But it's better to leave the palace.

7
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,600
What did you say?

8
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,400
The princess is going to marry Haidong.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
What's the hurry?

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,800
Do you want the princess to marry you?

11
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,400
Drink.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Drink.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Drink.

14
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
It's time to eat.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
Greetings, princess.

16
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,200
Princess.

17
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,200
An Tu.

18
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,600
Your Majesty, you can only watch.

19
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
You may leave.

20
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Yes.

21
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,600
Zang Hai, I'm leaving.

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,400
You really want to marry He?

23
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
Why do you want to hear him?

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Don't ask.

25
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,400
Anyway,

26
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
I promise to see you for the last time.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,600
If you have anything to say,

28
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,400
say it.

29
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
They only said these.

30
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
They didn't say anything else.

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,200
Yes.

32
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,800
They just talked about what they used to do in the past.

33
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
They even said something else.

34
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
They didn't say anything else.

35
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
You may leave.

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Yes.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,600
I've been in Da Yong for ten years.

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
I've been hoping for a day to go home.

39
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,000
I went back to my family.

40
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,200
But now my mother is gone.

41
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,000
I've become a person.

42
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,000
I suddenly feel that this place is so strange.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's so strange.

44
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Mo Mo, I know you've been missing your mother.

45
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
These days,

46
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
I've told you about those past things.

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,600
I feel like I've returned home.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,800
Thank you.

49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
Your Highness, you're finally back.

50
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,400
But you have to go to another strange place.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I should have gone with you.

52
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
But Your Majesty, I don't want you to

53
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
leave any other thoughts.

54
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
Tomorrow is the day off.

55
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,200
Why are you so sad?

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Mo Er Sa is not my type.

57
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
No matter I cry or laugh,

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,200
she won't care.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,400
The envoy of the East Sea will be married in thirty miles.

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,400
By then, I'll send the minister to be your marriage

61
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
and give you safely to them.

62
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,600
Your Majesty, I want to send a boat to the sea.

63
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm worried that as long as I go to the East Sea,

64
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,800
you'll kill her immediately.

65
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,000
So I want her to follow my marriage

66
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,600
and go to the East Sea with me.

67
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,200
After the marriage, I'll let her go.

68
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:08,800
Sister, I only beg you to promise me one thing, okay?

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
My sister is going to be married tomorrow.

70
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,400
I'm not going to promise you this.

71
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Mother loves you the most.

72
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,000
But she can't give you a head of a tree

73
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
and watch you leave the house.

74
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
I know that you won't say it.

75
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
You're afraid that I'll take your throne.

76
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
But you don't have to worry.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,600
I've already promised Mother

78
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
that I'll fulfill her wish

79
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
for the last time I go to the East Sea.

80
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,600
What's her wish?

81
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
To find Gui Xi.

82
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Gui Xi has fallen into Zhao Bingwen's hand.

83
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,800
Now that Emperor Yong is gone,

84
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
he'll surely be able to do something.

85
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,280
He once said that

86
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
he would use Gui Xi in the East Sea to build a army.

87
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
When that time comes,

88
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,200
no matter who and which one is married with in the East Sea,

89
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
will you be able to

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
re-enact Gui Xi again?

91
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
I'm not his rival.

92
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,200
But you're different.

93
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,800
Sister, you're the Queen of the East Sea.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,800
If you're willing to help me...

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Stop thinking about it.

96
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,800
Get ready to get married.

97
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,440
Su Zi

98
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,400
My heart, how about you what about me?

99
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:23,820
night

100
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
I won't come back.

101
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Princess, get up!

102
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Princess, get up!

103
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
That's the Marquis of the Eastern Courtyard's wedding.

104
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
We've already walked 30 miles.

105
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Yes.

106
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Your Highness, is it the Sea-Demon-Demon?

107
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Yes.

108
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm here to welcome Princess Dongxia,

109
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
who is ordered by Khan.

110
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Are you really going to marry He?

111
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Why did you listen to him?

112
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Don't ask.

113
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Anyway,

114
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I promise I'll see you for the last time.

115
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
If you have anything to say,

116
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
just say it.

117
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
If I knew it would be like this,

118
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
I'd rather stay in the building.

119
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
But without you,

120
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
how can I win?

121
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,440
How will you pay back the debt?

122
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
I can't go back anyway.

123
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Please pay back the money.

124
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
It's easy to say the other debts.

125
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,440
But you have to beg me

126
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
to let the Eighth Prince

127
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,440
tell the master of the game.

128
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Not only did he ruin his good deed,

129
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
he also locked the door for others.

130
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,440
He pushed you up to their house.

131
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I forgot that.

132
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
What happened next?

133
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
What happened next?

134
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
I sold the house,

135
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
and the money was returned to you.

136
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Boss Xiang,

137
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
this is the money you owe me.

138
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Won't you let me pay back my debt?

139
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm going to marry someone anyway.

140
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Just take it as your debt.

141
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Just give it to me.

142
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Let's make a deal.

143
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
No way.

144
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Boss Xiang owes me money.

145
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I can't leave me here alone.

146
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Aunt,

147
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
I trust you in this palace.

148
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
It's only you.

149
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I want to ask you for a favor.

150
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Please find a general

151
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,440
who is known as Zhuang Zhi Xing.

152
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
I have no business with him.

153
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
All the money you owe me

154
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
is in the car.

155
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Please take care of our princess.

156
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Don't worry.

157
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
We will let you and Ke Han

158
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
get married successfully.

159
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Please follow me to the Eastern Sea

160
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,440
and take care of the princess.

161
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Thank you.

162
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Go back to the city.

163
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Princess,

164
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
you can come out now.

165
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Go.

166
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Go back now.

167
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
I'll follow them to the Eastern Sea.

168
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Lord Zhang,

169
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
I command General Feng Zhuang

170
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
to capture you here.

171
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Xiang Hong,

172
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Thank you.

173
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Take the car away.

174
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,360
General, Relax

175
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,840
General is in the us closer

176
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,240
They are coverage above

177
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,240
As efficient as possible

178
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,920
Extremely air threatening

179
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,560
It seems that

180
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:50,920
They are taking protectors

181
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,980
More than one and voted about

182
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,820
piece of work

183
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,220
General wasting all hand

184
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,040
Director Zhang

185
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,100
General's rules

186
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,020
the wider opinion

187
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,760
Are very important

188
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,480
Isn't it easy

189
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,280
Look at my exams

190
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,380
Before you ask

191
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,140
Elder Brother

192
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,840
Comrade-in- blindfold

193
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,580
Congratulations

194
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,640
This year

195
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,920
We will be on the same page

196
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,960
You need to fine-tune

197
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,840
Our strategy

198
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,240
Which way does he take me?

199
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,280
Why don't we go to the Waterji Valley?

200
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,280
You need to head out well

201
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,840
I don't want to helpR broadband

202
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,960
You even have your day of diplomacy

203
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,160
Alright

204
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,320
Bye

205
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,520
I'm not sure.

206
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,120
But only for a year.

207
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,320
You've really changed a lot.

208
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Only for a year.

209
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,520
I think it's been like five or six years.

210
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,520
I used to think time passes too quickly when I was young.

211
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,520
But when I really had a hard time, I knew

212
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,520
what a day is like.

213
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,920
It's not easy for you to walk this path in the border.

214
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,160
You don't have to play here,

215
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,120
as long as you dedicated yourself.

216
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,720
I'm fine.

217
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,320
But I don't remember

218
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,940
what your interests were,

219
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,120
or what you're trying to do.

220
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
I know

221
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
A long time ago, General Ding Guo was sick and sick.

222
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
The court called me General Zhao Yi.

223
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
They asked me to replace him.

224
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
I am at this point.

225
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I didn't let you down.

226
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,520
You grew up faster than I thought.

227
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Now you can be alone.

228
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're right.

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,600
I have the blood of the Zhuang family.

230
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,600
I only know what it means to kill a person.

231
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I only know what it means to make a whole family cry.

232
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
What about you?

233
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
What have you been through?

234
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
I was killed by Zhao Yingwen.

235
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Fortunately, I escaped.

236
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
I came to Dongxia.

237
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Why did General Zhao treat you so well?

238
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Because he is my third enemy.

239
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
I didn't expect you to lie to me.

240
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Zhao Yingwen killed Shiyi Ping.

241
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,600
He took over the mansion and framed His Majesty.

242
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
He framed me.

243
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Since then, he has been alone.

244
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
He has taken the blood from His Majesty.

245
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,600
No one in the court can resist him.

246
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
These are all in the court.

247
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I am at the border.

248
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
What do you want?

249
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Sanghai, we finally got together.

250
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Let's drink together.

251
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
I am tired of waiting for me in the bank.

252
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
You go to the military office and do your work.

253
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
I will go to the military office.

254
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I will go to the military office.

255
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I will go to the military office.

256
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I will go to the military office.

257
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
You go to the military office and do your work.

258
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Have a good rest.

259
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
I will come to you tomorrow morning.

260
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Okay.

261
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
I have sent some food to the court.

262
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
You go back and eat.

263
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
We have plenty of time.

264
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
What are you talking about?

265
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Why are you so sad?

266
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,600
I thought Zhuang Zhixing would grow up quickly in the army.

267
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,600
But I didn't expect that in just a short time,

268
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
he would become Zhao Yi Jiang.

269
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
He is a great man.

270
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
He is a great man.

271
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
He is a great man.

272
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
He is a great man.

273
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
He is a great man.

274
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
He has become a great man.

275
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
I told him about Zhao Bingwen's real face.

276
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
He is so impulsive.

277
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I think Zhuang Zhixing has met Zhao Bingwen secretly.

278
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,600
It seems that Zhao Bingwen's actions are even earlier than I thought.

279
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Will he use another way to save us this time?

280
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
I don't think so.

281
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Otherwise, we won't have the chance to talk like this.

282
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
But Zhuang Zhixing will give us the news at any time.

283
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Zhao Bingwen will be in danger here sooner or later.

284
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I heard the outside world talk.

285
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
They ordered the court to use the Eastern Xia Palace.

286
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
They even forced people to rebuild Fengshan Tai.

287
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Fengshan Tai has been in the army for many years.

288
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Why did they rebuild it?

289
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
They want to rebuild it.

290
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Zhao Bingwen will never do this without reason.

291
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:54,020
It must be related to the Ghost

292
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,020
I even asked my sister about the Ghost's death.

293
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
But she didn't know anything.

294
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
Because my mother died in Dayong,

295
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,020
I couldn't tell her about the Ghost's death.

296
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,020
But there is a demon who has been with my mother for many years.

297
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,020
She told me a legend about the Ghost's death.

298
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,020
There is another heaven in the Eastern Xia.

299
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,020
There is a poor road there.

300
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,020
But the sky is different from the blue sky we saw.

301
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
It's a closed galaxy.

302
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,020
There is the world of the Ghost's soldiers.

303
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,020
Cao Hai, I forgot something.

304
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,020
You two are here to live.

305
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,020
You can't move.

306
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
I want the court to protect you.

307
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,020
If you need anything, you can tell her.

308
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
Thank you, general.

309
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,020
You must take good care of Mr. Han and Miss Xiang.

310
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
Yes.

311
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
Mr. Fang, I'm outside.

312
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,020
You can call me anytime.

313
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,020
I don't know about this.

314
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,020
But you can't tell her.

315
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,020
Be careful.

316
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
Listen to me.

317
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,020
Let's go.

318
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,020
Where are you going?

319
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,020
It's not easy to see him once.

320
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,020
How can you leave without saying goodbye?

321
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
I asked the secret letter to you.

322
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,020
I wanted to leave the Eastern Xia and see you.

323
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
I wanted to destroy your power and your reputation.

324
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,020
But I didn't expect you to turn your back on Zhao wa.

325
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
So what?

326
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
No matter what kind of person he is,

327
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:48,020
I only know that he can give me what I want.

328
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
He wants you to re-enact Feng Shan Tai.

329
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
He's just a liar.

330
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,020
He really wants the Eastern Xia and the workers to gather together

331
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,020
and use the ghostly force to turn them into heroes.

332
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Do you really want to follow him?

333
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
He wants to do what he wants to do.

334
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,020
It's right or wrong.

335
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,020
I'll make a decision.

336
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,020
Then you can think about it.

337
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,020
You only know that he's the murderer of the Mianmen family.

338
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,020
He's the third enemy I've been looking for.

339
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,020
But I don't know his other side.

340
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,020
Zhao Bingwen is my benefactor.

341
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,020
He saved me after the Mianmen family.

342
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
He raised me for ten years.

343
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
He did the first thing,

344
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,020
and made me come to your father.

345
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,020
He helped you to revenge?

346
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,020
Zhao Bingwen is the only one who has been pretending to be a traitor

347
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
for decades.

348
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
But for the ghostly force,

349
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,020
he wants me to revenge on them.

350
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,020
After I get the ghostly force,

351
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,020
he wants to kill me again.

352
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,020
He doesn't even know how to spare his master.

353
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,020
You're still useful to him.

354
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,020
If you lose your value,

355
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,020
he'll throw you away without hesitation.

356
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,020
He'll kill you and kill you.

357
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
When you're with him,

358
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,020
the first one to guess is you.

359
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:33,020
The first one to eliminate him is you.

360
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Do you just want to tell me this?

361
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,020
I promised to help you

362
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,020
to get the approval of the King of Peking.

363
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,020
I'll be the honor of the Zhuang family one day.

364
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,020
But I didn't expect

365
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,020
you'd walk on a road like your father did.

366
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,020
Cao Hai,

367
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,020
I've promised to be your master since you got married.

368
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
Now I can give you a new name

369
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
and a new identity

370
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
to hide the news that you're still alive.

371
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,020
Do you want to follow my father?

372
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Follow me?

373
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,020
What I want to do now

374
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,020
is to destroy the throne.

375
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
I'll destroy the throne.

376
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
What should we do now?

377
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
Wait.

378
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Wait.

379
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Wait.

380
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,020
Okay, then destroy the throne.

381
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
Go.

382
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Go.

383
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
We've been looking for so many days.

384
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,020
We haven't found any entry.

385
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,020
Even if Zhuang Zhi Xing said where Feng Shan Tai is,

386
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,020
my father's path to the capital

387
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,020
has been blocked.

388
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,020
We can only think of a way.

389
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,020
But since it's a place with a lot of people,

390
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,020
we'll have to follow the way of the wind.

391
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,020
But this mountain is so lonely.

392
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,020
If we find it easily,

393
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,020
it won't be a secret.

394
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,020
If we can't find it,

395
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
we'll have to find it.

396
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
You've mentioned it in the legend.

397
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,020
The mountain is the source of the 100 rivers in the east.

398
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,020
Maybe we can find it through the river.

399
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,020
Maybe we'll find it.

400
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
I've been to the east of the country.

401
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,020
I've been to the west of the country.

402
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,020
This place should be a deep river.

403
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,020
But now it's a shallow place.

404
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
When Feng Shan Tai was in the mountain,

405
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
the mountain must have been damaged.

406
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
That's why there's this change.

407
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,020
I think the river is in the cave

408
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,020
that flows from Feng Xi.

409
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,020
So, as long as we find the way to the river,

410
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,020
we can find the way in.

411
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
Yu.

412
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
Yu.

413
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,020
There's no way.

414
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
Will the entrance be here?

415
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,020
Yu.

416
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
Yu.

417
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
The closed heart river.

418
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,020
It's the world of the Yin soldiers.

419
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,020
The world of the Yin soldiers.

420
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
The world of the Yin soldiers.

421
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,020
This is the ninth generation of the Eastern Xia.

422
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,020
The name is called the Fox-Headed.

423
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
He's my old man.

424
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
But I've never seen him before.

425
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,020
The Eastern Xia was strong by the ghost blood.

426
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,020
The ghost blood was not known to the public.

427
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,020
That's why it was lost in the hands of Zhuang Lu Yin.

428
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,020
It's said that the famous Fox-Headed

429
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,020
brought his life and skills to the Yin soldiers

430
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
by the ghost blood.

431
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,020
Do you think the Yin soldiers really exist?

432
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,020
I don't believe that there are ghosts in this world.

433
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,020
The ghosts are just to trigger people

434
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,020
to spread the spread of the world.

435
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,020
They're just to give up hope for the evil.

436
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:30,020
I just don't understand what the Yin soldiers are.

437
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,020
How did they get the ghost blood?

438
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,020
Zang Hai.

439
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,020
Someone really came here.

440
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,020
It must be my father.

441
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,020
Now we're here.

442
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,020
We're here at the beginning of everything.

443
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,020
I'm sorry.

444
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,020
Since I made the same choice as my father,

445
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:26,020
it's time to do something that I didn't do before.

446
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,020
What are those?

447
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,020
Zang Hai.

448
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,020
Are these the ghosts?

449
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,020
Be careful.

450
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,020
Be careful.

451
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,020
ENDU, look.

452
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,020
These are the Dongxia's men?

453
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,020
That's right.

454
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,020
They're the Dongxia's clan.

455
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
How did they get here?

456
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,020
Did they experience something before they died?

457
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,020
Maybe the truth is there.

458
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,020
ENDU.

459
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,020
Zang Hai.

460
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,020
Someone died here.

461
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,020
Who could it be?

462
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
No other blood stereo?

463
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,660
No other8

464
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,020
Let me talk to him.

465
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
They know each other well.

466
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,480
The people brought him here.

467
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,300
All of a sudden,

468
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,480
Where are they?

469
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,700
In the폭 35 years

470
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,640
hardstruck by긴军对讨伐东下

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,360

east's troops韭 é drum

473
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,120
defeated

474
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,800
lost hands

475
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,340
Venice almost lost their line

476
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,340
to her.

477
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Maybe she can use the first day of the winter

478
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
of the King of Dongxia

479
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,340
to use the Ghost-Riding and retreating enemies.

480
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,340
At this time, Dongxia has reached the King of the Village.

481
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,340
After the Queen is pregnant,

482
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,340
she wants to kill Zhang Mie to enter the Dansui Mountain.

483
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,340
Zhang Mie is able to see the rain.

484
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,340
She successfully took out the Ghost-Riding

485
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,340
from the memory of the King of Fu Xian.

486
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,340
This is the battle of the King of Dongxia.

487
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,340
The Queen has summoned 30,000 soldiers as her front-line soldiers

488
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,340
and has held a ceremony in front of the town.

489
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,340
She told the people at the time of the assassination

490
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,340
that she would seek revenge from the King of the Village.

491
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,340
At the battlefield, the members of the Thunder Valley were shouting,

492
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,340
the King of the Village was about to die.

493
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,340
But the King of the Village didn't come.

494
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,340
So, the Ghost-Riding itself

495
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
still has a kind of poison that is called the Sword of the World.

496
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Zhang Mie used her own blood to make the Ghost-Riding

497
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,340
take out the poison leaves that the Ghost-Riding left.

498
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,340
The members of the tribe who have been poisoned

499
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
by it have discovered that they can no longer feel the pain

500
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,340
and the wound will continue to heal.

501
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,340
In the later period of time,

502
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,340
the army has been fighting against the King of the Village

503
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,340
and they have no more to fight.

504
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,340
The King of the Village is now in the Dansui Mountain.

505
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,340
The more fierce the wind and fire are, the more rumors are.

506
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,140
Everyone believes that the group that doesn't need to be

507
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,340
involved in the war is the cause of the death of the King.

508
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,340
The East and the South of the army

509
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,340
has attacked several cities in the area.

510
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,340
They are about to attack the Dansui Mountain.

511
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,340
The Dansui Mountain is the drug that enters the government.

512
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,340
Once it is lost, the East will be able to enter the city

513
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
and take it to the capital.

514
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,340
But the King of the Village finds that

515
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,340
the cause of the war is gradually getting worse.

516
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,340
He becomes too much against me.

517
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,340
There is only a terrible death.

518
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,340
As the descendant of the Holy Mother of the West,

519
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,340
in order to prevent them from causing more disaster,

520
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,340
the King uses his blood of the royal family

521
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,340
to remove the poison of the Ghost-Riding.

522
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,340
He has been living for a long time.

523
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,340
He has finally stopped the Ghost-Riding.

524
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
The East and the South of the army

525
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
have sent a bad message.

526
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
The Queen is dead.

527
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
The army is also at the bottom of the road.

528
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,340
Before the death of the King,

529
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,340
the Queen left a message to kill the Holy Emperor

530
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,340
and to remove the Ghost-Riding.

531
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,340
The Queen will never be able to open her mouth.

532
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,340
So this is the truth of the cause of the war.

533
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
So the blood of the King of the East

534
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,340
was not used to open the Ghost-Riding.

535
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,340
It was used to stop it.

536
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
This book can prove it.

537
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
There is a move over there.

538
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,340
What's going on?

539
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,340
Watch out!

540
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Watch out!

541
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,340
There is no wind coming out.

542
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
It's a trap.

543
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
An Du!

544
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
This is all a illusion!

545
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,340
These shadows are fake.

546
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
What we just saw is...

547
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,340
The mural here is a vivid color.

548
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,340
There are some special smell.

549
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,340
I'm afraid it's because the mask was removed

550
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,340
to prevent the Ghost-Riding from being taken away.

551
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,340
We have to change the illusion

552
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,340
by adding something in the dye.

553
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,340
We can't take it here.

554
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,340
Let's go!

555
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Yu!

556
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,340
What did you find here?

557
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,340
Did you have something to do with the Ghost-Riding?

558
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,340
You've been following us all the time.

559
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,340
Do you really think I'll let you go?

560
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,340
Just this time,

561
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,340
I can tell you everything I have.

562
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,340
You've been thinking about something.

563
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,340
My father and I are different.

564
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,340
I'm not interested in the Ghost-Riding.

565
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,340
I'm interested in the Ghost-Riding.

566
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,340
I'm interested in the Ghost-Riding.

567
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,340
I'm not interested in the Ghost-Riding.

568
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,340
Just tell me everything you know.

569
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,340
The Ghost-Riding

570
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,340
The Ghost-Riding

571
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,340
The Ghost-Riding

572
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,340
The Ghost-Riding

573
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,340
The Ghost-Riding

574
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,340
The Ghost-Riding
