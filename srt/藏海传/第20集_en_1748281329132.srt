00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
Episode 19

2
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:57,000
If there are guests, tell them to stay in the

3
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,760
My Lord-

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm here to pay my respects to Your Highness

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,320
I've passed the memorial yesterday

6
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Where's Lord Zhang? Please come with me

7
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,000
Today, Your Highness said you came from the west

8
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
so you only opened the west gate

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Your Highness is so particular about fengshui

10
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm here to pay my respects to Your Highness

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Lord Zhang, please

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Please wait here

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The memorial will be passed on in a flash

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Lord Zhang, please write your birthday on the paper

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Your Highness will read it later

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is the sea of Tibet

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's interesting

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Your Excellency, my name is Zhang Huai

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm the director of the department

21
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Who is Lord Zhang?

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I am

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm Shen Yong, the governor of Guanglu City

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Please come to the front hall

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Please follow me

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm the director of the department

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm the director of the department

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Please follow me

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your Highness

30
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm here to pay my respects to Your Highness

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sea of Tibet

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We finally meet

33
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've been thinking about the imperial mausoleum

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I thought you were a vicious beast

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
who was in the form of a woman

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and a man who was not seen by His Majesty

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But I read your character

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't expect you to be a noble person

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're a man of the imperial family

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're in danger

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's interesting

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No wonder you're so fast

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I heard that recently

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
the new officials have been in the fire

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and the sun is setting

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You really killed me

47
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're a noble person

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How can I be called noble by you?

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But you make me curious

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You look like a lowly person

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
with such a fate

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let me guess

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is it your fate

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that has been touched by others?

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm not a lowly person

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm a man of the imperial family

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm a man of the imperial family

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I did die in the two-star

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and die alone in the imperial mausoleum

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But it's not a full-fledged death

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I was framed in the imperial mausoleum

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You dare to deceive the emperor

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and kill the emperor

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I won't wrong you

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you, Your Highness

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is my small gift

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Please accept it

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're so good at

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
collecting information

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and you're so rare

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What's more, you're so well-mannered

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How did you get it?

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This is a rare treasure

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I also got it

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
from a businessman

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
who was traveling south to north

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm here to reward you

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a good news

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But I like it

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Say it

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you want?

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're too kind

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I heard that you're a rare and elegant person

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I've been hoping to see you

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Your Highness, please give me some advice

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Advice?

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're from Pingjing

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't you know it's a big deal?

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Say it

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're so clever

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why are you so dumb

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
in my eyes?

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're the best

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I was waiting for you

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and saw you

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I was worried that

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the gift I gave you

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
wouldn't be accepted

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Now you like it

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm so lucky

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I shouldn't have any negative thoughts

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Please forgive me

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Go away

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Go away

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You know how to ask for forgiveness?

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're so kind

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I've sent many people

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
to my mansion

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If they accept any gift

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
what will happen to my mansion?

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But none of them

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
could have given me

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
any gift

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're the one

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
hiding it

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why?

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You want to release Changxian

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and make a big deal out of it

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I wouldn't dare

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
To be honest

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I've been in Qingtian

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and I've seen the dangerous road

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm afraid that one day

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll be a bad person

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I want to make friends

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and see the world

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You should have said it earlier

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're an official in the capital

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I've been asking for

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you to do everything

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
for me

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Why are you still kneeling?

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Shen You, help Lord Zang up

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Lord Zang

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Tell me

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm a man of elegance

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But I like

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
these things with the same smell

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why are you so elegant?

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I've been walking

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and I saw the flowers and trees

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
in your yard

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They're all elegant

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Like the Hu Yang tree

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
which was born and never died

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's like a dragon

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm afraid that one tree

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
can last me ten years

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You have a good eye

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I've sent people

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to bring back that tree

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I brought it back alive

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It took a lot of effort

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But when others came

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
they were curious about

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
why I put a dead tree in the yard

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There are not many people

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
who know the trouble like you

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm the regent of Qingtian

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
look after myself

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and think I've grown up

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I didn't expect

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'd come to your mansion today

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and realize that I'm a gold digger

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're so well-educated

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I like the gift you gave me

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But how to give a gift

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
depends on the culture

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can teach you a way

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Shen You, here

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Today, Lord Zang

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
gave you the real通宝

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Shen You

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You have a good hand

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Lord Zang

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This real通宝

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
was sent by Lord Zang

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's said to be a treasure

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't read it

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why don't you

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
give me something

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to exchange for the quality

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Look at your greed

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll take it for free

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Look

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
you're not

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
coming to my castle

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're friends with Lord Shen

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm so happy

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to have such a treasure

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'll drink more tonight

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Shen You

201
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Since your new friend

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
wants to see the world

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
why don't you invite him

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
to the banquet tonight

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and have a talk

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You're right

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Lord Zang

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Would you like to go with me?

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Thank you

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But

212
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you look a little

213
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
cold

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Shen You, go get

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
some good clothes for Lord Zang

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Congratulations

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
to Lord Zang

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This is not an ordinary banquet

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
After tonight

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you'll be different from before

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The Lord's banquet is once every three years

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and it never

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
takes place in the same place

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If it weren't for the Lord's banquet

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
who else would

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
have built the whole building?

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm afraid you don't know

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
many people who came today

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let me introduce you

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you, Lord Shen

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The one on the left

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is Minister of Rites, Huang Shen

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and Lord Huang

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Except for the Lord

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
he's the only one here

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The one beside Lord Huang is

238
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the right-hand man of Huguang Department

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They're from the same hometown

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The one on the right

241
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
is the Minister of Rites, Wang Shiqui

242
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The one beside Lord Wang

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
is the left-hand man of Dingzhou Department

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Li Fu

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What are they talking about?

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Are they asking Lord Huang

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
to transfer him back to the capital?

248
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
As the saying goes, the emperor is far away

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The high-ranking officials in the capital

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
are like clouds

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The local officials can take their own land

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
as the highest rank

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm afraid the Lord will leave the capital

254
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and leave the country

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He only wants to eat chicken

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
not be a slave

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Lord Zang, with your words

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
it's not like you just joined the officialdom

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No wonder the Lord

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
admires you so much

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You're too kind

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The Lord is here

263
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The Lord is here

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Greetings, Lord

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Everyone is here

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Lord Wang

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The one who came with us

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is the Minister of Rites, Wang Shiqui

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Lord Wang

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Sorry to keep you waiting

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let me introduce

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
a man with a bright future

273
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The right-hand man of Qingtian Sword, Zang Hai

274
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He's quite capable

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm Zang Hai

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Thank you for your kindness, Lord

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm lucky to meet you today

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I've read Lord Zang's memorial

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sure it's a great achievement

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You'd better be careful

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
today

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Don't offend Lord Zang

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I dare not

284
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
In terms of martial arts

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm really lucky

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Zang Hai

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We're all officials of the same dynasty

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They're close to me

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You're new to the officialdom

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't bother me in the future

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
should bother them

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
more

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you, Lord

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
All right

296
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't bother me

297
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Just have fun

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Come on

299
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sure you've met the Emperor

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The first toast

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
is to the Emperor

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
May the Emperor be healthy

303
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and hope you can work together

304
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to share my brother's burden

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Please

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Please

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Lord Zang

308
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The Prince has been

309
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
fighting against me

310
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You're so capable

311
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and good at

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
comparing Chu Huai Ming to him

313
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's all Chu Huai Ming's

314
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
own fault

315
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He can't do

316
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
his own thing

317
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He can't do

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
his own thing

319
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sure

320
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
he's a good person

321
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He can't do

322
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
his own thing

323
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and he wants to hurt others

324
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
If he had

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
surrendered to me

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
he wouldn't have ended up like this

327
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But

328
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't think I can look up to him

329
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Your Highness

330
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Is there a problem

331
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
with the position of

332
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the imperial guard?

333
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Chu Huai Ming has no good ending

334
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
How about

335
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Lord Zhang

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
makes sense

337
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Have you forgotten

338
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
who was the imperial guard

339
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
before Chu Huai Ming?

340
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Kuai Duo

341
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
is a capable person

342
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He's dead

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Zeng Hai, don't panic

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Or

345
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
you can consider

346
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Lord Zhang's position

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll pick one for you

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Thank you, Your Highness

349
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But I

350
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
have feelings for Qing Tian Sword

351
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I just heard

352
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
about Lord Kuai

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I never heard of it

354
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Your Highness

355
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
can you tell me about it?

356
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Lord Kuai's case

357
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
you really want to know?

358
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I have to find a way

359
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
to avoid harm

360
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Harm?

361
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He's different from Chu Huai Ming

362
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He didn't happen

363
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
in the court

364
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
but his family was killed

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How could this happen?

366
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Why did the people I met today

367
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
never mention it to me?

368
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You just became the imperial guard

369
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Who would

370
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
talk about this with you?

371
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Kuai Duo

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
was supposed to

373
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
repair the fan table in the east

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But he didn't finish

375
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The fan table

376
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
collapsed

377
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He sneaked back to

378
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
the capital's house

379
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but was killed by bandits

380
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The whole family

381
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
was burned

382
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and no one survived

383
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Lord Kuai

384
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
did this

385
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
According to your opinion

386
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the enemy killed him

387
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Lord Cang is smart

388
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I think so

389
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I investigated this case

390
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Kuai Duo's family

391
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
was robbed

392
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and the bandits

393
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
were arrested

394
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and they were convicted

395
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This case is over

396
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What about the bandits?

397
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Some of them are not dead

398
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But Lord Kuai

399
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
is a high-ranking witness

400
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There are many people

401
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
who are responsible for this

402
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
At that time, it was

403
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Zhao, the deputy minister of the Ministry of Revenue

404
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Please take care of this case

405
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We can't let anyone escape

406
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and kill them all

407
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Lord

408
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I have a question

409
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't understand

410
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Since all the people of Kuai

411
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
were burned

412
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
How can we be sure

413
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
that Lord Kuai

414
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
came back from the east?

415
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Zhang Hai

416
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You seem to be

417
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
very interested in this case

418
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Lord

419
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm afraid of death

420
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I have to think of a way

421
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What if

422
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
what if the feng shui of Qingtian Sword is wrong?

423
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
How can we say this

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
in such a good day?

425
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Who is the one to be beheaded?

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Lord, you don't talk about Kuai Duo

427
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Who dares to say?

428
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Look at my memory

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'll give you a drink

430
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Come on, let's fill it

431
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Come on, fill it

432
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Lord Jin

433
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Lord Jin

434
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Shen You

435
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Lord

436
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Didn't you say

437
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you invited the flower kui from the capital today?

438
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Why haven't you arrived yet?

439
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I've been waiting for a long time

440
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The flower kui is for seeing the prince

441
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So I have to dress up

442
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well

443
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'll wait

444
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
in case I rush too much

445
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and make the flower kui

446
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
into a big flower face

447
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Wow

448
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
odynamics

449
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Ok

450
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,880
Good.

451
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,960
My Lord.

452
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,240
My master doesn't want us here today.

453
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,720
I'd like to proceed well with you.

454
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,960
I specially invite you to offer

455
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,440
this Meijing, whichㅋㅋㅋㅋ

456
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
This wine is called Sanglu

457
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
The wine is so good

458
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Good wine

459
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Prince, what is this wine?

460
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Fragrant

461
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,440
Prince, can you give me a taste?

462
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Don't even think about it

463
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,440
This wine is not enough for you

464
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
Ok

465
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
We have talked about the idle things today

466
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,440
Take all the treasures you have prepared

467
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
If you have something I like

468
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
You can change it from me

469
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
to this Sangluo wine

470
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Lord Zang

471
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Every time the prince gives a speech

472
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
he will have a habit of seeing the treasure

473
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
If there is something the prince can like

474
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
You can change it from him

475
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
to something else

476
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
The money is not the only thing you can change

477
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
It's not that simple

478
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Jade dragon

479
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
You have a good taste

480
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Say it

481
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Reward

482
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
Prince, I have a rare item recently

483
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Open it

484
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Yes

485
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Prince, please look

486
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,440
What is so special about this item?

487
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,440
It is said that it is what the Yin soldiers wear

488
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Yin soldiers?

489
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Yin soldiers are not only in the legend

490
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
but also in this

491
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
I also got this by accident

492
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
I don't know much about it

493
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Prince

494
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
I know a little

495
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
I once heard from an old man

496
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
who came back from the border

497
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,440
that the Yin soldiers only have flesh and no blood

498
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Even if the sword is cut

499
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,440
the wound will heal quickly

500
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
The army is too close

501
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
The line of sight is too far

502
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,440
The line of sight is too far

503
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
It is said that they came back from the border

504
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
because of a treasure

505
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Treasure?

506
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
Zang Hai

507
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,440
The treasure you are talking about

508
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,440
is the ghost blood, right?

509
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Ghost blood?

510
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
So this treasure is called ghost blood

511
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
The old man said he had never seen it

512
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
and he said that the people he had seen

513
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,440
were all dead

514
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
But how did Prince know?

515
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Prince, you are right

516
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I have seen it before

517
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
I have seen it before

518
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
But how did Prince know?

519
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,440
My father died because of ghost blood

520
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Prince, why are you all so nervous?

521
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,440
The late emperor didn't die because of the Yin soldiers

522
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,440
He was just worried about the war

523
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,440
I have never seen this ghost blood

524
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
I am also very curious

525
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Li Fu

526
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Prince

527
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
In my opinion

528
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
this thing is no different from the hat of the Eastern Xia soldiers

529
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,440
It is as interesting as what Mr. Zang said

530
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Yes

531
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,440
I have seen it before

532
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Okay

533
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,440
I have seen all your things

534
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
But I don't have this treasure

535
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
that I like

536
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Look

537
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
Before the truce

538
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
there was one more in the auction

539
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
I asked someone to buy it

540
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
but someone took it

541
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
I heard that it cost a lot of money

542
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
I am still angry

543
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
but today

544
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I have got this

545
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Do you think I am a lucky man?

546
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,440
A lucky man

547
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Yes, a lucky man

548
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Yes

549
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,440
I have to thank Mr. Zang for this

550
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Mr. Zang

551
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
for the reward

552
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Thank you, Prince

553
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Mr. Zang

554
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
I wish you a happy marriage

555
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Thank you, Miss

556
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Zang Hai

557
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
I have been waiting for you

558
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
I am here

559
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
I am here

560
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,440
I am here

561
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I am here

562
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
I am here

563
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Zang Hai

564
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
How does it taste?

565
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Your Highness

566
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
This wine

567
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
is very good

568
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
but it is too spicy

569
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,440
I can't drink it

570
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,440
You are

571
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,440
a lucky man

572
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,440
Your Highness

573
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,440
It is unfair

574
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Who doesn't know that your favorite is the jade

575
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
We have to use this wine

576
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,440
to make other things

577
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Your Highness

578
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
This wine

579
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
I

580
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
drink too much

581
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,440
today

582
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,440
I can't drink it

583
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,440
Brother

584
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Come

585
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,440
Help me to take a rest

586
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Be careful

587
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Wait

588
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
I can't

589
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
My darling

590
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,280
Slow down

591
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,080
Don't steal my wine

592
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,000
I dare not

593
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,840
Go

594
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,480
Take care, Your Highness

595
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,320
Miss Xiao

596
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,200
Lord Zang, drink

597
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,840
Miss Xiao, why are you...

598
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,440
What?

599
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,720
You think my wine is not as good as your wine?

600
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,480
I didn't mean that

601
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
Then do you want to drink?

602
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,400
You are so popular at the banquet today

603
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,840
My Gu Beisai is so popular

604
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,320
I'm so happy to see you

605
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm so happy to see you

606
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
I'm so happy to see you

607
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,960
My Gu Beisai helped me a lot

608
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,280
Thank you for helping me, Miss Xiao

609
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,080
But I need to make it clear

610
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,240
I didn't sell this Gu Beisai to you

611
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,720
nor give it to you

612
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,480
Now you have the love of His Highness

613
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,400
You should return it to its owner

614
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,080
OK

615
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,680
Lord Zang

616
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,360
Lord Shen

617
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,160
Lord exactly

618
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,640
Lord Shen

619
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,760
Lord Shen

620
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,360
Lord Zang

621
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,880
Your Majesty

622
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,560
Your Majesty

623
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,600
Lord Shen

624
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,400
Lord Shen

625
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,960
Lord Zang

626
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,160
No

627
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,560
You can't look down on me

628
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,760
Now I want to drink

629
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Your Highness, wake up.

630
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,760
Continue drinking.

631
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,560
Drink? I can't drink anymore.

632
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,360
Your Highness, you're back at home.

633
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,960
Let me help you go to bed and rest.

634
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,960
No need. I'll just stay here.

635
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,560
Your Highness, your ghost wedding is lost.

636
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Ghost wedding?

637
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,160
Ghost wedding?

638
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,960
Where? Where?

639
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,760
But, Zang Daren, His Highness really likes you.

640
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,760
He even gave you wine.

641
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,360
But this wine is really good.

642
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,160
I've never seen His Highness get drunk so quickly.

643
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,760
How is His Highness now?

644
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,960
It's fine. I just gave him a secret antidote.

645
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,560
Just take a few sips and he'll wake up.

646
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,760
You really haven't seen a ghost wedding?

647
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Sheng Zheng.

648
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Who are you?

649
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,760
I'm here to serve His Highness.

650
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,960
You were talking to me just now.

651
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,960
What are you doing?

652
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Tell me, what did you do just now?

653
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,160
What is this?

654
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,360
You've forgotten the three-dollar bill on the table.

655
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,160
If I lose this, where else can I find another?

656
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,360
I really drank too much today.

657
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,560
Why are you still standing there?

658
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,760
Hurry and go and change His Highness's bed sheet.

659
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,560
Hurry and go!

660
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,160
You Zang Hai.

661
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,760
You've found me another three-dollar bill.

662
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,960
Then, Your Highness, why don't you reward me with another cup of your beauty wine?

663
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,560
When I was drinking the first cup, I was being laughed at.

664
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,360
How am I supposed to...

665
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,160
I have to find my life back, right?

666
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Reward.

667
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,160
Thank you, Your Highness. Then, I'll go get the wine.

668
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,360
Wait.

669
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Just now, someone was asking me something.

670
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,560
I saw Shen Yong just now and he went back from your place.

671
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,760
Could it be that Lord Shen told you about him?

672
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,960
No. It's a woman.

673
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,760
A woman?

674
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,360
What are you saying?

675
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960
Your Highness, you're drunk.

676
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,760
Get out of my way!

677
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,360
Your Highness, I'm here.

678
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,760
You're really good at playing tricks.

679
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,160
You didn't say how long you were here and you forgot about me so soon.

680
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,760
Which flower basket is mine that has such a big shelf?

681
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,760
So it's the sixth flower basket.

682
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,160
Your Highness, you're having a banquet at the pillow house today.

683
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,760
Can I not come and have some fun?

684
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,960
Your Highness, I was asking you earlier which clothes you like me to wear.

685
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
You wanted to see which dance I dance to.

686
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,360
But you didn't even say a word.

687
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,760
Really?

688
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,960
I didn't tell you beforehand that I was here today.

689
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,560
You won't blame me, right?

690
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,160
You gave me such a big surprise.

691
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,760
How can I blame you?

692
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,160
Sixth Uncle, let me introduce you.

693
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,360
This is a new friend of mine.

694
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,960
He's...

695
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,160
I'm Qing Tianjian, the vassal.

696
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,360
Oh, no.

697
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,160
Wu Yan is really handsome.

698
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,960
I've met Sixth Miss.

699
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,760
Miss?

700
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,960
I haven't heard anyone call me that in so many years.

701
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,360
It's really very fresh.

702
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,560
Your Highness, I especially prepared a new flower.

703
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,960
Why don't you give it a try?

704
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,360
Sure, Sixth Miss.

705
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,560
I've always heard that Miss is very suit for pretty curves.

706
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,960
We also kokomgasps for Miss to be pretty.

707
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,760
What's with the civil preparations for Mr. Ye?

708
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,960
You seem to be very interested in Kuai Duo's death.

709
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,440
You're talking about the protection of Ghostly Joy, right?

710
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,480
My father died because of Ghostly Joy.

711
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,800
I also haven't seen Ghostly Joy myself.

712
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,400
I'm also very curious.

713
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Ghostly Joy

714
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,360
You're awake.

715
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,360
What did you say?

716
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,960
You drank so much.

717
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,560
You don't even remember how you got on the carriage, right?

718
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,760
It's a pity that we talked so much.

719
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,560
I still can't be sure if Yong Rong is the third person.

720
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,360
He isn't. You don't need to investigate anymore.

721
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,560
Because when your family was in trouble, the prince was at the banquet.

722
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,960
It was at my house, the night when the door was closed.

723
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,960
It's been so many years.

724
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,960
I still remember the big fire that night.

725
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,160
The banquet was set on a painting room.

726
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,960
I was there too.

727
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,560
Everyone was in a trance.

728
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,960
The painting room followed the wide river and went north-east.

729
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
It was only until dawn that it was over.

730
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,360
It was still the prince who first discovered

731
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,760
the red sky and the red sky.

732
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,960
That's why everyone went out to see it.

733
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,960
That means that the people who went to the banquet

734
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,960
couldn't have been part of our family.

735
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,360
That's right.

736
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,960
When Gao Mingyi told me that you were visiting the prince,

737
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
I quickly thought of a way to come over.

738
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,360
So you wouldn't waste your time.

739
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,960
It's all thanks to me.

740
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,760
I came to save you.

741
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,360
I'll go now.

742
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,560
This is for your acupuncture.

743
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,360
Soak it in and take it.

744
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,960
Okay.

745
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,560
Good thing you informed me.

746
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,360
Or else, I'm afraid that he can't get through today's situation.

747
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,120
After all, he had an accident in advance

748
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,120
He hasn't prepared for many things

749
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,440
Yes

750
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,200
If he is like you

751
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,720
he will be fine

752
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,960
Of course

753
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
I am his master

754
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
I am leaving

755
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,160
You are leaving now?

756
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,880
My master

757
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,120
You are here

758
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,800
Here

759
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
Here

760
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,200
Han

761
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,320
Master, come in

762
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,200
You are here

763
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,040
I made porridge for you

764
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,480
Come

765
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,440
Thank you, master

766
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,320
You're awake, aren't you?

767
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,040
You didn't say anything

768
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,080
when you came back last night.

769
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,480
I was worried that you would wake up

770
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,680
and forget everything.

771
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,760
Did you gain anything?

772
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,720
I suspected Prince Yongrong

773
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,760
the whole night yesterday.

774
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,240
But Master Six's words

775
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,760
made me give up completely.

776
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,480
But

777
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,320
you mentioned someone

778
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,880
at the banquet yesterday.

779
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,960
I was a little concerned.

780
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,160
Who?

781
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,440
Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Revenue,

782
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,600
Zhao Mianwen.

783
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,120
Is there something wrong with him?

784
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,600
He didn't have direct contact

785
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,840
with Mianwen.

786
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,080
But after that,

787
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,480
he reported to His Majesty

788
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,560
and severely punished the murderer.

789
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,640
In the end, those bandits

790
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,320
were killed.

791
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,760
Those bandits

792
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,280
were either bribed

793
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,560
or beaten to death.

794
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,040
No matter which kind,

795
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,400
as long as there is a living person,

796
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,280
the truth will be revealed.

797
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,400
But Minister Zhao did this

798
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
for a reason.

799
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,440
My father is a righteous man.

800
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,560
It's normal for officials

801
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,240
to make a contribution.

802
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,200
But

803
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,480
as long as there is a third person

804
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,720
who can cover up the truth,

805
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,800
I don't want to let it go.

806
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,280
I don't want to let it go.

807
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,480
I don't want to let it go.

808
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,800
Yes.

809
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,440
After all, this is the only

810
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,960
clue we can find now.

811
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,400
It seems that

812
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,160
I have to find a way

813
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,320
to see His Majesty.

814
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,720
Even if the knife is sharp,

815
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,160
it won't hurt.

816
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,040
Because

817
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,960
my heart is burning.

818
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,360
I am the one who is in the clouds.

819
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,960
I am the one who is in the clouds.

820
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,080
I am the one who is willful.

821
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,480
I will always remember

822
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,760
the past.

823
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,240
I am the one who is in the clouds.

824
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,000
I am the one who is willful.

825
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,520
When the sun rises, it's like the sun sets.

826
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,120
I sing with the military.

827
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,280
I am the one who is in the clouds.

828
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,760
I am the one who is willful.

829
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,480
I am the one who is willful.

830
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,760
The world is me.

831
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,000
The world is me.

832
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,760
You are me too.
