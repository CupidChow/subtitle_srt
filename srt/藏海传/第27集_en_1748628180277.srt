Mom.

I'm hungry.

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
You're hungry again?

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Mom, the ginger tea is ready.

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Drink it to warm your body.

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Fu'er is hungry.

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Hurry and feed her some food.

I'm not hungry.

00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
I'm not hungry.

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Hurry and feed her some food.

Here.

28
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
I want more.

00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
I want more.

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yue Rou.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come here.

33
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Send this bowl of ginger tea to your uncle first.

34
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Go.

35
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Okay.

36
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Come.

37
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
It's getting cold.

38
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,000
All the servants in the house are gone.

39
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I cooked it myself.

40
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Uncle, drink it while it's hot.

41
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Okay.

42
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Mother, I want to eat milk cake again.

43
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Drink this bowl of soup first.

44
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
But medicine.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not sick.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why do I need medicine?

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's not you who's sick.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's everyone who's sick.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is my father also sick?

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Is my mother also sick?

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Your father...

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He's angry at us.

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Mother is very angry.

54
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
So he got sick.

55
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Now the whole family is not sick.

56
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
But I don't regret at all.

57
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Because everything has become easier.

58
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
It's become simple.

59
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Okay.

60
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Mother.

61
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
I'll drink it.

62
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Drink it.

63
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Drink it.

64
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Mother.

65
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I've finished drinking.

66
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I'll drink it too.

67
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Drink it.

68
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
I'll be better.

69
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
I'll drink it too.

70
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Drink it.

71
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Yue Rou.

72
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Did Jiang Cha send it?

73
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Yes.

74
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
I even left you a bowl.

75
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Drink it while it's hot.

76
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Okay.

77
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
I'll drink it.

78
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
I'll drink it.

79
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
I'll drink it.

80
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Come.

81
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Give me the report.

82
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Zhuang Jiang and Zhuang Zhi Fu are dead.

83
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Yes.

84
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Let's go.

85
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Your Majesty.

86
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
The death of Zhuang Jiang and Zhuang Zhi Fu

87
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
at the Imperial Household Department

88
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
is imminent.

89
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Did Zhang Lu Yin know?

90
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Your Majesty.

91
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
He doesn't know yet.

92
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Many people have persuaded me

93
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
to kill Zhuang Lu Yin.

94
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
What do you think?

95
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Your Majesty.

96
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Zhuang Lu Yin is very cunning

97
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
and controls military affairs at the border.

98
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
He's not allowed to live.

99
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Your Majesty.

100
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Zhuang's army has contributed to the country.

101
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
If we kill Zhuang Lu Yin like this,

102
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm afraid it will be a shame

103
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
to the soldiers.

104
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Your Majesty.

105
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Zhuang's army has contributed to the country.

106
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
If we kill Zhuang Lu Yin like this,

107
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm afraid it will be a shame

108
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
to the soldiers.

109
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
So what if we have contributed?

110
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
What I'm afraid of is to give up.

111
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Your Majesty.

112
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
If we don't succeed this time,

113
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
we will have endless trouble.

114
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
By the order of the Emperor of Tiancheng,

115
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Zhuang Lu Yin

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
was sent to the Qing court

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to take over the power of the Ming Dynasty

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and to hold the meeting.

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He sold his official position

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and killed five soldiers.

121
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He was killed by the army.

122
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He is ungrateful and ungrateful.

123
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He is not a courtier.

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He is obvious and obvious.

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He will be removed from the throne

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
as a scholar.

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He will be removed from the throne

128
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and be sent to the county of Zhang.

129
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's all.

130
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Where is my family?

131
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
A few people have met

132
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
in Zhuang's mansion.

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Yesterday, Fu Du committed suicide.

134
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
He died this morning.

135
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Where is the Crown Prince?

136
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
The Crown Prince is in the Marquis' mansion.

137
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
He will be released in the future.

138
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Marquis,

139
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
please rest in peace.

140
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Let's have dinner.

153
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Zhuang Luoyun.

154
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
What are you doing?

155
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,800
Master, I'm sorry.

156
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm here to accompany you.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
Are you crazy?

158
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,440
My Lord, you killed me.

159
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,640
You know you can't get out.

160
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,720
I can give you wealth and glory

161
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,680
if I don't kill you.

162
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,880
Send me a letter.

163
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,800
I need to kill you to send me a letter.

164
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,680
I'll kill you now.

165
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,600
Send me a letter.

166
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,320
I'll send you a letter.

167
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,840
Help me send the letter to Eunuch Cao.

168
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,880
If you can't do it,

169
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I'll find a way to make you die.

170
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,480
I see.

171
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,520
Go.

172
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,840
Where are you going?

173
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,880
None of your business.

174
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
You were sneaking around

175
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,600
in front of Eunuch Cao's mansion.

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,440
What do you think?

177
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,200
My Lord, I'm sorry.

178
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,040
I didn't mean to...

179
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,280
I didn't mean to...

180
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,120
You're Eunuch Cao's guard.

181
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,960
Cut the crap.

182
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,160
Tell me the truth.

183
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,400
Why did you go to Eunuch Cao's mansion?

184
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,280
My Lord,

185
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm the old man who's looking after Tian Qingtong.

186
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,000
Please let me send Eunuch Cao a letter.

187
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,000
A letter?

188
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,240
Where's the letter?

189
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,720
It's with me.

190
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,000
Take it out.

191
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,480
You don't want to live?

192
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,280
My Lord.

193
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,520
My Lord.

194
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,440
It's a blood letter.

195
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,240
All right, go back.

196
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,400
We'll give it to Eunuch Cao.

197
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,120
Go back.

198
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,960
Go back.

199
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Please forgive me.

200
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,120
I have to give it to Eunuch Cao.

201
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
I have no choice.

202
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,680
Since it's a letter for Eunuch Cao,

203
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,360
we won't make it hard for you.

204
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,120
Thank you, My Lord.

205
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,480
Let's go.

206
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,800
Hurry up.

207
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Come on.

208
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,840
It's done.

209
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,240
You and I were all fooled by Zang Hai.

210
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,960
He's the son of the Housekeeper.

211
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Come and see me.

212
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,120
I did what Zang Hai expected.

213
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll be fine.

214
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,600
I'll be back to my position.

215
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,640
Or the Emperor will know

216
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,040
about the Housekeeper.

217
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,720
Where did you get the letter?

218
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,280
Someone came to me

219
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
and said he was in charge of guarding

220
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,320
Zhuang Luyin's family.

221
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,760
He sent a letter to my father.

222
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,320
Family?

223
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,920
Yes.

224
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,880
I checked it.

225
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,320
It's really the family's house.

226
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,960
Zhuang Luyin told him

227
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,080
if he didn't send it,

228
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
he would be killed.

229
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,640
Zhuang Luyin should be the one who should be killed.

230
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,280
Should I do it now?

231
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,800
No.

232
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,200
Now everyone knows

233
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,560
I want Zhuang Luyin's life.

234
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,720
If he dies in the prison,

235
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,680
I will definitely be involved.

236
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,280
Zhuang Luyin.

237
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,520
You want to use this

238
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,560
to threaten me?

239
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,440
It seems you already know

240
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,360
you can't live long.

241
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,600
Since you don't tolerate it,

242
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,920
don't blame me.

243
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,120
Lu Ran.

244
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,600
Yes.

245
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,520
You imitate Zhuang Luyin's handwriting

246
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,480
and write a letter.

247
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,920
Ask someone to be the imperial family

248
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,840
and send it to Mu Jinying.

249
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,240
Give it to Zhang Lang.

250
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,240
Father, you're so smart.

251
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,600
We should help His Majesty

252
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,640
to get rid of the trouble.

253
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,640
What did the Marquis say?

254
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,560
He said he was killed by the enemy.

255
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,600
At this time,

256
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,040
we should go to rescue him.

257
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,720
It's the Marquis' handwriting.

258
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,040
Zhang Mao.

259
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,480
Take 50 brothers to kill the Marquis

260
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,480
with their head-shakes,

261
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,440
disguise themselves,

262
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,400
and kill them in the prison.

263
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,280
To get rid of the Marquis.

264
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,840
Yes.

265
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,640
Lan Yongqi.

266
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Take 80 men to take the streets.

267
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,320
Make sure the city gates are opened.

268
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,120
Yes.

269
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,200
I'll take 300 men to wait outside the city.

270
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,160
If anything happens,

271
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,640
set the fire as a sign.

272
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,720
I'll lead the army to kill the enemy.

273
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,560
Go.

274
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,240
Yes.

275
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,520
You've done a good job.

276
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,760
The Marquis said he would reward you.

277
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,720
Right?

278
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,560
Yes.

279
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,440
He said he would reward you when he sent the letter.

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,320
Take him to receive the reward.

281
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,560
Thank you, General.

282
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:01,880
Go, go.

283
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,040
Why are you here suddenly?

284
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Why don't you talk when you're here?

285
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Let me sit here for a while, okay?

286
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,520
When father is not home, you should listen to your mother and take care of your sister.

287
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,520
You can use RI straight recovery vines.

288
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,840
When father is back, I can make a bigger one for you,

289
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
can't I?

290
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,460
I'm crying my eyes out tonight,

291
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,540
the worstPressure at home,

292
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
I will die of juego.

293
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,520
The Great Wall of Changdao

294
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,120
The Great Wall of Changdao

295
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,520
is the most powerful in the East of the Yangtze River.

296
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,760
The sun rises and sets, the horses ride and the dragon roams.

297
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,920
Looking at the mountains and rivers in the palace,

298
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,000
carriage vessels and

299
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,780
strike ger cinema are

300
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,880
forever.

301
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,840
Our Army is like the Valentine Ã¶

302
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,800
traditional adjusted sharp sword

303
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,080
to sword passed

304
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:21,760
on to pass.

305
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,740
the

306
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,960
Great eunuchs

307
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,000
Alright, guys

308
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,240
Follow me and save the Marquis

309
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,700
Firstly, the

310
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,800
Greatjaun is Ñ€ proves

um room

312
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,140
led by the gold t ë§Œë“¤ by the thousand and a Go migration

313
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,360
we came to.\ until we reached the mountain,

314
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,700
with a fast lifting kind enough to make a man happy,

315
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Father, the people of Muji Camp have entered the capital

316
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,380
and sing the song of the five-storied tree

317
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,380
I have followed your order

318
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,380
and dispatched the heavy troops of the heavy rain

319
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,380
Within one week

320
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,380
they can save Zhuang Luyin

321
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Where is Zhuang Zhixing?

322
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,380
Luyin has gone

323
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,380
You mean

324
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,380
you want Zhuang Zhixing and Zhuang Luyin to meet

325
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
I want to get rid of him

326
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,380
Zhuang Luyin is a traitor

327
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,380
How can his son

328
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,380
stand out?

329
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,380
Who?

330
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
Who is outside?

331
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
Go

332
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
Go

333
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,380
My lord

334
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,380
My lord

335
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,380
I am late

336
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,380
Zhang Meng

337
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,380
Zhang Meng

338
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,380
Who sent you?

339
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,380
We got the news from my lord

340
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,380
and came immediately

341
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,380
My lord, thank you

342
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,380
Who sent you the letter?

343
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,380
It's the imperial clan of Kangya

344
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,380
They have been killed

345
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
My lord, what's wrong?

346
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
What's wrong?

347
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
I sent Cao Jingxian

348
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,380
but you came

349
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
My lord

350
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,380
You asked us to come

351
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,380
Is it a trap?

352
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,380
His majesty left me a life

353
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,380
I will die if you come

354
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,380
My lord

355
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,380
What should we do now?

356
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,380
How many people did you bring?

357
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,380
Lan Yongji has led 80 people to the city

358
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
to wait for the response

359
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
Zhang Lang led 300 people to guard the city

360
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,380
and wait for your order

361
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,380
So far

362
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,380
there is only one way

363
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,380
to survive

364
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,380
We will serve you to death

365
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
OK

366
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,380
You follow me to the city

367
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,380
and ask the military to investigate

368
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,380
and find out the truth

369
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
Yes

370
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,380
Kill

371
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,380
We are here

372
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,380
We are here

373
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
Tell Lan Yongji and Zhang Lang

374
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,380
to meet at once

375
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,380
Yes

376
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,380
Go

377
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
Brothers

378
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,380
Follow my lord

379
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,380
Charge

380
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,380
Go

381
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
Open the gate

382
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
Yes

383
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,380
Go

384
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Protect the lord

385
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,380
Zhuang Luoyin

386
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,380
What are you doing?

387
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,380
You want to rebel?

388
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,380
I did this for his majesty

389
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
For the country of Dayong

390
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,380
No matter who you are

391
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
Step aside

392
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
Zhuang Luoyin

393
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
wants to rebel

394
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,380
Kill

395
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,380
You want to kill me?

396
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,380
Attack

397
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,380
Kill

398
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,380
Kill them all

399
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,380
One by one

400
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,380
Second brother

401
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,380
Uncle Zhang Lang

402
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,380
Why are you here?

403
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,380
What happened?

404
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,380
I don't have time to explain

405
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,380
Please meet with my lord

406
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,380
Go

407
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,380
Follow me

408
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,380
Go

409
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,380
It's you

410
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
Why are you here?

411
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
Listen

412
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
You go out of the city now

413
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,380
Don't lie in the water

414
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,380
What happened?

415
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
Those soldiers

416
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,380
were from the Mu's army

417
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
They must be here to save your father

418
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,380
There must be a bad battle tonight

419
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,380
And you are here now

420
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,380
It's not a coincidence

421
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,380
Someone came to kill me

422
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,380
I followed him out

423
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,380
and was led here by the fireworks

424
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,380
Cao Jinxian

425
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
He wants you and your father

426
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,380
to die in this bad battle tonight

427
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,380
You leave the capital now

428
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,380
Don't come back

429
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
before things are over

430
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,380
Take it

431
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
Take it

432
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,380
This money

433
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,380
should be enough for you to live outside

434
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,380
Go

435
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
What about my father?

436
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
He has no way to go back

437
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,380
You only have a chance to leave

438
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,380
If you stay in the capital

439
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,380
you will die

440
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,380
Go

441
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
Go

442
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,380
Go

443
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
My lord

444
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,380
I am late

445
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,380
Great

446
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,380
Brothers

447
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,380
I am here

448
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,380
The court is on the run

449
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,380
I was set up

450
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,380
Today

451
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,380
I am lucky to be saved by you

452
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,380
Everyone

453
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,380
Come with me to the capital

454
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,380
to pay the price

455
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,380
Pay the price

456
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,380
Pay the price

457
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
Father

458
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,380
How is the army?

459
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,380
They have sent someone

460
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,380
to report to the imperial clan

461
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
Wang Luoying

462
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,380
You should go to die

463
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,380
I just want to make the emperor

464
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
can't sleep tonight

465
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,380
The emperor is here

466
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,380
Go

467
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,380
Stop

468
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
Stop

469
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
Fire

470
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,380
Kill

471
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,380
Kill

472
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
Kill

473
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
Zhuolongyin

474
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,380
How dare you

475
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
Wait

476
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,380
We are going to the capital

477
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,380
to pay the price

478
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,380
You are going to bring your army

479
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,380
to meet the emperor?

480
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,380
I am not going to see the emperor

481
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,380
I am going to see the emperor

482
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
I am going to see the emperor

483
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,380
Are you here to see the emperor?

484
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,380
You are rebelling

485
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,380
Listen

486
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,380
Take this door

487
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,380
and kill the army

488
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
Kill

489
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,380
Shoot

490
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,380
Kill

491
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,380
Kill

492
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Kill

493
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Kill

494
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,380
Kill

495
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Kill

496
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,380
Your Majesty

497
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,380
Your Majesty

498
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,380
Zhuang Luoying was kidnapped

499
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,380
and brought to the capital

500
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,380
Your Majesty

501
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,380
Your Majesty

502
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,380
Close the gate

503
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,380
Hurry

504
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
Shoot

505
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
Squat

506
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,380

508
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,380
Kill

509
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,380
Kill

510
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,380
Kill

511
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,380
Kill

512
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,380
Kill

513
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,380
Kill

514
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,380
Go

515
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,380
Kill

516
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
Report

517
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,380
Commander Shui

518
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,380
Mu Qiyun's attack is too strong

519
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,380
We are going to be out of control

520
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,380
Let everyone hold on

521
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,380
Attack

522
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
Kill

523
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,380
Kill

524
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,380
Kill

525
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
Break it

526
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Zhuang Luoying

527
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,380
Kill

528
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,380
Kill

529
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,380
Zang Hai

530
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,380
I told you

531
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,380
I will kill you if I go out again

532
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,380
You came to the door yourself

533
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,380
Stop

534
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,380
Stop

535
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,380
Stop

536
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,380
Second young master

537
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,380
Kill

538
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,380
Han Yongqi

539
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,380
Kill

540
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,380
Why did you do this?

541
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,380
Father

542
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,380
Surrender

543
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,380
What did you say?

544
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,380
Do you know the consequences of surrender?

545
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,380
Do you want the Zhuang family to be punished

546
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,380
for being accused of being wronged?

547
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,380
I have no choice

548
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,380
When I enter the palace and see the emperor

549
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,380
I will find a way to explain to him

550
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,380
What does my father do to the Suosuo?

551
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,380
The Zhuang family is heavily attacked

552
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,380
You are insisting on making Suosuo ashamed

553
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,380
Let the Zhuang family be punished

554
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,380
I really saw it wrong

555
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,380
You are still that coward

556
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,380
You either rush in with me

557
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,380
Or

558
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,380
Get out of my way

559
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,380
Father

560
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,380
You are forcing the emperor to attack

561
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,380
No matter what

562
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,380
The emperor will not forgive you

563
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,380
If you want to break the city

564
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,380
You can step over my body

565
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,380
Liar

566
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,380
Do you think I dare not?

567
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,380
How dare you betray me?

568
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,380
I am afraid that you will be punished

569
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
I will not let you go

570
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,380
I will not let you go

571
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,380
I will not let you go

572
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,380
I will not let you go

573
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,380
I will not let you go

574
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,380
I will not let you go

575
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,380
I will not let you go

576
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,380
I will not let you go

577
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,380
I will not let you go

578
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,380
I will not let you go

579
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,380
