Lord Zhang

Every year, the year starts

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
His Majesty will open a temple in the palace

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
From the Inner Court to the Ministry of Justice

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to the State Council

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It will be a few days

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I am the Minister of the Ministry of Justice

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and the Minister of the Youth Council

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I will be in the Ministry of Justice

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you going back?

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All the duties I have been in charge

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
have been completed

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I have already said hello to the Inner Court

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I will leave tonight

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Today, on the New Year's Day

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the servants of the House of Ministers

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
have cooked soup

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
for some snacks

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I will still stay here

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and go home to eat

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You have prepared this soup for me

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you, Lord

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tonight, the servants of the Palace

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
will also have a banquet

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can go and have a look

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Even if you can get into the palace

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
can you enter the Han Zhang Hall

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that is in the hands of the guards?

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Every year on the 15th of the month

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
there will be a lot of banquet in the palace

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But tonight

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
His Majesty will not be at the Han Zhang Hall

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
All the places in the capital

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
will also be lit up

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want you to

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
put a great sacrifice

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
in the right time

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
so that the people of the capital

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
will remember this bowl forever

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will go and have a look

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When I light the lantern

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I can't see where it is

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000

I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

216
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

221
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm going to make a little bit of the dough.

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I think this is something that my father cares about me.

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The building here is built by Anzhou, the current capital, and the food.

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But my house has been burned down ten years ago.

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why did it appear here?

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No, there's something wrong with the sign.

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The building is a bit old.

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't know what's going on.

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know what's going on.

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know what's going on.

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know what's going on.

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know what's going on.

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know what's going on.

234
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't know what's going on.

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't know what's going on.

236
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't know what's going on.

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't know what's going on.

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't know what's going on.

239
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't know what's going on.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know what's going on.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know what's going on.

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yan.

243
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Father, why are you so conservative?

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You never know what the wild beast is.

245
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You never know what the wild beast is.

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I hope that you and I will meet in the most dangerous time.

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We will meet in the most dangerous time.

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Road?

249
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So the emperor is a road.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's a road.

251
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And my father is Yan.

252
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yan.

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
My head is already missing some parts.

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,420
These aren't outside, this is mine.

255
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,460
I should never have took them all out so quick.

256
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:46,220
So she was drinking out the sunscreen first and thenion 3 days later.

257
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,060
I have spent 3 or 4 days after Batten,

258
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,560
going through this patreon video powerless launch.

259
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:37,740
Make sure pe

260
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:50,020
you

261
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,520
You

262
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Shi Jie, today's building is so dark and we are sick.

263
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Why are you here?

264
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
We can't do much about it.

265
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
I'm afraid that the building will be too dark.

266
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
So I came to see.

267
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Sir, why are you here?

268
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Today, I was ordered to hurry up and send a batch of stone seal.

269
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
It's urgent.

270
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,520
I'm afraid I'll have to stay here tonight.

271
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
I see.

272
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Sir, let me help you.

273
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
No need.

274
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
You should go back first.

275
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Okay.

276
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Thank you, sir.

277
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Sir, is the table on the table a ghost bath?

278
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Is it a ghost bath?

279
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
It seems that it's a dead body.

280
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Don't move.

281
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
It's all very weird.

282
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Shi Quan, you...

283
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,520
I've waited for this day for so many years.

284
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Let's go.

285
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Who are you?

286
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Sir, you look so sad.

287
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
I forgot to tell you.

288
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
I have another name.

289
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Lu Fen.

290
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
You are Cao Jing Xian?

291
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Yes.

292
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Of course, there must be a lot of doubts.

293
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Sit down and talk.

294
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,520
I'll be sure to keep my word no matter what you ask for.

295
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Sir, please.

296
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
You are Cao Jing Xian.

297
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Why are you in the Sky Sword?

298
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
I've checked you.

299
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
You came to the Sky Sword very early.

300
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,520
The Tian Wen Sheng family of Zhen Shun has been in the dark for ten years.

301
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Don't worry, sir.

302
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
Even if it's a three-way search,

303
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
there won't be any doubts.

304
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Tell me.

305
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
You and Chu Huai Ming are in the same room.

306
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
You must have lied to me.

307
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Cao Jing Xian sent you here to hide.

308
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
To return to the Sky Sword,

309
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
I came to the Sky Sword to serve Father.

310
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
I came to Chu Huai Ming.

311
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,520
He and you are helping Lu Yin to return to the Sky Sword.

312
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
But Chu Huai Ming has been looking for him for ten years.

313
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
He can't even find a shadow.

314
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Father told me to wait here for a while.

315
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,520
He said that the person who asked for the return will never miss the Sky Sword.

316
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Because this place is a place that has been closed for many years.

317
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Father is right.

318
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
You can't just find it.

319
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
You can get it back.

320
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
How do you know that I will do it tonight?

321
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
You are a secret.

322
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
You are a good man.

323
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
But there is a saying.

324
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
The world is hard.

325
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
The world is hard.

326
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
I'm afraid that there will be new people.

327
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
The Sky Sword will be closed tonight.

328
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
The Sky Sword will be completely removed.

329
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
It will be a disease.

330
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Even the confession of the door is written by you.

331
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Isn't it worth thinking about it?

332
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Lu Fen.

333
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
You are hiding it well.

334
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
My younger brother and sister.

335
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
You have seen it.

336
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
My younger brother Lu Ran.

337
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
He has a good mouth.

338
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
He is very good at hiding things.

339
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
But he can't hide things.

340
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
My brother Lu Jin.

341
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,520
He is a great martial artist.

342
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
It's a pity that he died in your hands.

343
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
My sister Lu Yan is loyal.

344
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
She is a little obedient.

345
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
I am indeed different from them.

346
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
The reason why I can get the public's attention

347
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
is because I have patience.

348
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Aren't we people

349
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
just patient?

350
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Zang Hai.

351
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
I still have a grudge against you.

352
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
At first,

353
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I thought you were looking for a return for Ping Jin.

354
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
But Ping Jin is dead.

355
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
But I didn't think about your steps.

356
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
At that time, I knew

357
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
you are not doing this for others.

358
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,520
You are doing this for yourself.

359
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
I am curious.

360
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Who are you?

361
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Lu Fei.

362
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
Lu Fei.

363
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I am here.

364
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
I am here.

365
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
It's good.

366
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Uncle.

367
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
I got it.

368
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Gui Xi.

369
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
This is Gui Xi.

370
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I have never seen him.

371
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,520
But this thing is in my hand.

372
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,520
I knew it was Gui Xi.

373
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
I can't do it.

374
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
I can't do it.

375
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Lu Fei.

376
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,520
I didn't take you back from the Qingtian Sword.

377
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
You are right.

378
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,520
You did a great job.

379
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Thank you for your compliment.

380
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Zang Hai.

381
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
You are really smart.

382
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
But you are so short of breath.

383
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Eunuch Xiao.

384
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
You are really lucky.

385
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
You want to kill my life.

386
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
It's not that easy.

387
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Tell me.

388
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Who are you?

389
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
Do you remember?

390
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Kuaiduo?

391
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Kuaiduo is my father.

392
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
I know.

393
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Why do you keep being so stubborn?

394
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
You are Kuaiduo's son.

395
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Your appearance...

396
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,520
is not the same as Kuaiduo's.

397
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
But your appearance...

398
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,520
is not the same as Kuaiduo's.

399
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
You are the same as Kuaiduo's son.

400
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
You are the same as Kuaiduo's son.

401
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Your appearance...

402
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
I can always see...

403
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
the familiar things...

404
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
from your eyes.

405
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Life and death.

406
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Fang Luying.

407
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
You are so stupid.

408
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,520
You treat your enemy's son as your father.

409
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
No wonder you are so good at...

410
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
killing people.

411
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Isn't Zhong Luying...

412
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
killed by Eunuch?

413
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
He is not a traitor.

414
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
He deserves to die.

415
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
I'm afraid Eunuch's death...

416
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
won't be easy.

417
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Your Majesty.

418
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
You are so bitter.

419
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,520
It turns out that Kuaiduo found him...

420
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
and handed him to you.

421
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
You hid him in the palace.

422
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Since...

423
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
you don't need him,

424
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
why don't you...

425
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,520
take care of him as a slave?

426
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Donghan.

427
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
You are so generous.

428
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,520
You are so kind to His Majesty.

429
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,520
Since you are Kuaiduo's son,

430
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,520
and you are doing the opposite,

431
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,520
why do you do this?

432
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,520
I know that you want to make a fake ghost...

433
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,520
and put it back to make it a real one.

434
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,520
And use the truth to deal with your enemy.

435
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Right?

436
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
Right?

437
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Father, be careful.

438
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
It's okay.

439
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
Who would have thought that...

440
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
when I came to Qingtian,

441
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,520
I would get this gift.

442
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
This ghost-wrapped vest...

443
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,520
is still in my hands.

444
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
And you, Zanghai,

445
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,520
just bear this for me.

446
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Canglong.

447
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,520
His Majesty spent ten years...

448
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
not opening this vest.

449
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Do you think you can do it?

450
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,520
You want to use the method of opening this vest...

451
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
to make it a real one?

452
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,520
You don't need to worry about this vest.

453
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
I will do it well.

454
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
Today is the festival.

455
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Let's send Zanghai...

456
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,520
to the Qingtian group.

457
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Yes.

458
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Let's go.

459
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
I will do my best to make it a real one.

460
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
I will do my best to make it a real one.

461
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,520
I will do my best to make it a real one.

462
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Don't worry.

463
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Your Highness.

464
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Your Highness.

465
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Why are you here?

466
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
Eunuch Cao.

467
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
It's been a long time.

468
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
How are you?

469
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
Don't worry, Your Highness.

470
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
I can't die.

471
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Zanghai's death is too dangerous.

472
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
Do you think so?

473
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Don't worry.

474
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
You are so smart.

475
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
You can take the vest alone.

476
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Do you really think...

477
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
he can give you the vest?

478
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
I think...

479
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,520
he will make a fake one for you.

480
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,520
Eunuch Cao.

481
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Don't talk nonsense.

482
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,520
Leave the vest.

483
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Your Highness.

484
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,520
We have a contract.

485
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
We can...

486
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
sit down and talk.

487
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Okay.

488
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
I will talk to you now.

489
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
You...

490
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
You are a scoundrel.

491
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
How dare you attack us?

492
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Kill them!

493
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Kill them!

494
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
Go!

495
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
Go!

496
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Go!

497
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
Go!

498
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Go!

499
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
You can't wait.

500
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Leave the vest.

501
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Zang.

502
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Give the vest to Lanzi.

503
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Give the vest to him.

504
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
I forgot the armor.

505
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,520
You are so fast.

506
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
I won't let you go.

507
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Give me the vest.

508
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
I will keep you a whole family.

509
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
How dare you...

510
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
know me?

511
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
You are so fast.

512
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
Go!

513
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Master, Rong Jin.

514
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
I have a favor to ask you.

515
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Tonight...

516
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,520
I don't want His Majesty to know.

517
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,520
I want His Majesty to remember...

518
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,520
I am loyal to him.

519
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Okay.

520
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
Guixin.

521
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Where are you?

522
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
I am here.

523
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Mother.

524
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
Mother.

525
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Mother.

526
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Father.

527
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Father.

528
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Father.

529
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
Mother.

530
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Father.

531
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
Mother.

532
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Hold on.

533
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
I will take you home.

534
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Come here.

535
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Zang.

536
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
Mother.

537
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
Take good care of me.

538
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
And...

539
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
take Guixin.

540
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Your father...

541
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
died.

542
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,520
He didn't leave anything to me.

543
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Right?

544
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,520
It's okay.

545
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,520
I will ask him.

546
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Mother.

547
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Mother.

548
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,520
Mother.

549
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Mother.

550
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
I will die.

551
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
I will live.

552
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
I will die.

553
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
I will live.

554
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
But I will never...

555
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
Mother.

556
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Mother.

557
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Mother.

558
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
Mother.

559
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Mother.

560
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Mother.

561
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,520
Mother.

562
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
An Tu.

563
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
I need you to take your mother back to the palace.

564
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
An Tu.

565
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
My mother is gone.

566
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Guixin was taken away.

567
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,520
I know you are sad.

568
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
But I need you to listen to me.

569
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
It's almost dawn.

570
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
We don't have time.

571
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
You need to take your mother back to the palace.

572
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,520
And make her death a surprise.

573
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
What will we do?

574
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
Don't worry.

575
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
I will take care of everything.

576
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
Guixin.

577
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
No matter what happens in the future,

578
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
we will face it together.

579
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
Remember.

580
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
No one has come here tonight.

581
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
I will take care of my mother.

582
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Mother.

583
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
Mother.

584
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Long live the emperor.

585
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Come.

586
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Rise.

587
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

588
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
Princess Dongxia.

589
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
Last night,

590
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,520
the emperor got into an accident.

591
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Tell me.

592
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
What happened last night?

593
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,520
What happened last night?

594
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,560
if you wanted her to live for this whole day

595
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,800
I wouldn't have won a title

596
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,280
if I couldn't get her married

597
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,960
asking her Brother Lan and so on

598
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,520
When I figured out

599
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:37,800
that she didn't want you and Fatty

600
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,680
she clearly talked about it

601
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,580
one thing

602
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,140
She made 나와

603
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
out that

604
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
I will give them to you.

605
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,520
I will never give them to you.

606
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,520
So who is going to tell me

607
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,320
where the fireworks came from?

608
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,920
Who put them?

609
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
What's wrong?

610
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,120
Did they kill them?

611
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,320
The death of the queen of Dongxia.

612
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
What a coincidence.

613
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Your Majesty.

614
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,520
The queen of Dongxia is in the capital of Da Yong.

615
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
It's very sudden.

616
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,520
I think it's not a good idea to do this.

617
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
It's important to take care of Dongxia.

618
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
We have to have an explanation

619
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
for Dongxia.

620
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
You have a plan now.

621
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,120
I will send a decree to

622
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,520
the queen of Dongxia to get sick and have a stroke.

623
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
I will be in pain.

624
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,520
I will send her to the capital of Da Yong

625
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
to send her to the capital of Da Yong.

626
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
I will return to Dongxia.

627
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
I will go to Dongxia to see her.

628
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

629
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
Xie Huguang.

630
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
The military department has issued a decree

631
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,520
to the capital of Dongxia to get sick and have a stroke.

632
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
The total of five thousand soldiers

633
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,520
will be sent to the capital of Da Yong.

634
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
The death of the queen of Dongxia

635
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
will lead to the death of the border.

636
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

637
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,520
The capital of Da Yong

638
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,520
will be sent to the capital of Da Yong.

639
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
The capital of Da Yong

640
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
will be sent to the capital of Da Yong.

641
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,520
The capital of Da Yong

642
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,520
will be sent to the capital of Da Yong.

643
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
The capital of Da Yong

644
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
will be sent to the capital of Da Yong.

645
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,520
The capital of Da Yong

646
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
will be sent to the capital of Da Yong.

647
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,520
Defence

648
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,520
The rest is me

649
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
The rain is me

650
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,520
The sadness is like the falling rain

651
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
The song is with the emperor

652
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,520
I am in the dream

653
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,520
The autumn is me

654
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
The world is me

655
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,520
The life is me

656
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,520
You are me too
