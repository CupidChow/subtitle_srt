00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,300
Episode 29

2
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,640
My lord.

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm here to visit Lord Zang.

4
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,440
Where is he?

5
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,560
Lord Zang is in the grave.

6
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,600
Okay.

7
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,600
I will surely find someone similar to you.

8
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,240
Let's drink...

9
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,800
Why didn't you come to Eunuch Cao's family dinner that day?

10
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,320
Were you too busy or did you not want to come?

11
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,120
What are you talking about?

12
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't want to come to Eunuch Cao's family dinner.

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,080
I was just busy with other things.

14
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,600
I forgot about it.

15
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,560
It's fine. You still have a chance.

16
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,400
Eunuch Cao's family dinner is scheduled for five days.

17
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,760
You can come again.

18
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,080
No need to trouble yourself, Lord Lu.

19
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,680
I just want to do my best to complete the funeral.

20
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,160
Are you really that busy?

21
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,560
Yes.

22
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,680
I came to give you this letter.

23
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,080
It can guarantee your prosperity and prosperity.

24
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,320
But since Lord Zang is not willing to accept it,

25
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,320
this letter is not meant for you.

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,640
Every year, the officials have to come to the front of the late emperor's tomb to worship.

27
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,240
If you work hard and have high merits,

28
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,320
you can't be able to build his tomb at the time of the late emperor's memorial.

29
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,840
So,

30
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,440
this funeral must be completed before the last day of the Chongyang Festival.

31
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,240
Lord Zang, don't be so careless.

32
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,040
Are you talking about me or threatening me?

33
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
How dare I?

34
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,200
You are a high-ranking official.

35
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,120
You are a witness of the Qingtian Sword.

36
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,640
I just said it without any other meaning.

37
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,040
But the last month of the Chongyang Festival is not long enough.

38
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,560
What do you want to eat these days?

39
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,840
Lord, don't pretend to be so happy.

40
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
We don't have enough people. We still have to shorten the period.

41
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,440
Who doesn't know that Duke Cao is deliberately torturing us?

42
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,840
Why are you pretending to be a good person?

43
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,040
This is...

44
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,840
Don't blame him, Lord. He is the King of the Five Elements of the Qingtian Sword.

45
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,240
Shi Juan, don't talk nonsense here.

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,640
The King of the Five Elements of the Qingtian Sword is dead?

47
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:06,040
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

48
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,640
What a shame!

49
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,840
I didn't know that this craftsman is still a high-ranking official.

50
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Lord Shi, although you are not a high-ranking official,

51
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,440
you have a position in the Qingtian Sword.

52
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,240
I want to ask you

53
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,240
what kind of crime is it to slander the eunuch in the Sword of the Minister of War?

54
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,840
Lord Shi, don't ask. Shi Juan didn't mean that.

55
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,440
What Lord Shi said just now, I heard it clearly.

56
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,840
How about I take him back to the Commandant's Office

57
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,240
and tell him in person to Duke Cao?

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,840
Who are you trying to scare?

59
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
If you have the guts, take me to His Majesty and tell him.

60
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,640
Stop!

61
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
He is a court official. He is not an ordinary craftsman.

62
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,840
If you dare to make trouble in front of the late emperor,

63
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
and His Majesty finds out,

64
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,440
you will be punished for slandering the capital.

65
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,840
I'm afraid no one can save you then.

66
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,440
Shi Juan, apologize to Lord Lu now.

67
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,440
I will not obey your orders. I will apologize to you.

68
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,440
Please forgive me, Lord Lu.

69
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,240
I will consider Duke Cao's case seriously.

70
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,840
All right.

71
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,640
For the sake of Lord Zang, I will spare your life today.

72
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,640
Lord Zang,

73
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,440
I have one more thing to ask you.

74
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,840
I have a brother named Lu Jin.

75
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,840
Do you know how he died?

76
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,640
How?

77
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,440
Take care, Lord Zang.

78
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,640
Come, get up.

79
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,640
Are you all right?

80
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,040
I'm fine.

81
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,240
Lord, how can we play the bow in front of Chongyang Festival?

82
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,440
Even if we don't sleep every day, we can't do it.

83
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,240
I'm fine.

84
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Marquis Pingjing is strong and fierce.

85
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I'm his trusted aide now,

86
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,640
but it's not easy to kill him.

87
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,440
I can also make Marquis Pingjing be a good son.

88
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,840
He's already a high-ranking official, and he's eager to make His Majesty afraid.

89
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,640
Cao Jingxian is vicious and vicious.

90
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,240
He's always been hostile to me.

91
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,440
Now, he and Marquis Pingjing have been suspecting each other for life.

92
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,040
If we have a chance, we can lure him into the trap and save him.

93
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
But we can't be too sure.

94
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,840
We can't be sure that there won't be any changes.

95
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,440
We must be fully confident.

96
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,440
What's more,

97
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,040
the third person is also watching the whole game in the dark.

98
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,040
No matter what, we must make Marquis Pingjing and Cao Jingxian fight first.

99
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Only when the two clans are injured and the situation is chaotic,

100
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,640
can the third person show up.

101
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,840
When the time comes, I will be the one who will strike back.

102
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,440
I will be the one who will strike back.

103
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,440
The Third Person

104
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Young Master, why are you here in person?

105
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,240
Please sit.

106
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,240
You're being too polite, Fang Hai.

107
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,240
You're my father's personal witness.

108
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,640
He chose your house.

109
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,840
What? I can't come?

110
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
What are you saying?

111
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,440
If you have something to tell me,

112
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,840
I will go to you.

113
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,440
You asked me to do something a few days ago, but I couldn't help you.

114
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm really sorry.

115
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
I didn't sleep well for a few nights.

116
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,640
You didn't sleep well last night.

117
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,440
You're just thinking about me.

118
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,040
Sit.

119
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
I came tonight

120
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,040
because I heard that Eunuch Cao

121
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,440
asked you to complete the work before the Chongyang Festival.

122
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,640
This is really hard.

123
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
I can talk to you in front of you.

124
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm afraid that you might lose your hat.

125
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm really sorry.

126
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
You don't have to.

127
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
You came from the Marquis Manor.

128
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,840
We're the best family.

129
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,640
You're in trouble.

130
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,440
I can't just let you die.

131
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,640
You said that I came from the Marquis Manor.

132
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,640
I can't drag you to explain it to me.

133
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,840
Besides, this is a matter of personal interest.

134
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,640
I should have said yes.

135
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,400
Besides, the

136
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,840
Grand General's grave is now in charge of the lower official.

137
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,040
It's not something that can be solved by saying yes.

138
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,840
All right.

139
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,440
I'll tell you the truth.

140
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Give me the account book

141
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,840
and I'll solve it for you.

142
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,040
Account book?

143
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Yes.

144
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,240
The Chongyang Festival is coming soon.

145
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,040
You have to shorten the work period.

146
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Now, you have to have several more workers

147
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,440
to solve it.

148
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,040
Zhang Hai.

149
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,040
Since I'm here today,

150
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,840
I'm here to help you think of a good way.

151
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,640
As long as you give me the account book,

152
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,240
I promise that you can hand it over on time.

153
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,440
Hand it over on time?

154
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,240
Young Master, do you have any ability to communicate with heaven?

155
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
You don't have to agree to it right away.

156
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,640
Think about it.

157
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,440
I have nothing else to do tonight.

158
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,840
Your yard is quite nice.

159
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,040
I'll go around and wait for you.

160
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,840
Young Master.

161
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,040
Do as you said.

162
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
All right. Don't see me off.

163
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,240
Then we have a deal.

164
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,440
Tomorrow, I'll go to Qingtian Sword

165
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
and ask you to get the account book.

166
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,440
I'll wait for you anytime, Young Master.

167
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,840
Hai.

168
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,040
You really plan to give him the account book?

169
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,640
No matter what he thinks,

170
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,040
the tombstone will be repaired.

171
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,040
There's someone backing him up.

172
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,840
But have you thought about how to fight against Pingjing Duke?

173
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,640
I wanted to drag him down a few steps.

174
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,440
Once Pingjing Duke asks about it,

175
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,440
at least Zhuang's Mansion will be entangled.

176
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,640
But I think it's still not good enough.

177
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,440
Old Man, what's your trick?

178
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,640
You...

179
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,240
Stop right there.

180
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,640
Get up.

181
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Are your legs okay?

182
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
You brat.

183
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,040
You're so good at lying.

184
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,040
You're so good at selling coffins.

185
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,440
You're so good at it.

186
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
Xiao Hai.

187
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,640
Xiao Hai, those craftsmen from the workshop are back.

188
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,240
They're not the only ones, right?

189
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,840
How do you know?

190
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,240
There's an old batch of craftsmen.

191
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,640
There are over 20 of them.

192
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,440
Is there more?

193
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,040
Yes.

194
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,240
They're pushing the car.

195
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,640
The car is full of carving bricks,

196
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,040
and two cars of wood and materials.

197
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,840
I'll go get them.

198
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,040
I'll go get them.

199
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,640
I'll go get them.

200
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,240
I'll go get them.

201
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I'll go get them.

202
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
I'll go get them.

203
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,840
Xiao Hai.

204
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,640
Really?

205
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,840
Absolutely.

206
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,040
Zhuang Zhi Fu has been coming to Zang Hai's house.

207
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,240
He helped him.

208
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,640
The Ministry of Works opened a door for Zang Hai.

209
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,840
He's so good at it.

210
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,240
Zang Hai can do it.

211
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,040
No wonder Zang Hai was so afraid.

212
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
He didn't want to come into my house.

213
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,440
He had planned to get away.

214
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,240
Zhuang Zhi Fu, this idiot.

215
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,440
How dare he do it to you?

216
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,640
You said he's a fool.

217
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,040
Maybe he

218
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,440
can't even see

219
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,440
that I'm making things difficult for Zang Hai.

220
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Godfather, Zang Hai is ungrateful.

221
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
He failed to do it twice.

222
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,040
What should we do

223
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,240
with the clues?

224
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,440
How much do you think Zhuang Lu Yin knows about this?

225
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,640
Zhuang Lu Yin?

226
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,440
Don't act rashly.

227
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,040
Let me try it in the market.

228
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Godfather, you mean...

229
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,640
Zhuang Zhi Fu is a disciple of a lawyer.

230
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,840
If he joins us, he'll definitely be able to save money.

231
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,640
Zhuang Lu Yin hates the person who's behind all this.

232
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,240
In order to protect himself, Zang Hai

233
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,440
dragged Zhuang Zhi Fu into the water.

234
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
If he finds out,

235
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,840
Zang Hai will die.

236
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Find a way to let Zhuang Lu Yin know

237
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,240
what he's done.

238
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,840
Father, you want to see me?

239
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,640
Kneel.

240
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,040
Kneel!

241
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,240
Father.

242
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,240
Zhuang Zhi Fu, you're capable now.

243
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
You even gave Fu Zhi Song money to build the grave.

244
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
How dare you?

245
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,840
Father, I didn't.

246
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,440
You dare lie to me?

247
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Father, I...

248
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,440
I just changed some materials.

249
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,640
But I didn't touch anything on the surface.

250
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,840
As long as Zang Hai can finish the funeral,

251
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,040
no one will find out.

252
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,240
What is this?

253
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,440
Look for yourself!

254
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Father...

255
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
You can just make some money.

256
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
But you're so stupid that people will find out.

257
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,040
You can't even make money!

258
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,040
My Lord, I know I was wrong.

259
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,440
Please forgive him.

260
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,040
You still have the nerve to plead for him?

261
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,240
You're so stupid that you don't know what's going on.

262
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm telling you.

263
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
If Zang Hai can't finish the funeral,

264
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,440
the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Rites will investigate it thoroughly.

265
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
You think you can just fill the materials once

266
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,240
and then make some money on the account?

267
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,640
No one will find out?

268
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,640
Then I'm asking you, how do I know?

269
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
Father...

270
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,440
Father, I know I was wrong.

271
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
I won't do it again. What should I do now?

272
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,440
You have to think of a way to save me.

273
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
It's all because of Zang Hai, Father.

274
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,440
He had to drag me to do it.

275
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,040
How about we push him out?

276
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,840
Push him out and hand him over to the police?

277
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,240
You have the money.

278
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,840
Push him out? What's the use?

279
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,440
My Lord, calm down.

280
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,040
Don't be mad at yourself.

281
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,240
But about Fu'er, you still have to help him.

282
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,640
If you don't want to be in someone else's hands,

283
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,840
wipe all your mistakes away.

284
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,240
Not only do you have to replace all the materials you took,

285
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,040
you also have to steal all your money.

286
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,840
Go to the stock market and make up for what you didn't do.

287
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,640
I know.

288
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,040
You're using these rotten stones to make powder?

289
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,040
My Lord, how do you know?

290
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
You're asking me how I know?

291
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,640
How did you learn to steal and cut the material?

292
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,440
My Lord, please forgive me.

293
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,040
It was indeed me. I was too obsessed with money and money.

294
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,440
I did something I shouldn't have.

295
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,040
How did this matter get into your ears?

296
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,440
Zang Hai, you weren't obsessed with money before.

297
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,640
That's because...

298
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,040
because I used to work in the Marquis Manor.

299
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,640
I couldn't cause trouble for you.

300
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,640
I know my mistake.

301
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,040
Please punish me.

302
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,640
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,840
Please punish me, My Lord.

304
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
Get up.

305
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,640
I think you're lying to me.

306
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,640
You're a smart person.

307
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,440
You probably don't know what's going on inside.

308
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,240
Tell me.

309
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Did someone force you to do this?

310
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,040
I don't understand what you mean.

311
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,840
I only have you behind me.

312
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,640
This matter is indeed my own fault.

313
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,840
Let me ask you again.

314
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,240
Did someone force you to do this?

315
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Tell me the truth.

316
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,640
I won't hold you accountable.

317
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,840
If you don't tell me, I'll investigate it later.

318
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,440
I won't hold you accountable then.

319
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
This matter...

320
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,440
is really my own fault.

321
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,840
If anything happens to me, it's my own fault.

322
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,640
I won't get involved in the Marquis Manor.

323
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,440
How could this small matter get involved in the Marquis Manor?

324
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,640
I'll let you go.

325
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,240
Be smarter next time.

326
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
I'll be more careful next time.

327
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,040
Father.

328
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,840
Why are you back?

329
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,640
I came to pay my respects to you.

330
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,240
I've made a leopard.

331
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,040
I've given the leopard skin to the butler.

332
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,440
It's getting colder.

333
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,840
Father fought in the cold and it's hard to keep warm.

334
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,440
I thought you'd keep warm when you're in the nest.

335
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,240
I've thought about it. But I'm not in the mood today.

336
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,040
Go back first.

337
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,840
Yes.

338
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,440
You've been the small chief?

339
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,040
Yes.

340
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,240
I made a contribution a few days ago.

341
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,440
That's why I'm the small chief.

342
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,040
I won't ask you. You won't tell me.

343
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,440
It's just that the small chief...

344
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,640
is as famous as my father.

345
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,040
You're wearing this armor. It's quite pretty.

346
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,840
This life is fated to be painted on the gold AMG chest.

347
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
But that doesn't make me happy.

348
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,040
Whatever you did after and until we die

349
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,640
don't coming to save your father's life.

350
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,240
Er's home!

351
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,240
They should be changing his name to Bridegroomage department.

352
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,080
That person

353
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,000
Ministry of Works and Rites

354
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,520
should have checked it

355
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,960
The materials, materials and materials

356
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,480
were all sent here

357
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,880
But they were all tampered with

358
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,000
Ministry of Revenue has spent so much money

359
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,480
Not only did they make a good profit

360
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,080
but also reported the number of people

361
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,800
The key is that they can balance the account so beautifully

362
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,520
If the Manor of Zhuangzhi

363
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,240
puts its mind on the right track

364
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,320
they will be sent to the Inner Council soon

365
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,120
A person like him

366
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,080
can live in the official city

367
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,880
peacefully until today

368
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,160
He is really well protected

369
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,000
The person who protects him

370
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,440
has to protect you now

371
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,640
I, He Zixing, have something to report

372
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,760
What is the matter, Ministry of Revenue?

373
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,360
Chongyang is coming

374
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,040
The Ministry of Rites is preparing for the ceremony of the late emperor

375
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,640
I heard that the tomb of General Fu

376
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,800
will be sealed and completed after Chongyang

377
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,000
But the ceremony of the 10th day of the ceremony

378
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,640
will be held without any doubt

379
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm afraid it will be too hasty

380
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,040
I suggest

381
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,480
that General Fu be buried 10 days before Chongyang

382
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,680
It can keep the late emperor's ceremony peaceful

383
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,160
and let General Fu enjoy the fire

384
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,160
You are well-considered

385
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,880
His Majesty will be satisfied

386
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,520
But I heard that the tomb of General Fu

387
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,880
was repaired very slowly 10 days before

388
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,400
It's not easy to be buried 10 days before

389
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,360
If you want to be buried 10 days earlier

390
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,080
I'm afraid the Qingtian Sword will be difficult

391
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,840
Eunuch Cao

392
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,400
The construction of the sword

393
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,080
is due to insufficient craftsmen

394
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,320
and the heavy weight of the sword

395
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,920
If it is repaired 10 days earlier

396
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,200
I'm afraid it will be difficult for me to handle it

397
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,280
If you really find it difficult

398
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,920
Minister Li

399
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,480
think about it

400
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,640
Is there any other way to deal with it?

401
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,040
I can't think of any other solution

402
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm afraid I'll lose my life

403
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,400
Minister Zhang

404
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,560
This time in Chongyang

405
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,680
His Majesty will personally go to the imperial tomb

406
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,520
to worship the late emperor and the late empress dowager

407
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
It's a big matter

408
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,080
Don't be careless

409
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,520
You have the talent of a gold tail

410
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,760
The skill of making fish

411
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,760
is not easy

412
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,960
Since there are insufficient craftsmen

413
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,040
and they can all finish the work in Chongyang

414
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,800
I'll send more craftsmen to you

415
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,320
I'm sure you can finish the work 10 days earlier

416
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,120
It's a good thing

417
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,960
Are you going to be happy with the gift shop?

418
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,640
Okay

419
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,360
In that case

420
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,160
I'll go and report to His Majesty

421
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,480
Wait

422
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,920
This ceremony and funeral

423
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,920
have always been held by the Qingtian Sword and the Ministry of Rites

424
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,920
Now why does Lord He decide it himself?

425
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,920
But since Lord He said

426
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
The late general's tomb

427
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,480
will be closed for 10 days

428
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,760
In my opinion

429
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,960
It's better to wait

430
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,200
After the late emperor's ceremony is over for 10 days

431
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,480
and then the late general's funeral

432
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,560
to ensure the late emperor's safety

433
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,360
and not rush to the palace

434
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,560
and be rude to the late general

435
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,880
Lord He

436
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,360
Do you agree?

437
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,360
Yes

438
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,680
It's a misunderstanding

439
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,480
In the battle of Xichang

440
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,240
the late emperor was carried out of the blood of the mountains

441
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,240
and saved the country

442
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,880
He was dragged into his funeral

443
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,960
which made the general feel uneasy

444
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,840
If he was to rush to the funeral for the incense

445
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,800
it would make the late general feel uneasy

446
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,880
and make the soldiers feel sad

447
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,600
The late general loved the country

448
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,680
and he was buried after the late emperor's ceremony

449
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,560
which was also his duty

450
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,960
Lord He is right

451
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
We can't delay the late general's funeral

452
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,480
It's not right to be rude to the late general

453
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
We should wait until the funeral is over

454
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,480
I agree

455
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,360
I agree

456
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,760
I agree

457
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,160
I agree

458
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,880
I agree

459
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,320
Since Lord He is so thoughtful

460
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,960
I will report to His Majesty

461
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,920
and do as Lord He says

462
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,080
He knew it was Zang Hai

463
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
who dragged his son into the water

464
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,760
but he didn't kill him

465
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
He stood up to help His Majesty

466
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,520
and said

467
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,920
He stood up to help His Majesty

468
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,520
He was so kind to us

469
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,240
He was so kind to us

470
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:05,920
Father

471
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,880
You have found the truth

472
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Zhuang Luyan

473
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,800
I'm afraid he used his own money

474
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,080
to make up for his loss

475
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,120
He did it for Zang Hai

476
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,920
What is so important to him?

477
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,280
Of course it's Guixi

478
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,000
Zang Hai must be helping him to find Guixi

479
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,320
And I think

480
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,680
he might have a good chance

481
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,040
That's why he was protecting him so much

482
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
Zhuang Luyan

483
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,440
has been a minister for many years

484
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,960
and he has done so many things

485
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,200
What have you done?

486
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,360
You really scared us

487
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,160
That's the whole story

488
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,400
This Marquis Pingjing

489
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,360
is really a hidden man

490
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,960
He not only solved the difficulties for Zang Hai

491
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,240
but also fought for ten days

492
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,600
In this way

493
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,880
General Fu's tomb

494
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,400
can be completed smoothly

495
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
But Marquis Pingjing and Cao Jinxian

496
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,800
have been safe and sound

497
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,640
How could they fight so hard

498
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,360
for Zang Hai in the court?

499
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,560
It's because Lord Zang is capable

500
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,320
and he is respected by Marquis Pingjing

501
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,640
I don't think it's that simple

502
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,640
I'm afraid it has something to do with his secret

503
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,240
If he didn't say

504
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,160
maybe he has his own difficulties

505
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,360
I don't think so

506
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,760
OK, OK, OK

507
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,680
You have your own difficulties

508
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,960
I'm trying to help you

509
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,600
You are just a little bit better

510
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,120
Miss

511
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,640
Come on, drink it again

512
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,120
Can you...

513
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,000
I know

514
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
I will keep an eye on Lord Zang for you

515
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,440
You are the best

516
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm here to see Eunuch Cao

517
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,440
What can I do for you?

518
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,120
Lord

519
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,800
You are the eldest princess of the Marquis's Mansion

520
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,600
and the deputy minister of the Ministry of Works

521
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,440
You have a bright future

522
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
I've always been optimistic about you

523
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,480
But recently

524
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,760
you have disappointed me

525
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,080
Eunuch

526
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,680
I don't understand

527
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,640
Yuren

528
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,080
Show Lord Zang

529
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,440
what you have done

530
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,120
For the past ten years

531
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,280
the county of Li Shui County

532
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,920
has been in the way of the government's cultivation

533
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,080
This year

534
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
the county of Li Shui County

535
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,320
has been flooded with three salt lakes

536
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,360
At that time, your grandfather was still in office

537
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,160
and found someone to make up for you

538
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,360
For the past 13 years

539
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
you have been in office of the governor of Jianan

540
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,400
You have been trying to get the money

541
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,160
Your father

542
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,760
forced the local officials

543
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,960
to take all the blame for you

544
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,480
In order to make you more stable

545
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,520
your grandfather

546
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,400
put you in the lowest salary of the oil and water

547
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,400
But you still have the same bad intentions

548
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Five years ago, the oil and water were changed

549
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,960
Did you take all the money

550
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,000
that the imperial mausoleum was repaired?

551
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,560
At that time

552
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,160
the imperial mausoleum was flooded

553
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,520
and the late emperor was restless

554
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,320
You

555
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,640
Eunuch

556
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,280
this money

557
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,040
you have a share in it

558
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,920
How dare you!

559
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,640
These are all the pieces

560
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,760
that the local officials

561
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,480
brought to you to report your crimes

562
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,400
You have been sealed in my place

563
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,440
I have been helping you to settle down

564
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,520
The funeral of General Fu

565
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,640
is just a piece of cake

566
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,240
The emperor can't see it

567
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,720
but I can't see it?

568
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,800
If the emperor finds out one day

569
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,800
tell me

570
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,680
how can I

571
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,400
take revenge for you and the emperor?

572
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,400
Don't be angry

573
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,560
Don't be angry

574
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh, my God

575
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,720
I'm not sensible

576
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,120
Please forgive me

577
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,520
for the sake of my father

578
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,080
I will

579
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,680
take revenge for you

580
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
That's good

581
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,320
How are you going to

582
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,280
take revenge for me?

583
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,880
A few days ago

584
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,760
the imperial mausoleum was repaired

585
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,520
and you worked hard

586
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,840
You care about the emperor

587
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,400
and I care about you

588
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,840
How about

589
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,160
I go back and check the accounts

590
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,960
and get some money

591
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,200
to pay you back?

592
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,280
What's the matter?

593
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,040
Are you still thinking about it?

594
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,440
This time

595
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,480
even your father can't protect you

596
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,600
All right, get up

597
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,080
I'll give you a piece of my mind

598
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,600
and I won't be angry with you

599
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,960
You can help me with something

600
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,040
but

601
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,520
you have to do it

602
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,680
I heard that

603
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,760
Zang Hai is helping your father

604
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,880
to find something

605
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,320
I want you to ask him

606
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,000
if he has found it

607
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,560
Eunuch Wang

608
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,600
if you want to know about my father

609
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,960
you can ask him yourself

610
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,000
If I ask him behind his back

611
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,920
if he knows about me

612
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,280
I

613
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,920
We're not discussing with you

614
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,840
You have to check it for us

615
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,320
If you can't find it

616
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,160
Lu Yan

617
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,720
This is

618
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,680
how many hours of ice?

619
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,480
Zhang Jing

620
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,120
Did you confess?

621
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,600
Yes

622
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,440
I checked the case of corruption

623
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,160
but I didn't expect

624
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,400
I found it on you

625
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,840
If it's less

626
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,760
I would cover it for you

627
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,200
But I didn't expect

628
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,000
you'd be greedy for 80,000 taels of silver

629
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,800
I've been waiting for you

630
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,240
I thought you could

631
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,680
tell us

632
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,880
about it

633
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,440
But you didn't

634
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,200
Eunuch Wang

635
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,560
We have no choice

636
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
We can only report to His Majesty

637
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,120
We can do whatever we want

638
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,080
Please spare me

639
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,120
I didn't know the rules

640
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,800
Eunuch Wang

641
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Please spare me

642
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,320
I'll be a good man in the future

643
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,120
Please spare me

644
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,280
It's over

645
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,080
Eunuch Wang

646
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,560
Please spare me

647
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,840
Eunuch Wang

648
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,300
It's over

649
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,040
Please spare me

650
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,000
Please spare me

651
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,860
relevant

652
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,200
Wang

653
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,840
Mrbin

654
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,700
We've got a deal

655
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,440
You must help me with this.

656
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,520
Find out the truth.

657
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,740
Mother Signior Er talk.

658
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,440
Move.

659
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
I want to talk with Miss Jiang.

660
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,600
This man is my daughter.

661
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,940
Can we have lunch?

662
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,200
I want to eat something.

663
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,500
No, I can't eat.

664
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,480
Take it out.

665
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,460
So take it.

666
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,560
No way.

667
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,480
No.

668
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,320
Let's wait for the signal to stop.

669
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,180
Let's blame him and slow him down.

670
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,900
The whiteSpotடoo

671
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,700
isresisting the evchara energy of Commissar Lu Xiang!

672
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,440
Commissar Lu Xiang is

673
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
I'm sorry

674
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
I have something to tell you

675
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Please have a seat

676
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Lord Zang

677
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Lord Zhuang

678
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Why are you here?

679
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Don't be so modest

680
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Just call me Lord

681
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
Young Master

682
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
You have something to tell me?

683
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Come on

684
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
This way, please

685
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Please have a seat

686
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Come on

687
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Zang Hai

688
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,440
I was so kind to you

689
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Don't mind it

690
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
We are family

691
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Young Master

692
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
You have been nice to me

693
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
You never treated me badly

694
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
I'm just helping you

695
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
We are family

696
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Yes, yes, yes

697
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Family, family

698
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Fine

699
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,440
From now on

700
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
I'm your brother

701
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
You are my brother

702
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Zang Hai

703
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,440
What do you think of the jade?

704
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,440
It's pure and gentle

705
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
It's the best jade

706
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
Do you like it?

707
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
Young Master

708
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
You are in charge of

709
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
General Fu's funeral

710
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
You have been working day and night

711
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
You have solved

712
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,440
such a complicated problem

713
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
and you are worried about me

714
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
I will give you

715
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,440
the jade

716
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Young Master

717
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
I can't accept it

718
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Please accept it

719
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Young Master

720
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
I really can't accept it

721
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Zang Hai

722
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
I'm sorry

723
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm sorry

724
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Zang Hai

725
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
You are a gentleman

726
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
I'll give it to you

727
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Just take it

728
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Young Master

729
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
Fine

730
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,440
Thank you for your kindness

731
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Fine

732
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Sit down

733
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,440
Sit down

734
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
I used to be

735
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
a talented man

736
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
in the Marquis's Mansion

737
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
But I was busy

738
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
and didn't have time

739
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
to talk to you

740
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
My father told me

741
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
to be more friendly

742
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
and learn more

743
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
about the way to deal with people

744
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
I was busy

745
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
and didn't have time

746
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
to come here

747
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
recently

748
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,440
I'll visit you more

749
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
to ask for advice

750
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
Fine

751
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
As long as I can help

752
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
Young Master

753
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
I will do my best

754
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
I will do my best

755
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
Fine

756
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
It's a deal

757
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
I'll come tomorrow

758
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Good tea

759
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
I'm sorry

760
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
You are so ungraceful

761
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
for not visiting the Three Gossips

762
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Now that the last meeting is over

763
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
the House of Zhuang

764
00:41:49,440 --> 00:42:02,440
suddenly started to act

765
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
You are so ungraceful

766
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
for not visiting the Three Gossips

767
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
Now that the last meeting is over

768
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,440
is Cao Jingxian

769
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,200
What did Cao Jingxian give Zhuang's Mansion?

770
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,680
He dared to betray his father?

771
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,400
I'm afraid Zhuang's Mansion

772
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,120
gave Cao Jingxian too many benefits

773
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,600
What are you drawing, my disciple?

774
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,240
Guixi

775
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,880
Have you seen Guixi?

776
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,400
Of course not

777
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,360
But I haven't seen Cao Jingxian and Zhuang's Mansion

778
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,880
Since Lu Jing died

779
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,040
I planted a suspicious seed

780
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,080
in Cao Jingxian's heart

781
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,560
Now

782
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,440
this seed should sprout

783
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,080
I'm so happy

784
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,520
to see you

785
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm so happy

786
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,320
to see you

787
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,680
I'm so happy

788
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,880
to see you

789
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,240
I'm so happy

790
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,480
to see you

791
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,840
I'm so happy

792
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,960
to see you

793
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,240
I'm so happy

794
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,440
to see you

795
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,840
I'm so happy

796
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,040
to see you

797
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,240
I'm so happy

798
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,440
to see you

799
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,840
I'm so happy

800
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,040
to see you

801
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,440
I'm so happy

802
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,640
to see you

803
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm so happy

804
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,240
to see you

805
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,840
I'm the one who is blessed

806
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,280
I'm the one who is willful

807
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:45,600
I'll always be remembered

808
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,200
I'm the one who is alive

809
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,640
I'm the one who is dead

810
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,960
I'm the one who is with the rain

811
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,640
When the sun rises like a sun

812
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,120
I sing with the military song

813
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,320
I'm the one in the dream

814
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,720
I'm the one in the dream

815
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,680
I'm the one in the palm

816
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,360
I'm the one in the palm

817
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,640
The world is me

818
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,480
The world is me

819
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,080
You are me too
