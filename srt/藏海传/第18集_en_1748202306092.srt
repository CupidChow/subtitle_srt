1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260
We could do a Seann and anakte mission too...

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 12

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It seems that you have seen the order.

4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The order was that I had a good night's sleep last night.

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I will deliver the Inner Pavilion this morning.

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm afraid that you all have some things that you don't understand.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will repeat it again.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
From now on, there are three steps to the Qingtian Sword.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You must be able to hold your hands and pay respect to the gold.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You must not let your eyes get to the ground.

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is the first step.

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All the officials' funeral ceremony

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
should be held in place.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You must follow the law of the Palace

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and strictly follow the rules.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is the second step.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The people of Yanjin are involved in the funeral ceremony.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The Gu-Xi people are not involved in the funeral ceremony.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is the third step.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Minister Cang, if you want to announce the order,

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
why don't you inform the officials about our military officials?

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you think we are not enough to trust them?

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Since we are here as officials,

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
then we must follow the rules of the military.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The military affairs are the most basic principles.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We don't need to discuss them.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It seems that Minister Cang

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
is not here to study.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I heard some rumors

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
that the Qingtian Sword was made of the farmland of the Qing Dynasty

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and was not selected for the title of the official.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Even the death of a common woman

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
is not suitable for the official.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Have you heard of it?

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Minister Cang,

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
we have read the three policies you have made.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The first one is to be reasonable.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We are all in charge.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
These are the rules of the military officials.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The second one is to be reasonable.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Minister, the court is not in charge.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The people are in charge.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The people's life and death are in force.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They will surely trigger the people's wish.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So we can only argue and close our eyes.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As for the farmland you just mentioned,

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
it's all what Minister Chu meant.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not that...

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You mean to say that

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you want me to find Chu Huai Ming to ask for his forgiveness?

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Or to catch the people in the public?

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No, no, no.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Minister, please be honest.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I have been to a private gallery.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How dare I say that?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The three policies I have made

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
are to stop these evil deeds.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Everyone,

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
if you have no choice but to do so,

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I will do it myself.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What does the new administration mean?

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If we really want to turn our country into a pure and pure man,

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
what about in the future?

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let's get together to make a happy couple.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The new government should be in charge.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We should always be in charge.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Look at him now.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He is just trying to make us feel better.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's not that he is in charge of the public.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's just a personal relationship.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If he wants to take advantage of our position,

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
if he is to be found by the government,

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
what will he do?

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are you afraid of?

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You let him investigate.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I have already taken care of it.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If he dares to provoke us,

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I will take care of him.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This administration is not sensible.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's for the sensible to be in charge.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Who did these things to?

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
My lord,

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Chu Huai Ming died on the way to Liu Fang.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You are quite smart.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Our Marquis Jian and I are always in contact with the dead.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We will always be in contact with the dead.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We will always be in contact with the dead.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We will always be in contact with the dead.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We will always be in contact with the dead.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I will investigate the records of the Qinglian Sword.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Chu Huai Ming is not good to you.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why do you have to worry about him?

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We are in the same boat.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But Jing Yu is different.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Chu Huai Ming is much better than me.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He soon got the title of Marquis Ping Jin.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He was as bright as you.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
At that time,

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I was already in the water.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was ready to go back to my hometown.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Chu Huai Ming left me.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He said that this was the time to use people.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Chu Huai Ming left me.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He said that this was the time to use people.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But I didn't expect that

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
he would leave me just to make money.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Chu Huai Ming is capable.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If he uses his mind in the right way,

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
he will not be able to get off the boat.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Chu Huai Ming didn't think about this.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But Chu Huai Ming didn't think about this old love.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He took advantage of you

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and gave you the most difficult work.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That was because he found out later

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that I didn't want to leave him.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So he didn't treat me as his own person.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But no matter what,

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
after he got the title,

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I was the first one to think about it.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And he didn't care about me

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and never drove me away.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm still very grateful to him.

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can read these letters.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's going to burn anyway.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Please forgive me.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Please forgive me.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Please forgive me.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you, master.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Len桦没名.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
How are you feeling now?

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Of course, you're joking.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What good is it to be so lazy to listen to?

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Everyone knows how to make the Qingtian Sword better.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Chu Huai Ming also knows.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's just that everyone is unwilling to do that.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They're unwilling to give up their interests.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Huai Ming, I'll burn these letters to you.

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Take a good look at them.

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you willing to help me with these letters?

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If it weren't for your order,

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I really don't know if you're telling the truth.

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm not Chu Huai Ming.

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If I don't do well, you can write so much letters to me.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
dit

146
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Have a listen to me.

147
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,500
My Lord,

148
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
If you really want to change everything,

149
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
there is a place you can go and see.

150
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
There will definitely be something to take care of.

151
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Where?

152
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Cheng Xi.

153
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Tai An Xiang.

154
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Master Chao, how is my sister?

155
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Mei Shang, let's go out and talk.

156
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
It's okay.

157
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Master, do you still have a husband?

158
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Wen Shang, I'm not hiding anything from you.

159
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Your sister's illness has been deep in the bone marrow.

160
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Maybe there is only one more month left to go.

161
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Until now, many things must be prepared in advance.

162
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Like our family, there is nothing to be prepared.

163
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
These past years, I have been giving Xiao Mi a treatment.

164
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
The house's situation has been going on.

165
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I know. I will prepare it for you.

166
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Look.

167
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Master, what do you mean?

168
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
The other day, I went to Ding Yi's mansion to greet him.

169
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
I only knew that the third prince of the mansion,

170
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,500
who was ungrateful, had been ungrateful.

171
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
He was young and had no wife.

172
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,500
The old lady said that she would let me match him with a good girl.

173
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I thought about it.

174
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
What's your sister's best match?

175
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
She wants to match Xiao Mi with a good girl.

176
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Your sister is lucky.

177
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,500
We ordinary girls can match a young master of the mansion if they die.

178
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
We can have a good match.

179
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,500
The mansion said that these are just money.

180
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
If the match is successful, they will be buried in the chain.

181
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
They will be wrapped in a cloth.

182
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,500
In the future, you can get another silver.

183
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
If you are bad to my sister,

184
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
it's not impossible.

185
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,500
An Sheng, you take this money.

186
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,500
But the mansion also has a condition.

187
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
The third prince will be buried tomorrow.

188
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
So your sister will have to be there for an hour.

189
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
But... But Xiao Mi is still alive.

190
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Didn't you say that Xiao Mi has one month of life?

191
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
I said that she has one month.

192
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
And she is still alive.

193
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
It's painful.

194
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
An Sheng, this is the secret medicine of the Celestial Sword.

195
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,500
It won't have any feelings.

196
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
You...

197
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
You want me to kill my own sister?

198
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
An Sheng, don't worry.

199
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Your sister has been ill for so many years.

200
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,500
The family's savings are almost the same.

201
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
And you are 28 this year.

202
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
You are not married.

203
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Are you going to bear it like this?

204
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Then I can't use my own life to exchange money.

205
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Liang Wen Sheng,

206
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
you have to take this beef leg.

207
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
If it wasn't for my kindness,

208
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
your sister would have died long ago.

209
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
You thought that the medical clinic would kill your sister?

210
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
What's the reason?

211
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Your sister has been replaced by your rich sister.

212
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
So you have been a good girl.

213
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
You wanted to get Xiao Mi back.

214
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Do you have any cure for me?

215
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Let go of me.

216
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,500
I came here today because of this.

217
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
You don't agree, do you?

218
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I will do it myself.

219
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
You...

220
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I will do it myself.

221
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
You...

222
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Liang Wen Sheng,

223
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I am here to see your Liang Xiao Yin.

224
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
I am your ancestral mother, Luo Ting Yin.

225
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
You are not a son of a bitch.

226
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Xiao Mi!

227
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Xiao Mi!

228
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
What happened?

229
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Xiao Mi!

230
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Xiao Mi!

231
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
What happened?

232
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Xiao Mi!

233
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
But you let my brother go.

234
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
I will not let you go,

235
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
if you don't know how to do it.

236
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Who are you?

237
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Who are you?

238
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
He called us at midnight.

239
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Can't we wait until dawn?

240
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
I have been sleeping.

241
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
He asked Xiao Mi to call me.

242
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
He is so annoying.

243
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Sir.

244
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
You are all here.

245
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Sit down.

246
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Everyone.

247
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Do you know who he is?

248
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
He is Liang Xiao Yin.

249
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Although Miss Liang is a child,

250
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
she is not a drug addict.

251
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Someone forced her to drink poison.

252
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
This is not a drug.

253
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Why?

254
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Liang Xiao Yin can't live without his own death.

255
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
But for a person with a heart,

256
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,500
he has a lot of things to do in the morning and in the evening.

257
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Shi Lei, bring him here.

258
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Be careful.

259
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,500
These are the abilities of Chang Wu Yi.

260
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
He uses the medicine to make eye contact.

261
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
He uses the old disease to cure the disease.

262
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
In fact,

263
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
he secretly searched for the woman who was seriously ill,

264
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
forcing her to be a doctor for the royal family.

265
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
He is so stupid.

266
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
If you send someone to save her today,

267
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
I and sister Xiao Mi

268
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
I am afraid they are dead.

269
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I will kill them.

270
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
I will kill them.

271
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I am afraid they are dead.

272
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
The marriage is arranged.

273
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
They will be buried in a few days.

274
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Do you think you can hide the heaven from the sea?

275
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Mi Shi Ning,

276
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Chang Wu Yi has found everything.

277
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
What else do you want to say?

278
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
My lord,

279
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
I know my mistake.

280
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I know my mistake.

281
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I know my mistake.

282
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
I know my mistake.

283
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Shi Ning, Chang Wu Yi.

284
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
You can't help.

285
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
You are the worst.

286
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
From now on,

287
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
you will be punished.

288
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
My lord.

289
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
My lord.

290
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
It's all his fault.

291
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
My lord.

292
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
It's his fault.

293
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
It's his fault.

294
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
My lord.

295
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
It's his fault.

296
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
My lord.

297
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
My lord.

298
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
My lord.

299
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
My lord.

300
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
It's his fault.

301
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
My lord.

302
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Let's go.

303
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
I have a list here.

304
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
A lot of people

305
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
follow them to see the criminal case.

306
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
I'll stay here tonight

307
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
and wait for you

308
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
to show your mercy.

309
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
As said,

310
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
we can't do it without punishment.

311
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
If you don't say it,

312
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I will find it out.

313
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
It's none of their business.

314
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
It's all about the Qingtian Sword.

315
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
My lord, I have something to report.

316
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Please see it.

317
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
My lord, I have something to report too.

318
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Please listen to me first.

319
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
My lord, I have something to report too.

320
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
My lord, I have something to report too.

321
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
My lord.

322
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
My lord.

323
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
My lord.

324
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I just met my lord.

325
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
I was going to the east gate to have a rest.

326
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I didn't expect to meet you here.

327
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
It's good.

328
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
I'll give it to you.

329
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Thank you, my lord.

330
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
You are now more and more trusted by my father.

331
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Now you have a official body.

332
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm afraid that I'll be far from you.

333
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
My lord.

334
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
My lord.

335
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
My lord.

336
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
What should I do next?

337
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
I came today to tell you this.

338
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
The army has been fighting for the military order recently.

339
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I want you to be the commander.

340
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Commander?

341
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Yes.

342
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
If you want to surpass the military order,

343
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
you have to have another body to attack.

344
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,500
You have to train hard in the army camp.

345
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
In the future, you'll have a change in the world.

346
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
But even if I decide to go,

347
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
I'm afraid my father won't agree.

348
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Then beg him.

349
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
If you can't do it, beg twice.

350
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
If you can't do it twice, beg three times.

351
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
If you can't do it, beg him to agree.

352
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
The key is to show him your determination.

353
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Yes.

354
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Come on.

355
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Commander.

356
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Here.

357
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Put it there.

358
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
OK.

359
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Yes.

360
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
This is here.

361
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
My lord.

362
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Commander, you go to work first.

363
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
OK.

364
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Now you're back.

365
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,500
The nails you said are clean.

366
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Congratulations, my lord.

367
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Master, the master's nails are clean.

368
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
I'm not used to it yet.

369
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
You have to be used to it.

370
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Don't talk about it in the future.

371
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Don't show it to the bottom.

372
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,500
You have to do the whole thing.

373
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
I know.

374
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Commander Gao.

375
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Then please give me some more money.

376
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
You want to ask me something?

377
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
You're the one who's been here.

378
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Do you think I'm good?

379
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Hai, this is your home.

380
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,500
I have to make you feel more at ease.

381
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Thank you, master.

382
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
But this is not my home.

383
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
OK.

384
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
You take this as my home.

385
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
It's where you take a break.

386
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
OK?

387
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Hai, as long as you have a family,

388
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
you can take your time.

389
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Go, go, go.

390
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Have a good drink.

391
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Go.

392
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
You're still thirsty?

393
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Not bad.

394
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
I made this for you.

395
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Give us some water.

396
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
It's not bad.

397
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
You should eat more.

398
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I'll eat more.

399
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
You're not bad.

400
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
You like it.

401
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Eat more.

402
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Hai is here.

403
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
I believe that

404
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,500
the sword will turn into the original.

405
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Come on.

406
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Let's drink this toast.

407
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
I wish you a good life.

408
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
And a good life.

409
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Cheers.

410
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Congratulations.

411
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Can we just have a toast?

412
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Then have a toast to Cao Jingxian.

413
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Tell the emperor that they're evil.

414
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
No.

415
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
I'm not a bad man.

416
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
OK.

417
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
It's useless to have a lot of food.

418
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
These books are useless.

419
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
They'll only expose me.

420
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I don't want to talk about you.

421
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
We should be more cautious.

422
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
We can't be too harsh.

423
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Do you hear me?

424
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
I've got it.

425
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
I've arranged the house for the first aid.

426
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
The emperor's wife is the housekeeper of the house.

427
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
The official is the doctor.

428
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
The family is very kind.

429
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Don't worry.

430
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,500
It's the high housekeeper who arranged the house.

431
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Isn't this the housekeeper of the house?

432
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Come on.

433
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Thank you.

434
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Thank you.

435
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
You're welcome.

436
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
I'm happy to have you.

437
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Come on.

438
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Let's eat.

439
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Try this.

440
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Try this.

441
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Look at this.

442
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Miss Xiang's body is in the window.

443
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
She's carrying a lot of things.

444
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
There's something.

445
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
What is it?

446
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
It's been moving for days.

447
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Boss Xiang has opened the door himself.

448
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
It's enough to bury people's faces.

449
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Boss Xiang is on his own now.

450
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
What's that?

451
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Come in.

452
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Boss Xiang.

453
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
You're so good.

454
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Don't let him wait.

455
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Enough.

456
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
I'll go and pick him up.

457
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Remember.

458
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Don't say anything if you shouldn't.

459
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I'm not talking.

460
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Mr. Zhang, it's not like you just came to the capital.

461
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
I almost couldn't even get in.

462
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Miss Xiang, you're all welcome.

463
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
I'm willing to win.

464
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
You call yourself me now?

465
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Then should I make a gift?

466
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Miss.

467
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
Miss Xiang.

468
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
You must not be able to eat.

469
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
You're my wife.

470
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,500
I'm the one who should make a gift.

471
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Put everything here.

472
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Wait for me outside.

473
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Why don't you take me to your new house?

474
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Please.

475
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
One more, please.

476
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,000
Mr. Zhang, you're doing great.

477
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Master Pingjing loves you.

478
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,000
It's worse than Downwind Circus with Miss Xiang.

479
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Although Tianjin is much smaller than me,

480
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
she's really determined.

481
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
What a pity.

482
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
I can't see the stars tonight.

483
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,500
How does it feel like he's going back to his home?

484
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
This house is so beautiful and shiny.

485
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
You just...

486
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
You didn't see anything at all?

487
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
What did I see?

488
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Don't make a fuss about it.

489
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Let's see what's in the box.

490
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Can you take it?

491
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Something's wrong.

492
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Something big.

493
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,500
You can make a fuss about Chu Huai Ming.

494
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Think about it.

495
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
You taught me to watch stars on the boat that day.

496
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
You didn't even make a fool of yourself.

497
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
You really can make a fool of yourself.

498
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
But it's just some of Gu's experience.

499
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,500
If Chu Huai Ming can watch the sky and the earth on the boat,

500
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
and can watch the ground low,

501
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
and can feel the heart of a jade,

502
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,500
then he wouldn't have said it so badly.

503
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
His skills are not all useless.

504
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,500
It's just that he can't keep the heart of a person.

505
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
You're such a good person.

506
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
With your ability to read,

507
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
can you always be so good at it?

508
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,500
The ancients said that the God of Heaven is hard to get rid of.

509
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Even if we know what will happen,

510
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
we still can't stop it.

511
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,500
But what happened to you is all good.

512
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I was still afraid that you'd become the chief tombstone

513
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,500
in a few months.

514
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
How long has it been?

515
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Once you're gone, you'll become a great figure of the martial arts?

516
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
If Miss Xiang doesn't help,

517
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,500
then I'm afraid that the result is completely different.

518
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,500
You said on the boat that every time we meet,

519
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
there's always something good.

520
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Then, Miss Xiang, do you still want to see me often?

521
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Why not?

522
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,500
I don't want you to come to the whole building to get some money.

523
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Even if I'm now a member of the martial arts world,

524
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,500
I'm still a poor ghost.

525
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,500
In this capital, the one I don't like the most is Guan.

526
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,500
The bigger Guan is, the more I don't like it.

527
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Don't be like them.

528
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,500
What? You want to send Guan Wei?

529
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Miss Xiang told me to remember some things.

530
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,500
What things?

531
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Someone once told me that when Guan gets on the boat,

532
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
he'll be lazy to walk.

533
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
He won't be able to get off again.

534
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,500
It's reasonable to listen to something.

535
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
You didn't say it yourself, did you?

536
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Thank you for reminding me.

537
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
I'm still very calm.

538
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,500
You're quite obedient.

539
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,500
I didn't know that Miss Xiang would come today.

540
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Why don't you go back to the garden and drink with me?

541
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
It's not interesting to drink with them.

542
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,500
If you want to drink, come to the Ba Zheng Pavilion to see me.

543
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I came today to ask you something other than wishing you good luck.

544
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Please.

545
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,500
On the boat, did you have anything to say to me?

546
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Miss Xiang is not weak and confident.

547
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
She's also very hardworking.

548
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,500
This is not something ordinary girls can do better than you.

549
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Then I'll ask you. Do you want to see me often?

550
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
You can't come back?

551
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Since you don't have any, then forget it.

552
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
I'll take my leave.

553
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Miss Xiang.

554
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Let me think about it.

555
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
I still can't answer you.

556
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
How much money is this?

557
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
Look at this little donkey.

558
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
It's normal.

559
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
What kind of donkey?

560
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Xiao Hai, look.

561
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
I've never seen such a big donkey.

562
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Miss Xiang is so generous.

563
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
And this wine.

564
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
It's been waiting for a long time.

565
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
I'll make some medicine for you.

566
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Xiao Hai, these things that Miss Xiang brought are gifts from someone.

567
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
It seems that she's very thoughtful.

568
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
She left so soon?

569
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
What did you two talk about?

570
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,500
She reminded me not to lose myself in the coffin.

571
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
That's all?

572
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
You didn't talk about anything else?

573
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Yes.

574
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Oh no.

575
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,500
We came to the capital and it's too early.

576
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Master, what's the meaning of this?

577
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Enough. Let's stop talking about this.

578
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Eat. Eat.

579
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Eat.

580
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Eat.

581
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Master, why haven't you slept yet?

582
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
I'm so tired.

583
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
I'm doing this for my master.

584
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Since you're not sleeping,

585
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
sit down.

586
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,500
I can't hide anything from you.

587
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Of course.

588
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,500
Actually, I didn't tell you the truth today.

589
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
About Boss Xiang?

590
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
He asked me a question today.

591
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I don't know how to answer it.

592
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
He left.

593
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,500
You don't know how to answer it?

594
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Or you don't dare to answer it?

595
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Master Liu Chu is not here.

596
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,500
I can't teach you anything.

597
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Let's go.

598
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Master will take you to a place.

599
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
Father, it's me.

600
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Why is it you?

601
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
What's wrong?

602
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
I'm in a hurry.

603
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
I want to talk to father.

604
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
About the money,

605
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
I can ask your mother.

606
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
It's not about the money.

607
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
It's about the money.

608
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm not asking you to do this.

609
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I'm asking you to do this.

610
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
I'm asking you to do this.

611
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
It's not about the money.

612
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
I want to be a soldier.

613
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
Why?

614
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
I've been thinking about mother.

615
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,500
She has been crying in her dream.

616
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Why did she cry?

617
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
She didn't say anything.

618
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
She just hit me.

619
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
She must be disappointed in me.

620
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
She disappointed me these years.

621
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,500
I can't help her with the wine every day.

622
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Father,

623
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
you must be ashamed of yourself.

624
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
So you want to be a soldier?

625
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
A long time ago,

626
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
mother told me

627
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
she hoped I would be a father.

628
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,500
I've been obsessed with her for so many years.

629
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
After last night,

630
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
I thought for a long time.

631
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Mother was right.

632
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
I can't let her be sad anymore.

633
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,500
You and I are different.

634
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
We are so cruel.

635
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
We are so cruel.

636
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
You think this is a game?

637
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
I don't think the army is open.

638
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
We can feed you

639
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,500
if we feed you.

640
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Father!

641
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Father!

642
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Please give me a chance.

643
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Wu Junyang is fighting for a new soldier.

644
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
I am the son of the emperor.

645
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
I have made a name for myself.

646
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
I will not risk my life

647
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
to fight for the new soldier.

648
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Please give me a chance.

649
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
If you want to go,

650
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
you must stick to it.

651
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
You can't come back for a year.

652
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
I will lead the army.

653
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Emperor.

654
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
After all this,

655
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
you've turned into a extrル Squad.

656
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,340
You were always Manshy.

657
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,660
You are home.

658
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,400
Get to rest,

659
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,360

The sea of ​​waves

667
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,080

The winter and winter sky

669
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,080

00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Let the heart full of love

Fill my heart with what I have

672
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Let this universe have me

673
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,080
I can still hear the sound of the mountains

674
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:48,080
I can't stop my hands from holding hands

675
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:55,080
This moment of pain has a new beginning

676
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:03,080
