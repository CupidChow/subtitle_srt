00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 18

2
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Why are you here today, Lord Zang?

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,240
I'm here today

4
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,760
to ask you for a favor.

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,840
The annual table tennis competition

6
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,480
is held in the capital.

7
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,120
The participants are all the sons of the Shi family.

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,880
The court has set up

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,920
a competition for men

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,080
to strengthen their muscles and vitality.

11
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
The champion will be

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,400
the emperor's family.

13
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,040
What? You want to participate too?

14
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,960
You're not tall enough to be the Marquis of Pingjing.

15
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,880
You want to show your face in front of the emperor?

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
It's not me.

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,480
It's the second son of the Zhuang family, Zhuang Zhixing.

18
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,280
Him?

19
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,480
Why?

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,880
I want him to take this opportunity

21
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,040
to show his true self.

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,720
And then?

23
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,680
And then let him become the most important son

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,120
of the Marquis of Pingjing.

25
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,800
I didn't hear wrong, did I, Lord Zang?

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,720
Are you stupid?

27
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,240
Or are you blind?

28
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,120
I'll find you a doctor.

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,560
Boss Xiang, please sit down.

30
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,600
How can a person

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720
live in the Wanghou family alone

32
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,960
without a support?

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,560
Boss Xiang, we're all friends.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,000
Please help me.

35
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,480
Don't ask me again.

36
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,360
Tell me. How can I help you?

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I want the eighth son

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,560
to make a big deal for Zhuang Zhixing

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,360
before the competition.

40
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
I want everyone in the capital to know

41
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,360
that Zhuang Zhixing

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,120
has the style of the Marquis.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,400
Okay.

44
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,480
Open the door and do business.

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
There's no reason not to accept it.

46
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,800
First, we need to change Zhuang Zhixing's face.

47
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,360
He can't be a useless man.

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,960
He has to be a graceful and

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
rich prince.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,480
Zhennong will send people to

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,760
spread his good words in the street.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,960
These people need money to go on the road.

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,800
They also need money to eat and drink.

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,200
At least three taels of silver per person.

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,560
The capital is so big.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,040
Even if there are twenty people,

57
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,120
it will cost sixty taels a day.

58
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,560
But with your low salary,

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
you can't afford it.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,960
You have to use other things to pay.

61
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,240
The color of the jade pendant

62
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,120
is too ordinary.

63
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,720
You can only pay twenty taels.

64
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,320
It's just a small amount of money.

65
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,560
If you ask the Eighth Prince to go out in person,

66
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,920
it will cost eighty taels to act in a film.

67
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,200
And you have to pay a new skin shadow for Zhuang Zhixing.

68
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,880
It's one hundred and fifty taels.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,080
One hundred and fifty taels?

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
For the sake of you and me as friends,

71
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,360
it's one hundred and twenty taels.

72
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,680
Your clothes are nice.

73
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,200
You will appreciate it after you calm down.

74
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,400
It's bright and tight.

75
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,360
It's good material.

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,040
I'll give you more.

77
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
Boss Xiang loves to joke.

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,120
I gave you the clothes.

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,400
I won't go back without it.

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,560
I can't help you.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,920
But it's not over yet.

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,960
When the game starts,

83
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,480
the money will be doubled.

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,160
Mr. Zang,

85
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
when the game is over,

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,640
you will give me everything.

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,160
If you can't pay it,

88
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,920
your descendants will pay it.

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,640
Money is money.

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,160
I have no memory of my descendants.

91
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,880
Stop.

92
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Boss Xiang,

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,200
I can't afford

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,600
the money you said.

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,320
But I have a way

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,240
to make the money you spent

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,720
come back to you.

98
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,360
I'll give you a chance.

99
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,440
Zhuang Zhixing has a bad reputation,

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,600
but he is the second son of the Marquis.

101
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
He is a noble and a secretive man.

102
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,240
If he uses it as a trick,

103
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,400
and let Mr. Zang

104
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,000
perform for you,

105
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,720
there will be a lot of guests.

106
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,880
Boss Xiang,

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,440
you can get at least

108
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,240
50 taels of silver.

109
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,920
The 7th day will be 350 taels.

110
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,400
I heard that the whole building

111
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,760
will bet on the opening of the game every year.

112
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,320
Zhuang Zhixing is a busy man.

113
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,120
He won't be liked by others.

114
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,640
But if he can make a comeback,

115
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,880
it means that the whole building

116
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,800
has a good price.

117
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,640
It will be a big profit for you.

118
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,480
At least,

119
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,720
you can get at least 400...

120
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,520
No.

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,680
500 taels.

122
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,760
You...

123
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,360
I haven't finished yet.

124
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,360
After the game,

125
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,000
Zhuang Zhixing will be successful.

126
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,280
He will be popular with the dishes,

127
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
songs,

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,800
and even the medicine

129
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,560
he has ordered.

130
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,560
If you calculate it like this,

131
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,320
Boss Xiang,

132
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,840
you will not only lose,

133
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,920
but also make a lot of money.

134
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
I didn't expect that

135
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,600
you are good at calculating.

136
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,120
You are not as good as Boss Xiang.

137
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,600
Boss Xiang only remembers the beginning and not the end.

138
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,320
He wants me to work in the whole building.

139
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,600
It's a business.

140
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,120
Since it's a business of making money,

141
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,000
I accept it.

142
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,160
But are you sure?

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,240
If Zhuang Zhixing keeps losing,

144
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,920
my whole building will be in a big loss.

145
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,680
Boss Xiang, don't worry.

146
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,840
I have already bought him food

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,080
and trained him.

148
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,600
In a short time,

149
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,440
he will be out of the game.

150
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,240
Feng Liu.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Has Zhuang Zhixing

152
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,800
come to the building to have fun lately?

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,800
Miss,

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Mr. Zhuang has just brought two people here.

155
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,320
They are drinking downstairs.

156
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,920
This...

157
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,040
Come, $10,000.

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,600
This is the eyebrows

159
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,480
of late Marqu Addict Zhong.

160
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,840
Goodbye.

161
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,160
Mr. Zhuang Zhixing,

162
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,600
get over here.

163
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,040
Run, over here.

164
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,360
BeSad

165
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,160
mein.

166
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,320
You move, run.

167
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,000
What do you say?

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
Hurry up

169
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
What are you doing?

170
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,040
Pull me up

171
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,280
You don't practice well

172
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,400
You dare to take them to drink

173
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
What did you promise me?

174
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,240
I didn't do it by accident

175
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,560
I...

176
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,960
I just took them to eat after a break

177
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,240
Don't say it

178
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,160
It's so smelly

179
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,480
Pull me up

180
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,960
Huai Feng, Shilei

181
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,200
I'll treat you to dinner

182
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,640
You just let me die

183
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,840
Zhuang Zhixing

184
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,400
You said you would avenge your mother

185
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,320
But you can't even take this

186
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,400
OK

187
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,080
Now.

188
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,160
Go back

189
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,640
I am going

190
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,520
Of course

191
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,640
If you don't care

192
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,440
Come back to the Marquis's mansion

193
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,280
He will be your good son

194
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,440
Your mother will remember you

195
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,760
It's just a revenge for your mother

196
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
Don't mention it again

197
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,760
Cheng Xu, take a walk.

198
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,580
Okay

199
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,020
Cheng Xu, you are here.

200
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,180
I have something to see.

201
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,980
No pepper.

202
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Ch lick it.

203
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,880
Cheng Xu

204
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,680
take the opportunity to see you.

205
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,240
Come in.

206
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,900
Your Forces

207
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,700
Just climb

208
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
I promised you to go back and practice martial arts.

209
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
What's wrong with dragging me up there?

210
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
If you can't climb up,

211
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
then go out of that hole.

212
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
I promised you to go back and practice martial arts.

213
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
What's wrong with dragging me up there?

214
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
If you can't climb up,

215
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
then go out of that hole.

216
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Go!

217
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
He really did climb up.

218
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
This...

219
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Remember what you said.

220
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Go on.

221
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Go on.

222
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Go on.

223
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
You saw it.

224
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Enough. Don't hit me.

225
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Drink the medicine.

226
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
What is it?

227
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
This is tonic.

228
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
It's a good medicine for strengthening your body.

229
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,320
I don't want to keep you.

230
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Fate is full of tricks.

231
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,320
How absurd.

232
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

233
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

234
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,320
I'm willing to give up my life.

235
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
How absurd this life is.

236
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,320
The north wind is singing the song of parting.

237
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Who doesn't want to give up their life

238
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,320
to exchange for the life of the world?

239
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:44,320
The love in the south is hard to hide.

240
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,320
It rains outside the window.

241
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,320
It's cold again.

242
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
When the world is over,

243
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,320
I turn around and hide.

244
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Thehee.

245
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
You were wrong.

246
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
I had the wrong man.

247
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
We should go back to the city.

248
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,320
We should go back to the city.

249
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
You are right.

250
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

251
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,320
I'm willing to give up my life.

252
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Thee.

253
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
You are right.

254
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

255
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,320
I'm willing to give up my life.

256
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
I'm willing to give up my life.

257
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,300
the competition is about to start

258
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,360
Great

259
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,320
Hong team wins

260
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,040
Go, go, go.

261
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
Cheng'er, you are a man from the East Island.

262
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
Did you drink today?

263
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,280
Go.

264
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:35,880
Go.

265
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,800
Give it to me.

266
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,880
Go.

267
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,960
I know he is useless,

268
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,720
but I didn't expect he is so useless.

269
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,880
He doesn't have any martial arts skills.

270
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,120
Who knows if he is the son of Pingjing Marquis?

271
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,480
Go.

272
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,160
Go.

273
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,880
Go.

274
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,080
You want to give up

275
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,960
before the arrow is fired?

276
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,400
I always thought

277
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,640
I was the most stubborn person in the capital.

278
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,640
Now it seems

279
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,840
I am much worse than you.

280
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
At least I haven't given up yet.

281
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,880
I will go on my own.

282
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,200
Go.

283
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,000
Take the ball.

284
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,240
The gold team wins the game.

285
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,240
If you want to win, just follow me.

286
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,440
I will shoot the golden 16th.

287
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,080
Yin post.

288
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,760
Yin post.

289
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Make sure them go to your real matches.

290
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,800
Make it a match.

291
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,520
Go.

292
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,560
Make it a match.

293
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,960
It doesn't matter

294
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,600
Come on.

295
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,880
What happened?

296
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,200
Why did you hit the ball?

297
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,920
Do you know how to play?

298
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,640
Who are you shouting at?

299
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,720
Can you play?

300
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,440
All of you should be more serious.

301
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,480
No one can count the table.

302
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,320
Really?

303
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,440
The Human интерestry is about to look what happened around him.

304
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,600
Stay calm.

305
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
One, two, three.

306
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Chicken eye.

307
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,560
It's mine.

308
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,440
It's mine.

309
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,280
Come on.

310
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,800
What's this?

311
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,280
Time's up.

312
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,680
Green Team incense!

313
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
We won!

314
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,640
Yeah!

315
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,400
Everyone,

316
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,240
this time, we won't play basketball.

317
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,720
We'll play against each other.

318
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,320
We won!

319
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
We won!

320
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
We won!

321
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
We won!

322
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
We won!

323
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
We won!

324
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
We won!

325
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
We won!

326
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
We won!

327
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
The black horse turns the front wheel.

328
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,440
The team is in a good mood.

329
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
They won the game.

330
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,440
The past is just a prelude.

331
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Now the black horse is standing on the road.

332
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
It's like breaking a bamboo.

333
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Let's see how he will

334
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,440
show off his skills in the future.

335
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I heard that Zhixing

336
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
won the game.

337
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Zhixing

338
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
hasn't been home for a long time.

339
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,440
He's going to play basketball.

340
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
He's really surprising.

341
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Why didn't he

342
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,440
say hello to his family?

343
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,440
We're all in the dark.

344
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
I didn't expect that

345
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
he has such a talent.

346
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
He's really impressive.

347
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
But he likes

348
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
these funny things

349
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
in his daily life.

350
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
My Lord,

351
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
I heard that

352
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
the second young master

353
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
has found a master

354
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
to practice martial arts.

355
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
He won't go out to have fun.

356
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
It turns out that the second young master

357
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,440
is much faster than the ordinary people.

358
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Zhuang family has been a general for generations.

359
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
It's not a surprise.

360
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
But he used to

361
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
be a bad person.

362
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Now he's surprised.

363
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
I taught him when I was young.

364
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,440
The court will reward the leader tomorrow.

365
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
I heard that

366
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
the eunuch in the private room

367
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
will also be present.

368
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
If you can't take care of him,

369
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
I want to take more people there.

370
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Congratulations, second young master.

371
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
If you win, you don't have to play.

372
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
I will

373
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
go to the court to meet him.

374
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Besides,

375
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
there are court officials there.

376
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Tomorrow,

377
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
you go with me.

378
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
You're my colleague.

379
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
It's time for you

380
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
to get to know some people.

381
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Yes, my Lord.

382
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
You go first.

383
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
I'll go to see my father.

384
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Okay.

385
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
Greetings, my Lord.

386
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
My Lord.

387
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
My Lord.

388
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
I pay my respects to my father.

389
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,440
You hate to compete with people.

390
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Why do you suddenly like

391
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
someone else?

392
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
I don't know.

393
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
Why do you suddenly like to stop playing?

394
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
I've grown up.

395
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
I want to share my worries with my father

396
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
like my brother.

397
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
But I know that

398
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
I'm not as good as my brother.

399
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I can only improve my martial arts.

400
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
I can help my father in the future.

401
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
I didn't expect that

402
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
you're famous

403
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
and amazing.

404
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
You won the championship

405
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
for the first time.

406
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Not bad.

407
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
I've been practicing hard for two months.

408
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
I didn't expect to play in the airport.

409
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
I just want to do my best.

410
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Who knows that

411
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
I've been through the battle

412
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
and I also think it's incredible.

413
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
You're my son.

414
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,440
How many generations of generals are there in the Marquis's Mansion?

415
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
This is your thing.

416
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
I'll remember it.

417
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Fine. Go.

418
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
My Lord.

419
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Your son is talented.

420
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
Thank you, my Lord.

421
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Duke Cao is here.

422
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Duke Cao.

423
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Duke Cao.

424
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Duke Cao.

425
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Duke Cao.

426
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Duke Cao.

427
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Duke Cao.

428
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Duke Cao.

429
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
Duke Cao.

430
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Duke Cao.

431
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
Duke Cao.

432
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Duke Cao.

433
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
Duke Cao.

434
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Duke Cao.

435
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Duke Cao.

436
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Duke Cao.

437
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Duke Cao.

438
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Duke Cao.

439
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Duke Cao.

440
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Duke Cao.

441
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Greetings, Duke Cao.

442
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,480
You look good.

443
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,800
You're so lucky.

444
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,240
Young master is so powerful in the court.

445
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,360
And young master is so smart.

446
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,760
I'm afraid you'll have a general.

447
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,040
I know a lot of people.

448
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,520
Thank you for your compliment.

449
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,440
How is the emperor?

450
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,520
Thank you for your concern.

451
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,920
He's fine.

452
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,880
You're so lucky.

453
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,960
You should go to the palace more often.

454
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,200
Yes.

455
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,440
Thank you for your kindness.

456
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,680
I'll wait for your call.

457
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,560
This is my new wood.

458
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,000
Zang Hai.

459
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,000
Say hello to Eunuch Cao.

460
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,360
I'm Zang Hai.

461
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,880
Say hello to Eunuch Cao.

462
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,880
You're the new wood

463
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,840
that the lord has just recruited.

464
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,800
You're the one who's sharing the emperor's burden.

465
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
Eunuch Cao.

466
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,640
It's the lord and young master's decision.

467
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,440
I dare not to make the contribution.

468
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,800
We are not afraid of Yuan za.

469
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,200
You also can't protect hired weavers.

470
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,000
Why can't be protected?

471
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,200
You can get out.

472
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,400
Where did lord have such a magnificent weavers?

473
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,000
I meant,

474
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,660
情況不正確

475
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:56,200
Artificial intelligence happens from its faucet

476
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,280
I mean,

477
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,040
Even the greatest talent

478
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,420
can show idiots these habits

479
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,840
Congratulations

480
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,640
Take the bothness mess

481
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,880
and sycee

482
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,040
Where is the antidote?

483
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,060
Can you understand my fans' sacrifice

484
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,620
and stand my scenery?

485
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:44,960
What

486
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,360
Eunuch, everything is ready.

487
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
It's your turn.

488
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,280
Your Majesty's order.

489
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,080
I've always known that

490
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,920
I won't play the ball.

491
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,320
I'm loved by all.

492
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,440
The winner of this game is

493
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,760
Zhuang Zhixing,

494
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,880
Mu Zhanqing,

495
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,960
Jiang Yu,

496
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,040
Sun Yongming,

497
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,560
Li Wan,

498
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,120
and Shen De.

499
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,920
You may all go to the court.

500
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,640
That's all.

501
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,800
Eunuch Cao,

502
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,960
you're so upset.

503
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,360
Don't think that

504
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,600
he'll ask you for help.

505
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,320
You can't go to

506
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,680
the place called Du Weisi.

507
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,120
Go to the warehouse tomorrow

508
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,040
and pick some good treasures.

509
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,800
Send them to his mansion.

510
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,600
Yes, My Lord.

511
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,080
Ask the kitchen to make some

512
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,520
for Zhixing.

513
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,160
It's a good help.

514
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,520
He's been working hard.

515
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,800
Yes, My Lord.

516
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Deng Hai,

517
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,760
you're a genius.

518
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,600
He always makes me

519
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,200
feel uneasy.

520
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,760
He's a close friend of Marquis Pingjing and his adoptive father.

521
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,320
He's just a peasant, but he doesn't dare to love.

522
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,160
Is it a good thing that he's left Zang Hai?

523
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,200
It's been ten years.

524
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Zhuang Luying is not dead.

525
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,960
I'm so shocked.

526
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:44,840
Jin Gu Goddess of Mount Qing

527
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,240
is now no more.

528
00:30:51,760 --> 00:31:00,800
How many Boeyi men are there

529
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:10,000
In the modern world,

530
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:29,840
takes the wind to roll the op uk

531
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,960
hook in hands

532
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,640
you must remember

533
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,360
to be at your service

534
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,600
Yes

535
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,920
I understand

536
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,840
Eunuch, you're in just the right mood

537
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,240
You asked me

538
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,920
to help you

539
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,760
came straight to the imperial mausoleum

540
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,880
and used some

541
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,920
unruly skills

542
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,640
to take the official position of the Imperial Concubine Li

543
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,520
and make it collapse.

544
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
And she said

545
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,480
it was a false word.

546
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,440
Anyway,

547
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,080
she helped Marquis Pingjing

548
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,280
to solve a new problem.

549
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,200
Unexpectedly, she was so proud

550
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,600
that she asked to go to the Marquis's mansion to release him.

551
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,640
Obviously, she wanted to take this opportunity

552
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,600
to go to the imperial mausoleum

553
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,920
and turn the situation around.

554
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Not only that,

555
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,480
she went to the Marquis's mansion for a month

556
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,000
and started a new trend.

557
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,720
Lord Yang

558
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,920
and Qu Jiao

559
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,840
just questioned her

560
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,160
in front of Marquis Pingjing.

561
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,360
But she

562
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,800
was killed by him.

563
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,760
So,

564
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,200
this person is very murderous.

565
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,280
I accidentally offended her.

566
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,720
I'm afraid the next one who wants to die is me.

567
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,600
Please protect me, sir.

568
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,480
I like the official seal you gave me.

569
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,040
I'll help you

570
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,000
with this matter.

571
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,400
Thank you, sir.

572
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,320
I'll find a better one

573
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,280
and present it to you together.

574
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,080
You're thoughtful.

575
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,280
Lu Jin.

576
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,440
Father.

577
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,960
Go to the Qingquan Town and check it out.

578
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
As long as this person has a problem,

579
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,160
it's useless to pretend to be Lu Yan.

580
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,800
Go.

581
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,320
Yes.

582
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,640
Lu Yan.

583
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,400
Send someone to keep an eye on this man.

584
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,760
Once Lu Jin finds out that this person is suspicious,

585
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,600
he'll be killed immediately.

586
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,760
Yes.

587
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,080
Lu Yan.

588
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,360
Have a look, please.

589
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
I'm sorry, sir.

590
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,400
The vegetables in the capital are all broken.

591
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,480
It's fine.

592
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,680
How about this?

593
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,120
I'll buy all the vegetables.

594
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,040
You can't sell them for so much money.

595
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,800
Take it. Take it.

596
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,880
It's fine.

597
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,640
I have something to ask you.

598
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,640
You don't live in the town, do you?

599
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,680
I'm here to find my relatives.

600
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,880
What relatives?

601
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,480
I've lived in the town for decades.

602
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,600
I know all the neighbors.

603
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
That's great.

604
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,000
Do you know a man named Zang Hai?

605
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,160
He's my cousin.

606
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,080
What a coincidence.

607
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,040
I watched him grow up.

608
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,600
But he left here a few months ago.

609
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,200
When did he come here?

610
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,800
Let me think.

611
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,760
He's been here for over ten years.

612
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,120
His parents died.

613
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,680
Then he was adopted by the villagers.

614
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,160
Where is the man who adopted him now?

615
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,520
He's gone.

616
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,280
A few months ago,

617
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,680
his family had a fire.

618
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,440
The wood was burned to death.

619
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Zang Hai went up the mountain to chop wood.

620
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,720
He didn't go home.

621
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,320
So he hid for a while.

622
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,520
I guess he was hurt.

623
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,320
So he left here.

624
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,360
Thank you, sir.

625
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,160
Did you find anything?

626
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,200
Sir Lu,

627
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,800
he's right.

628
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,000
Zang Hai's identity is clear.

629
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,320
So clean.

630
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,400
Shall we go back to the capital?

631
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,720
Is this how I taught you to do things?

632
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,520
He made you worried.

633
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,280
How can we bring back the news of his identity?

634
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,600
Did you think too much?

635
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,720
The one you want to investigate

636
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,720
can't be a clean person.

637
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,080
Obedient?

638
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,600
One minute leave after messages.

639
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
Take my order.

640
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,520
Go back to Jing...

641
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,520
He was hungry.

642
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,920
includes starters,

643
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:58,600
Face,

644
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,480
King Luan in B centr.

645
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:25,140
Now, you insist on killing yourself.

646
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,180
Come out

647
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,340
Put fish down

648
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,460
Excuse me

649
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,520
previous

650
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,940
violation of public order

651
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,780
escalating

652
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,220
You can drive faster if the bus is cambio l

653
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,200
Boss

654
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,500
Come and get wontons

655
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,340
Wait a moment

656
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,900
Don't turn back

657
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,040
You are monitoring by the factory committee

658
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,760
I know

659
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,560
The wontons are coming

660
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,740
I'm afraid we're in Jiangzhou now

661
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,500
Cao Jinxian is suspicious of me

662
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,980
With the dead man's footstep

663
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,660
he will be in the capital within two days

664
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,940
We should find someone to help him

665
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,820
No

666
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,340
If he dies

667
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,780
Cao Jinxian will be suspicious of me even more

668
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,460
Keep an eye on him

669
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,140
Let him go back to the capital safely

670
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,660
Hai

671
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,260
This man is too skillful

672
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,100
If he really goes back to the capital

673
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,220
it will be difficult for him to do it

674
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:53,860
Hai

675
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,340
You should think of a solution as soon as possible

676
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,180
We can't let him see Cao Jinxian

677
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,340
I'm afraid there's only one place

678
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,460
that can help me now

679
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,860
Give me some time

680
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,460
I'll think of a way

681
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,460
Hurry up

682
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,980
I'll take care of Changwei

683
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,020
Boss

684
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,100
Are you done?

685
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,380
Come again

686
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,940
Come again

687
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,380
Boss, are you hurt?

688
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,700
Move

689
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,900
I'll compensate you

690
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,620
I'm sorry

691
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,740
I'll make you pay

692
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,940
I see

693
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,060
ly

694
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:12,980
This is pretty great

695
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,620
Today

696
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,740
San

697
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,460
Hurry up

698
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,260
It's getting late

699
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,860
Okay, you go first.

700
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,260
Okay.

701
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,060
I'll be right back.

702
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,260
Hurry up.

703
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,260
Okay.

704
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,460
When the sun rises like a sunlit night,

705
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,060
sing with the army.

706
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,260
In the dream, it's me.

707
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,660
The hand is me.

708
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,660
The world is me.

709
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,660
The world is me.

710
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,660
You are me too.
