1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hey, hey, ha, ha, ha

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ha, ha, hey, hey

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey, ha, ha, ha

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ha, ha, hey, hey

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ha, ha, hey, ha, ha

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I am a good man

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I grew up on the border

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I thought he was on the horse

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Follow me to the room

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Pity

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
His mother died early

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Can't see this day

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Marquis

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,080
Mengyao's mother растine

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,300
the thing's

16
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,300
Do you feel Shekhovsky didn't punish her?

17
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:04,600
Yes

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,760
Do you think someone in His Majesty's residence

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,880
who killed Su solely

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:15,940
will be punished?

21
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,160
How?

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and not her

23
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,520
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,440
Go back now

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,240
Take her back

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,360
Go away

27
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,320
I'm the daughter of the minister

28
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,000
Shen Wan is from a low-ranking family

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,280
She's a low-ranking woman

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,120
Why did she die for so many years?

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,200
She can still be the daughter of the Zhuang family

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,040
I'm your wife

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,720
Zhixing is the son of the Crown Prince

34
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,920
Her mother's rank can be the daughter of the Zhuang family

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,320
Who dares to doubt it?

36
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,160
She's the son of the Crown Prince

37
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,720
What's the position of the Crown Prince?

38
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,160
That bitch is the wife

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,480
What am I?

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,440
Even if Zhuang Zhixing is the son of the Crown Prince

41
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,040
she's the son of the Crown Prince

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,920
She's also the son of my Jiang Xiang

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,520
I'm the only master of the House of Marquis

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,920
You're not a master

45
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Take her back

46
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,840
Madam, please go back

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,360
Madam

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,200
I know what you're thinking

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,400
The House of Marquis will depend on her

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,560
So she must be the rightful heir

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,440
But my family can't stand up anymore

52
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,240
Do you think the House of Marquis can stand up again?

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,880
You're deeply in love with Shen Wan

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,320
Don't forget how she died

55
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Take her away

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,320
Get away

57
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,260
Let's talk

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,440
Please

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Madam

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,840
You lost your importante ground

61
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,280
I'll toast you

62
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,000
Come on

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:40,220
Casey is arrested, yelling at you flower.

64
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,140
It's just a Mr. Xi's wish.

65
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,540
You're welcome.

66
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,140
Eat.

67
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,740
Madam.

68
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,140
Eat.

69
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,740
I'll do it.

70
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,340
Here, eat another one.

71
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,540
Mother, what's wrong?

72
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,140
Is it sweet?

73
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Open your mouth.

74
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,540
It's okay.

75
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,140
Is it sweet?

76
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,740
Here, eat another one.

77
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,340
Madam.

78
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,940
Madam, the Marquis said

79
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,940
that the eldest son has this disease and needs to rest.

80
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,540
He asked us to send the eldest son and the young madam

81
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,740
to the Yongzhou residence tomorrow morning.

82
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
Why?

83
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,140
The Marquis said that the second son will be in the court in the future.

84
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,140
There are many people in the house.

85
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,940
The eldest son's mother is not well.

86
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,540
I'm here.

87
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,340
Who dares to...

88
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,140
Madam, the Marquis said

89
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,540
that you are allowed to go with the Marquis

90
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,540
to take care of the eldest son.

91
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,740
Get out.

92
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,540
Get out!

93
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,140
Get out.

94
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,740
Get out.

95
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,540
Madam, pack up quickly.

96
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,940
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

97
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,940
Mother, why are you like this?

98
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,940
Mother.

99
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,940
Go to my room.

100
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,940
Bring me a high-quality, high-quality, Madam's coffin.

101
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,940
Mother.

102
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,940
Go and get it.

103
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,340
Don't push hard.

104
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
If you can't do something,

105
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,640
you won't be able to put up with how your husband is.

106
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,900
That's right.

107
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,140
Bear it.

108
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,740
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,140
Okay.

110
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,320
After all

111
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,980
I always expected money

112
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,700
There is both money and respect

113
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,900
But who will be the one to keep your dagger?

114
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:06,940
Mom

115
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,860
Father

116
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,160
Your father

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,220
He really abandoned us

118
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,520
It's

119
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,460
It's too late

120
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,420
At the very end, you even

121
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,460
lost the minimum использ of relationships

122
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,700
Good

123
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,540
Very good

124
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,620
Sir.

125
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,100
Today, everyone is celebrating for me.

126
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,740
This is the first time in my life

127
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,740
that so many people praise and praise me.

128
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,980
Is this the feeling of power?

129
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,060
Many people have always been pursuing

130
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,580
this thing.

131
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,940
Once you taste this taste,

132
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,780
you will never let go.

133
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,740
As you expected,

134
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,540
tonight,

135
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,060
my father called me to the study

136
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,900
and told me everything.

137
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,220
When I met him,

138
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,500
I suddenly found that

139
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,540
he had a lot of white hairs.

140
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,260
He had already returned the military power

141
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,460
and now he has lost his position.

142
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,860
He is no longer the

143
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,700
handsome and handsome Pingjing Duke.

144
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,380
I even felt that

145
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,300
he was a bit short

146
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,740
in front of me.

147
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,460
Zang Hai,

148
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,860
that day, on the fire field,

149
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,380
my father helped you get out.

150
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,500
Actually, I was very jealous.

151
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,740
However, he didn't even know

152
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,100
that you were the one who wanted to take over his position.

153
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,180
Your goal has been achieved.

154
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,740
My father has already lost.

155
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,420
His heart is full of pain.

156
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,420
He is already a late-dead old man.

157
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,580
Can't you let him go?

158
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,620
You care about your father.

159
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
You even want to kill him in the hands of your enemy.

160
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,300
Then you should understand me more.

161
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,140
I was indeed thinking too much.

162
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,420
You are like a rock.

163
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,180
You don't move at all.

164
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,540
If it was you,

165
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,460
I wouldn't have gone against you.

166
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,660
Finish

167
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,060
Nobody can three things good

168
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,900
shareholders must not five.

169
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,540
Hopefully, you have appeared tonight prepared.

170
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,540
Wait for it,

171
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,540
I am just going to chew on the air.

172
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,260
Does it hurt or not?

173
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,960
Zhao Jun.

174
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:37,560
His Highness used the

175
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,540
This is Jaguar paper idol.

176
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,060
panel.

177
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,060
It's about the Eastern Xia.

178
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,860
So my father

179
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,940
asked Chu Huai Ming to pay attention to the situation.

180
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,380
Three years later,

181
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,980
my father was ordered to escort the child back to the capital.

182
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,740
When he was about to arrive in the capital,

183
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,620
my father received a secret report from Chu Huai Ming.

184
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,340
The secret report said

185
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,100
Feng Shan Tai was leaving the capital.

186
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,300
Feng Shan Tai is here!

187
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,020
Save him!

188
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,660
Hurry! Save him!

189
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,020
But the Guaido under the camp

190
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,140
took something mysterious

191
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
and rushed back to the camp.

192
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,020

Hurry!

228
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,700
Hurry!

229
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,500
Hurry!

230
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,300
Hurry!

231
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,500
Go!

232
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,100
Go!

233
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,700
On the night we went back to the capital,

234
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,180
the day you took me away,

235
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,580
my father went out to meet two people.

236
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,100
They guessed

237
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,780
Kuai Duo wanted to take the poison after he found the ghost.

238
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,740
Later, they found out his secret route back to the capital.

239
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,620
They were sure

240
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,340
he would leave the capital with his wife and children.

241
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,740
They and my father

242
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
waited for your father

243
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,140
outside the Kuai family.

244
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
You already know one of them.

245
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,340
It's Cao Jingxian.

246
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,460
Who is the other one?

247
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,340
Dong Xia lost his treasure

248
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,780
and was taken away by an outsider.

249
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,860
They will definitely find a way to get it back.

250
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,940
You mean

251
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,700
the other one is from the Dong Xia Royal Court?

252
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,780
He is not only from the Dong Xia Royal Court.

253
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,460
He himself

254
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,140
represents the Dong Xia Royal Court.

255
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,140
It's the Queen of Dong Xia.

256
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,220
You are really smart.

257
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,660
You have thought of all the possibilities.

258
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,380
I think

259
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,460
they must have used each other

260
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,460
with the Queen of Dong Xia.

261
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,780
In order to take the ghost away from your father,

262
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,140
they conspired to destroy the Kuai family.

263
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,700
Even if she is the Queen of Dong Xia,

264
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,900
I will never let her go.

265
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,020
I know that I have to find you today.

266
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,980
No matter what you want to do to the Queen,

267
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,660
I can help you.

268
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,460
But I need to make it clear to you.

269
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,980
I have already made up my mind.

270
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,260
I will definitely find a way

271
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,220
to get the ghost away from you.

272
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,380
I have already fulfilled the agreement

273
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,860
and told you everything.

274
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,900
You can take revenge on the other two enemies,

275
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,420
but you can't hurt my father.

276
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,860
Thank you.

277
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,700
I will never let you go.

278
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,420
I will never let you go.

279
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,820
I will never let you go.

280
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,140
I will never let you go.

281
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,620
I will never let you go.

282
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,220
Today,

283
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,620
Zhuang Zhi ascended the throne of the Crown Prince.

284
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,380
Marquis Pingjing told him

285
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,500
all the secrets.

286
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,060
So the third enemy of your family

287
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,100
is the one who killed your father.

288
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,180
You are right.

289
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,260
I will never let you go.

290
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,260
I will never let you go.

291
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,660
I will never let you go.

292
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,100
I will never let you go.

293
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,700
I will never let you go.

294
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,220
I will never let you go.

295
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,660
I will never let you go.

296
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,700
Who is it?

297
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Your mother.

298
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,740
Impossible.

299
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,900
It can't be my mother.

300
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,820
Marquis Pingjing must have framed her.

301
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,900
You have been in the capital for ten years.

302
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,700
Has your mother

303
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,300
been asking you to find the ghost?

304
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,900
Before the banquet at the Marquis Mansion,

305
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,420
you and Cao Jinxian met.

306
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,020
It was your mother who took the night, right?

307
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,340
My mother told me

308
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,180
Cao Jinxian was a sinister and cunning man.

309
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
We were just pretending to be friends.

310
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,020
Once we find the ghost,

311
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,260
I will try to send it back to the Eastern Xia.

312
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,780
I will never share it with her.

313
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,220
Of course she won't share it with him.

314
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,420
Marquis Pingjing,

315
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,220
Cao Jinxian,

316
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,100
the Queen of the Eastern Xia,

317
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,900
is just trying to get the ghost blood for the time being.

318
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,780
In fact, they are all evil.

319
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,820
It's not like that.

320
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,620
Ghost blood is your treasure.

321
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,100
The Queen of the Eastern Xia will definitely

322
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,340
find it at all costs.

323
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,740
If so,

324
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,500
my family has more than ten lives in her eyes.

325
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,020
What does it count?

326
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,780
You're talking nonsense.

327
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,340
When your family was killed,

328
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,140
I was just sent here.

329
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,500
My mother was in the Eastern Xia.

330
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,060
She didn't come to Dayong.

331
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,340
How could she show up in your house?

332
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,180
How do you know she didn't come secretly?

333
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,340
My mother is the Queen of the Eastern Xia.

334
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,140
Do you think it's easy to come to Dayong?

335
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,380
Zang Hai,

336
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,340
you can't just listen to one side of the story.

337
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,900
When the house is full of smoke and dust,

338
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,940
I asked the frost and the cold.

339
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,020
You can't even listen to what I'm saying.

340
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,820
You hate me now,

341
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,660
right?

342
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,940
Qingzhou is surrounded by mountains.

343
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,660
The sky is dark and the moon is clear.

344
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,780
Let's write another night.

345
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,700
I want to follow the light of the night

346
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,180
and wait for the night to come.

347
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,940
The past days are brighter than the past.

348
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,900
How many dreams are on my mind

349
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,900
until dawn?

350
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,620
Call Zhuang Zhixing to the hall.

351
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,900
You are here!

352
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,540
This way,하겠습니다.

353
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,060

We've failed.

359
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,020
You don't like the drink, and you sent it here instead?

360
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,520
Tell me about this.

361
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,180
Ask the pueda-pay the bill.

362
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,080
Father!

363
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,060

00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,300
I can give you this tears- собственно.

365
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
But if we can't get it ourselves,

I will ask the conch release final intention.

367
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,260
I won't meet you.

368
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,720
If Youyang doesn't go to18thcompress for business check,

369
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:07,760
public holy

370
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,160

I just kalo ed once for Interest.

372
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,600
After meeting Heungu Aphor я,

373
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,960
I finally thought to drive him out of the golden field.

374
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,460
years later creative yin questão

375
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,460

380
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,820
and what he has to explain.

381
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,660
Summon

382
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,980
Zhang Jiangshi to the court.

383
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,340
Since my father directs me to come here,

384
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
I have to refer to him

385
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,940
since it is saying one day

386
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,060
after I become the emperor.

387
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,540
I want to know

388
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,540
Feng Xi's

389
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Your Majesty.

390
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
Lady Zhuang.

391
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Do you know what this Deng Wengu is?

392
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
I know.

393
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,540
Today is the day of the crown prince's

394
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,540
golden title ceremony.

395
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
I specially changed the

396
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,540
pre-ordained high-quality

397
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
Lady Gaoming's etiquette

398
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,540
to remember Deng Wengu.

399
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,540
I have something

400
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,540
to report to you in person.

401
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
Tell me.

402
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
I want to ask you

403
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,540
if the great warriors of Dayong

404
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,540
should be

405
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
fair and dignified

406
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
and have high martial arts.

407
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
Of course.

408
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
But if these warriors

409
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,540
are not wise

410
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,540
and have bad reputation,

411
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,540
and even involve

412
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
the reputation of being a prostitute,

413
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,540
what should we do?

414
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,540
I am here today

415
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,540
to report to you.

416
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
This man is a traitor

417
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
and deceives the emperor.

418
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
He is the father

419
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,540
of the five great warriors, Zhuang Zhixing.

420
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,540
Marquis Pingjing, Zhuang Luyin.

421
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
Zhuang Luyin

422
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,540
became the five great warriors

423
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
to protect his son, Zhuang Zhixing.

424
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,540
He bribed all the examiners.

425
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Your Majesty is wise.

426
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
There is no such thing.

427
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
But recently,

428
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
my eldest son

429
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
has been in a bad situation

430
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,540
and has no medicine.

431
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,540
He is too worried

432
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
and has a strange disease.

433
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,540
That's why he said such things.

434
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,540
I will take him back.

435
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
Go.

436
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,540
Let him finish.

437
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
Zhang Jiangshi,

438
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,540
do you know that

439
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,540
in front of the officials,

440
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,540
you slandered the high-ranking general

441
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,540
who has made great achievements

442
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,540
for our Yong Dynasty.

443
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,540
What a big crime!

444
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
Since I dare to

445
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
take the throne today,

446
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,540
and I dare to testify for my husband

447
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,540
in front of His Majesty,

448
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,540
it is not an empty talk.

449
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
I have the evidence

450
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,540
of Zhuang Luyin in my hand.

451
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
Your Majesty.

452
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
What's wrong?

453
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
Your Majesty.

454
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
The examination of the five main examinations

455
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
of the military and military departments

456
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,540
was held by the deputy minister of the Ministry of War,

457
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,540
Feng Zhang,

458
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
and the same examination.

459
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
The former deputy minister of the Ministry of War,

460
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,540
Wang Renliang,

461
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
and the former assistant minister of the Ministry of Government,

462
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,540
all three of them

463
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,540
were bribed by Zhuang Luyin.

464
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
This account book

465
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,540
is the evidence of his bribery.

466
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,540
In order to help Zhuang Zhixing

467
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
to take the crown,

468
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,540
Zhuang Luyin spent a lot of money.

469
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
He is not willing to

470
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,540
spend a lot of money

471
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
to bribe the examiners.

472
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm afraid that

473
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
the money is not enough

474
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
to buy flowers in their house.

475
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Your Majesty, please investigate it.

476
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,540
Did you three hear it?

477
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
Feng Zhang,

478
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,540
I ask you,

479
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,540
if you have such a thing,

480
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,540
I would never dare to do such a thing.

481
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
What about you two?

482
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,540
To be honest,

483
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,540
I won't spare you.

484
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,540
I was indeed

485
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,540
instructed by Zhuang Luyin.

486
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
I was confused for a moment

487
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,540
and made a mistake

488
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
in the five subjects.

489
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

490
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
Zhuang Luyin,

491
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,540
do you have anything to say?

492
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
Your Majesty, please be honest.

493
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,540
I don't know

494
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,540
what they said.

495
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
I don't want to do

496
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
anything that would

497
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
manipulate the imperial examination.

498
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,540
I'm dedicated to the country,

499
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,540
to help Dayong guard the border,

500
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
and to help Your Majesty

501
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,540
break the East Xia.

502
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
I'm completely

503
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,540
devoted to Your Majesty.

504
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,540
I can do anything.

505
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540
I'm asking

506
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
what you've done now,

507
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,540
not what you did in the past.

508
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,540
I, He Ziqing, the deputy minister of the Ministry of Rites,

509
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,540
have a report.

510
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,540
Go ahead.

511
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
Your Majesty,

512
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,540
Zhuang Luyin used his own money

513
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,540
to get into the Grand Office

514
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
and protect the eldest son,

515
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Zhuang Zhifu, from the Central Security Department.

516
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,540
In the past years,

517
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
he has been involved in

518
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
countless money transactions.

519
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,540
Is that true?

520
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,540
Zhuang Luyin is not only guilty of this,

521
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,540
he is also in the imperial mausoleum

522
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
and is forced to

523
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,540
bury the dead under his command.

524
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,540
People in the imperial court

525
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,540
are all angry but dare not speak.

526
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,540
I beg Your Majesty

527
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
to investigate and ask for justice,

528
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
and to return justice to the people.

529
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
Zhuang Luyin,

530
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
do you

531
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,540
admit these things or not?

532
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Your Majesty,

533
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,540
I didn't kill the innocent.

534
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,540
I did this

535
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,540
to avenge the dead.

536
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,540
Where is the Department of Law?

537
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,540
I'm here.

538
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I order you to investigate this matter thoroughly.

539
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,540
I obey your order.

540
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
From today on,

541
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,540
Zhuang Luyin will be taken into the Imperial Court.

542
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
After the trial of the three departments,

543
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,540
the whole Zhuang family

544
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,540
will be sentenced to death.

545
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,540
Yes.

546
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,540
I'm here.

547
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
I'm here.

548
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
I'm here.

549
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,540
I'm here.

550
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,540
I'm here.

551
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
I'm here.

552
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
I'm here.

553
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,540
I'm here.

554
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,540
I'm here.

555
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,540
I'm here.

556
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
I'm here.

557
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
I'm here.

558
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
I'm here.

559
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
I'm here.

560
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
I'm here.

561
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
I'm here.

562
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
I'm here.

563
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
I'm here.

564
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540
I'm here.

565
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
I'm here.

566
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
I'm here.

567
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
I'm here.

568
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
I'm here.

569
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
I'm here.

570
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,540
I'm here.

571
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
I'm here.

572
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
I'm here.

573
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,540
I'm here.

574
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,540
I'm here.

575
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
I'm here.

576
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,540
I'm here.

577
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
I'm here.

578
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
I'm here.

579
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
I'm here.

580
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
I'm here.

581
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
I'm here.

582
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
I'm here.

583
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
I'm here.

584
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
I'm here.

585
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
I'm here.

586
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
I'm here.

587
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
I'm here.

588
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
I'm here.

589
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,540
I'm here.

590
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
I'm here.

591
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,540
I'm here.

592
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
I'm here.

593
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
I'm here.

594
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,540
I'm here.

595
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
I'm here.

596
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
I'm here.

597
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
I'm here.

598
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
I'm here.

599
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
I'm here.

600
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
I'm here.

601
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
I'm here.

602
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
I'm here.

603
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
I'm here.

604
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
To be honest

605
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,540
I'm still worried about Yuzheng

606
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,540
She has the meeting in two days

607
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:47,860
She reported her pearl

608
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,540
She reported her pearl

609
00:30:48,540 --> 00:31:10,400
We have to

610
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
What's the matter?

611
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,000
The Three Judicial Offices have found out

612
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,640
that you are very clever

613
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,840
and you are in the army

614
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,280
and you control the border

615
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,160
What's the emperor's attitude?

616
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,320
No one can guess the emperor's mind

617
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,160
But no official in the court

618
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,360
pleaded for you

619
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,160
Cao Jinxian also told the emperor many times

620
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,840
to kill you

621
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,280
This bastard

622
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,280
wants to kill me

623
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,600
in his dream

624
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm afraid the emperor

625
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,400
won't spare you this time

626
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,960
This is a death sentence for others

627
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,720
For me, it's nothing

628
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,440
My family has led troops to fight for generations

629
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
and guarded the country for more than a hundred years

630
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,440
The emperor won't do anything to me

631
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,440
As for this bastard

632
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,000
Zang Hai

633
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,760
You go to find Xie Houguang of the Ministry of War

634
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,200
and Huang Shen of the Ministry of Rites

635
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,160
They know what to do

636
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,760
I want to see

637
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,640
who can laugh till the end

638
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,040
Go

639
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,960
Go

640
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,400
Go

641
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,160
My lord

642
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,240
Don't you think

643
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,640
you can walk out alive?

644
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,040
You talk about Cao Jinxian

645
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,320
I think

646
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,520
I want you dead.

647
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
What do you want to say?

648
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Ten years ago,

649
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
you killed the spy of the New Heaven Sword,

650
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,480
Kuai Tuo and his family.

651
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,680
And you set a fire.

652
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,920
Wei Zhuang Cheng killed the bandits

653
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,360
and avoided the court's investigation.

654
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,400
You thought you could kill them all.

655
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,600
But

656
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,200
their son survived.

657
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,600
Kuai Tuo's son?

658
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,200
Kuai Tuo?

659
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,360
You are Kuai Tuo's son?

660
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,360
I've killed too many bandits in my life.

661
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,080
Your father

662
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,080
is just one of thousands.

663
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,880
You want to get the ghost blood.

664
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,880
There are many ways.

665
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,560
Why do you have to kill my family?

666
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,640
Why do you want so many innocent people

667
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,240
to die because of you?

668
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,320
People will die.

669
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,680
It doesn't matter

670
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,600
who will die.

671
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,880
Is it important?

672
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,000
I see.

673
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,120
There is such a kind of people in the world.

674
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,640
For a little selfish desire,

675
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,960
people's lives are like a grass.

676
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,920
But don't forget

677
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
the good and evil

678
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,000
are all retribution.

679
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,560
Ridiculous.

680
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,120
I've been fighting in the battlefield for so many years.

681
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,200
I've been blooded by so many people.

682
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,320
I never believe in retribution.

683
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,960
Here I am at your side.

684
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,000
This is your final wish.

685
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,720
If you pretend to surrender to me and

686
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,560
stoop to mygrad.

687
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,480
You don't have to sacrifice my meaning to you.

688
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,960
You even planned to harm me.

689
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,000
You are really smart.

690
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,400
But Zang Hai,

691
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
I will win.

692
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,040
You think you have won?

693
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,400
You think I will die here?

694
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,800
I will win this time.

695
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,000
I won't die.

696
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,520
Till then,

697
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,640
I will kill you first.

698
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
My lord,

699
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,240
you should think about it.

700
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,240
You are a man of your own.

701
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,840
Although you are the commander of the Ninth Division,

702
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,400
your confidant

703
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,280
is still in charge of the Muji Camp.

704
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,040
His majesty is a man of your own.

705
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,680
He won't kill

706
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
a general from the whole of Dayong

707
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,480
who is a man of your own.

708
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,680
But if there is a hand

709
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,600
who kills you for him,

710
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,640
even if the court is unstable

711
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,840
and the army is unstable,

712
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,240
he will only kill this man.

713
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,840
If he kills you,

714
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,560
he can give an explanation to everyone.

715
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,840
Tell me,

716
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,320
what will his majesty do?

717
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,320
So all the misunderstandings between Cao Jingxian and me

718
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,320
started because of you.

719
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,920
Then you should know

720
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,040
that he is your enemy, right?

721
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,480
As long as I tell Cao Jingxian

722
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,520
your real identity,

723
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,160
he will kill you.

724
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,400
If you can pass this level,

725
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,240
will I tell you my identity

726
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,160
right now?

727
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,120
After the fierce battle at the Marquis's mansion,

728
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,880
you and Cao Jingxian

729
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,560
have completely broken off the alliance

730
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,040
because of the ghost.

731
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,280
You are his confidant

732
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,640
when you are alive.

733
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,080
The person he wants to kill the most

734
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,280
is you.

735
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,800
But who am I?

736
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,040
He will only know it

737
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,120
when you are alive.

738
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,320
He knows everything

739
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,040
but he can't do anything.

740
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,240
Pretending to be a wolf.

741
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,840
The feeling of being lost

742
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
is not suitable.

743
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,480
If you have the ability,

744
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,920
you should fight with me.

745
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,840
You are plotting against the people behind my back.

746
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,320
What are you?

747
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,920
I am no longer a human.

748
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,880
I have been living in hell

749
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,000
since I was alive ten years ago.

750
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,240
For me,

751
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,200
the process is not important.

752
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,920
I only look at the result.

753
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,400
Besides,

754
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,560
I already know

755
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,520
who are the three people who killed my family.

756
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,560
This is the only way

757
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,600
for me to live.

758
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,880
And you,

759
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,960
you only have the way to hell.

760
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
I know it all.

761
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
Do you think

762
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,200
I should do my best

763
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,640
to protect the family?

764
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,480
Do you think I really

765
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,320
want to protect the family

766
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,640
and my family?

767
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,840
Do you think

768
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,320
you can keep

769
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,080
the cause of his mother's death?

770
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,080
His eldest son has passed away.

771
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,120
Your youngest son

772
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,680
is obedient to me now.

773
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
Your youngest son

774
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,600
is密ically involved for the cultivation

775
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,280
and ripped off every part of me

776
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,880
all without any preparation or freedoing.

777
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,320
i I'll make sure

778
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,480
no one else in the Imperial Court

779
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,320
will suspect.

780
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,440
All of you

781
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,160
will be together.

782
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,160
Nobody's done anything

783
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,840
except mother's death but you.

784
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
You all

785
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,840
are running against your father

786
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,400
before you know it.

787
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,960
placed County Marshal

788
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
Good son.

789
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Zhuang Zhixing,

790
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
you are really my good son.

791
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,960
Hurry and hide! Hurry and hide!

792
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,960
If you see

793
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,360
that I am hiding,

794
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,560
you will be in trouble.

795
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Look at your son now.

796
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,560
Should you laugh

797
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,560
or cry?

798
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,960
Look at my eyes.

799
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,960
The shadow is my life-saving armor.

800
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,960
The eyes are my ultimate weapon.

801
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
The light is always on.

802
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,960
The knife is not black.

803
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,960
It's just because my heart is boiling.

804
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,960
The rain is my

805
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
fortune and my disappointment.

806
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
If I am too willful,

807
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,960
someone will eventually make a move.

808
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
The life is mine.

809
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,960
The rain is mine.

810
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,960
When the sun rises,

811
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,960
I sing with the army.

812
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,960
In my dream,

813
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
I am the leader.

814
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,960
The world is me.

815
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
The world is me.

816
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,960
You are also me.
