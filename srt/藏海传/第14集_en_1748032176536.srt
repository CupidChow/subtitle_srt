1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,180
What we fishery there

3
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,940
You

4
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,920
Us

5
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,220
Fine

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Xiang.

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Lord Zang, do you really think that you're so polite?

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm not afraid. What are you afraid of?

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I... I'll just wait for you outside.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You came to the clinic in such a hurry to find me.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sure there's something important.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Tell me.

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I want to get rid of someone.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I need your help.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Who is it?

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Who offended Lord Zang?

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not him who offended me.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's me who offended him.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This person is Eunuch Cao's adopted son.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Du Wei Si's family.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Lu Jing.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's your relationship with Cao Jing Xian?

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Eunuch Cao and I are just friends.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Eunuch Cao only met once in the basketball game.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But he sent Lu Jing to kill me.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I think you're lying.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is absolutely true.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That was the first time I saw Eunuch Cao.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't know why he would kill me.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If Boss Xiang can find out the reason,

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I will be very grateful.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Cao Jing Xian wanted to kill someone.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He never needed any reason.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But why didn't you go to Ping Jing Hou to protect you?

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why did you come to the clinic to seek help?

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Although Lord Zang was angry with me,

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
he wouldn't have offended Eunuch Cao for me.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I believe that the friends in the clinic are not that important.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If I just act, I can be saved.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This Lu Jing

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
has done a lot of things that are innocent.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He always makes things difficult for us.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He deserves to die.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But what kind of person is Eunuch Cao?

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Even Lord Ping Jing Hou wouldn't dare to offend him.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If he finds out that I helped you deal with his son,

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
my clinic will be closed for the night.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Boss Xiang, don't worry.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I promise that Eunuch Cao won't suspect the clinic.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How are you going to repay me?

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This...

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I haven't decided yet.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't have anything that I can take out of my hand.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I already have enough money.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't care about money or wealth.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then what can I do?

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Come here.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll do your hair.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Come here.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll do your hair.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You want me to help you, but you don't show any sincerity.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If that's the case, then go back.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's go.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you very familiar with this?

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
When I was little, my mother used to watch me.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In this capital, you can harass anyone,

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
but you can't harass Cao Jing Xian.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Even if you tell me about the book,

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
when have you ever told me about Eunuch Cao?

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The late emperor and the Empress Dowager have also been told about it.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The clinic has been in a difficult situation for a long time.

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So if you can kill Cao Jing Xian's adopted son without knowing it,

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
then it's a relief.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But if Lu Jin dies,

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Cao Jing Xian will be more worried about you.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't worry. I already have a plan.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's just that I won't be innocent.

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can't do it on my own.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If I help you this time,

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
then it's a big help.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You can't pay off a single hair.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then, what else do you want me to do?

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I haven't decided yet.

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But the clinic can pay off the debt.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But on the day I want the debt,

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
you can't be in a hurry.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a deal.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But I still need Lu Jin's handbook.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I want to imitate his handwriting.

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No problem.

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Eunuch,

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
after Zang Hai left the wonton shop,

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
our people have been lost.

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But after that,

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
when someone saw him,

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
he took the carriage and returned to the marquis house.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He never came out again.

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Useless.

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Leave.

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Did you hear from Lu Jin?

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Not yet.

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you don't, then it's the biggest news.

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Maybe there's something wrong with the Qingquan town.

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Wait for him for one more day.

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If he still doesn't move,

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
kill Zang Hai immediately.

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The Qingquan town

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Who is it?

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The water and fire are in harmony.

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The sun shines on the river.

115
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Sir, please come in.

116
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Sir, please come in.

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sir, please come in.

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sir, please come in.

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Sir, please come in.

120
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sir, please come in.

121
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sir, please come in.

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sir Lu.

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Sir, why are you here?

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sir, are you hurt?

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Bring the medicine box.

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okay.

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You two go to the ancestral house immediately.

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Give the eunuch a message.

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Zang Hai has a problem.

130
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Be sure to kill him.

131
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes.

133
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sir Lu, don't ask.

134
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Our master wants you to die.

135
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Zang Hai,

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
you actually put your hand here.

137
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Stop.

138
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Stop.

139
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Stop.

140
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Stop.

141
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Stop.

142
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Stop.

143
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Son,

144
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
when you fall down,

145
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
you worry

146
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
about the heaven.

147
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The sky is blue.

148
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The night is dark.

149
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The night is dark.

150
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The night is dark.

151
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The night is dark.

152
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The night is dark.

153
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The night is dark.

154
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The night is dark.

155
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The night is dark.

156
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The night is dark.

157
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The night is dark.

158
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is that Sir Lu?

159
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I think so.

160
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Why is he in Zang Hai's carriage?

161
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Let's go.

162
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Follow him.

163
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why doesn't Sir Zang say anything?

164
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Are you not afraid of dead people?

165
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I am.

166
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Such a gentle young man is not afraid of dead people.

167
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why is that?

168
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Compared to dead people,

169
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I am more afraid of Boss Xiang.

170
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I didn't expect you to do it yourself.

171
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This is the only way.

172
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
If you want to use fake and fake,

173
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
you still have to rely on me to fix it.

174
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm not afraid of dead people.

175
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If you want to use fake and fake,

176
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you still have to rely on me to fix it.

177
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Am I pretty good?

178
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You don't even know that

179
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
to take this dress, I have to...

180
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We're here.

181
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't worry.

182
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We've already checked.

183
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No one is here.

184
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Let's go.

185
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's go.

186
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What should we do now?

187
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Inform Eunuch that

188
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Sir Lu and Zang Hai are in Pingjing Palace.

189
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes.

190
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
My Lord.

191
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll be right back.

192
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes.

193
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's okay.

194
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What?

195
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Lu Jin is in Pingjing Palace?

196
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

197
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Did you see it clearly?

198
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
When we were watching,

199
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
we saw Zang Hai get on the carriage.

200
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There was another person in the carriage.

201
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We both saw it clearly.

202
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It really was Sir Lu.

203
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We followed him all the way to the back door of the palace.

204
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Zang Hai invited Sir Lu in.

205
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Lu Jin...

206
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He's not here.

207
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He's not here.

208
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He's not here.

209
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Lu Jin...

210
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and Zhang Luying...

211
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Keep an eye on them.

212
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
See what they're up to.

213
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes.

214
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Everything is easy to trick.

215
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's really hard to trick people.

216
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'll keep an eye on Changwei for you.

217
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Don't come out unless you receive my code.

218
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'll leave you to it.

219
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay.

220
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Zang Hai.

221
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm leaving.

222
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Take care of Boss Xiang.

223
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Zang Hai.

224
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It looks...

225
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
better than before.

226
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What are you laughing at?

227
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You're not even shy.

228
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You're not even like a handsome general.

229
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
As long as they think I am.

230
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Give me your hand.

231
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What are you doing?

232
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Lu Jin and Pingjing Marquis are having a secret meeting.

233
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I should do my best.

234
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Your Yin Yuan thread is very long.

235
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Your Zinü Palace is full of red.

236
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll cut off your future descendants.

237
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know if Boss Xiang...

238
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
will still be able to read the hand.

239
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You don't believe me?

240
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm right.

241
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What else can you see?

242
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Look at your Guan Yun thread.

243
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's the same as the paper.

244
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You'll be able to read it.

245
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You'll be able to read it.

246
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You'll be able to read it.

247
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But you might be in prison.

248
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
How should I solve this?

249
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
How about this?

250
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'll give you a good idea.

251
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Come out from your residence.

252
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Go three miles east.

253
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Then go three miles north.

254
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The fifth shop in the west wing...

255
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
is your residence.

256
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's a clinic.

257
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
What else?

258
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
If it weren't for me today,

259
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
you would have been in trouble.

260
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So come to the clinic more often.

261
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It'll keep you safe.

262
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Is there any noise outside?

263
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
No signal.

264
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We haven't received any signal.

265
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We have to keep acting.

266
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Why don't we act something interesting?

267
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
What do you want to say?

268
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You said Cao Jingxian...

269
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
didn't ask why Lu Jin came to kill you.

270
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
But Lu Jin came back from the outside.

271
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
He investigated your identity.

272
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He wants to report to Cao Jingxian.

273
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You want to kill him before...

274
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Lu Jin sees Cao Jingxian.

275
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It means your identity...

276
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
can't be known by Cao Jingxian.

277
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Mr. Zang.

278
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
What secret do you have...

279
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
that you can't tell anyone?

280
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I knew you had something to hide from me.

281
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Since you won't tell anyone,

282
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll go out now.

283
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Let them see my face.

284
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Boss.

285
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm going out.

286
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It depends on your sincerity.

287
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'll go out.

288
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
If this gets out,

289
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
we'll be taken away by the guards...

290
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and be punished severely.

291
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The Guards...

292
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
are not a place...

293
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that you can come out of.

294
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You're threatening me?

295
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You're my savior.

296
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Even if the guards find us,

297
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'll take responsibility for everything.

298
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I won't owe you anything.

299
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But...

300
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I can't answer...

301
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
your question.

302
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
If one day,

303
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I finish what I should do,

304
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'll be the first to tell you.

305
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You don't want to say...

306
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
that you're asking for help.

307
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What if Pingjing Hou comes back?

308
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Or someone who's watching...

309
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
sees the real Pingjing Hou?

310
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What will you do?

311
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Don't you usually go to...

312
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
the Golan Temple?

313
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Why do you want to spend the night with me?

314
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I wanted to celebrate...

315
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
the championship a few days ago.

316
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But I've been thinking...

317
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
that I want to celebrate with you alone.

318
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Tell me.

319
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
What do you want?

320
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You've misunderstood.

321
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I just want to talk to you...

322
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and drink with you.

323
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You really want to talk?

324
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't want to talk.

325
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
If you really want to talk,

326
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
then give me a whole night.

327
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Okay.

328
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I promise you.

329
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I won't go anywhere tonight.

330
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I've sent Zhuang Zhi Xing...

331
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
to detain Pingjing Hou.

332
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
As long as we don't let him...

333
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
appear anywhere else,

334
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
we'll pass this test.

335
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Okay.

336
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So I'm just like Zhuang Zhi Xing.

337
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm just a pawn you set up.

338
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You're using me...

339
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and you won't tell me the truth.

340
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I can't let you off easily.

341
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Enough.

342
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You're not a pawn.

343
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You're my friend.

344
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
If you keep on doing this,

346
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm afraid my marriage,

347
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
my official contract,

348
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and even my destiny...

349
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
will change.

350
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Father, let's go check the house.

351
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay.

352
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Where was that?

353
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
My Lord.

354
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
My Lord, it's getting late.

355
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Let me help you rest.

356
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
No need.

357
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I want to talk to Zhi Xing.

358
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We can talk tomorrow.

359
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's getting late.

360
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's getting late.

361
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You'll get hurt if you drink too much.

362
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Mother,

363
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I haven't talked to father like this for a long time.

364
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Father promised me...

365
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
that he wouldn't go anywhere tonight.

366
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I promise...

367
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I won't let father drink too much.

368
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You don't know your father.

369
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
He's always drunk.

370
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
He can't be taken care of.

371
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Father, what are you two talking about?

372
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You look so happy.

373
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Zhi Xing's childhood.

374
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Zhi Xing is already so old.

375
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
He's used to talking about his childhood.

376
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
He must be tired of it.

377
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You haven't worn this for a long time, have you?

378
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
If I remember correctly,

379
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I lost to the East China.

380
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You wore it when you went to the border to see me, right?

381
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It was cold at the border.

382
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I was cold when I wore this.

383
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You suffered a lot there.

384
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's not a big deal to go to war.

385
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Why don't you tell me?

386
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I've never asked you about this.

387
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I feel uncomfortable.

388
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Madam,

389
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
you don't like to hear about my military service, do you?

390
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
How can I not want to hear about it?

391
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I want to ask you

392
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
how you led 800 people to the wedding.

393
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
If you want me to say this,

394
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
you can't drink.

395
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's rare for you to say it.

396
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Let's drink tonight.

397
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Zhi Xing, sit down and listen.

398
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'll drink.

399
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Father and mother, you go first.

400
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'll wait outside.

401
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Come on, my lord.

402
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'll give you a toast.

403
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Tell me about it.

404
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
If you want to say this,

405
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
you can't forget about the famous general in the East,

406
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Sae Koo-lu.

407
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
For so many years,

408
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
he was the most powerful general

409
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I've ever seen.

410
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Could he be better than you?

411
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
How is that possible?

412
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
If he's better than me,

413
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
how could he be in Yanling Pass?

414
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Eunuch.

415
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Where's Lu Jingren?

416
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
He's not out yet.

417
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Where's Zhuang Luyin?

418
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
He's in the study.

419
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
He hasn't been out yet.

420
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
They talked for a whole night?

421
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yes.

422
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Zhuang Luyin.

423
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I want to see

424
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
what you and your men have said.

425
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Get the car ready.

426
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Go to Pingjing Lake.

427
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yes.

428
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Changwei has left.

429
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
We can leave now.

430
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You can handle the rest

431
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
by yourself.

432
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll go with you.

433
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
This show hasn't ended yet.

434
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I can only thank you

435
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
for saving my life last night.

436
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
If I can escape this time,

437
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I must thank you.

438
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay.

439
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Remember to come back alive.

440
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Don't come looking for me.

441
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Okay.

442
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Young Master An,

443
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
a guest wants to see you.

444
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Who is it?

445
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Eunuch Cao.

446
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm sorry, My Lord.

447
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
He's sleeping.

448
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Please go back.

449
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
No.

450
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You can't.

451
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You must handle

452
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Eunuch Cao's business

453
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
by yourself.

454
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'll wake him up.

455
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

456
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You still remember

457
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I was a second young master of the House?

458
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You all

459
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
are so talkative.

460
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You never treated me

461
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
as your son.

462
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I was not that clever.

463
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Now you dare to say that

464
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm a second young master of the House?

465
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I was not that clever.

466
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Now you dare to say that

467
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm a second young master of the House?

468
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Today,

469
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
you dare to say that

470
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm a second young master of the House?

471
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
My Lord is sleeping.

472
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
He doesn't want to see anyone.

473
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Do you know what to say?

474
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I know.

475
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Eunuch Cao

476
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Sラモ

477
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Eunuch wires

478
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Hello with a great pleasure.

479
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Why are you here?

480
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Where is Yuan Zha?

481
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I saw you drinking

482
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
and he's gone.

483
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Who did he drink with?

484
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I

485
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
don't know.

486
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You don't know?

487
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You are the one who

488
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
should know

489
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
who he had

490
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I've been talking to you for a whole night.

491
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Eunuch Cao, what are you talking about?

492
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I don't understand.

493
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

494
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm asking you. Where's Lu Jing?

495
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't know any Lu Jing.

496
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
My men saw you with Lu Jing last night.

497
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You didn't come out for a whole night.

498
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You dare to say you don't know him?

499
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
What the hell are you up to?

500
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I really don't know any Lu Jing.

501
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Eunuch Cao must have made a mistake.

502
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
When everyone sees Pingjing Marquis,

503
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I'll know if I made a mistake.

504
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Eunuch Cao, the Marquis is still asleep.

505
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Even if he's drunk, he should wake up now.

506
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Please sit down. The Marquis will get up in a minute.

507
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Fine.

508
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
He's awake.

509
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'll go wake him up myself.

510
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Eunuch Cao!

511
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Eunuch Cao, why are you making things difficult for a housekeeper?

512
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
When the Marquis sleeps, when he wakes up,

513
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
it's not up to us servants to decide.

514
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Don't think I won't touch you

515
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
because you're so fond of Pingjing Marquis.

516
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You're just a peasant.

517
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You interfere with everything.

518
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You're committing a crime of treason.

519
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Can you blame me?

520
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Guards!

521
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes!

522
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
This man is a spy.

523
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I personally went to arrest him today.

524
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
He fought to the death to resist.

525
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
He died under a knife.

526
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Eunuch!

527
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
We've found Lu Jing.

528
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Bring him here.

529
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
He's drowned in the Gwangji River.

530
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Bring him here.

531
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
He's drowned in the Gwangji River.

532
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Bring him here.

533
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yes.

534
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Tell Zhuang Luoying

535
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
that I took his staff.

536
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Let's go!

537
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Father.

538
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You've been standing outside all night.

539
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Without father's permission, I wouldn't dare to leave.

540
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Who was outside just now?

541
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
The Gwang family didn't care about me.

542
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I was just here to see you.

543
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
What happened?

544
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
The Gwang family didn't care about me.

545
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
They wanted to see you.

546
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
What happened?

547
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
They said Eunuch Cao was here.

548
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Eunuch Cao was here?

549
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Why didn't he tell me?

550
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I didn't want to disturb you and Mother.

551
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Master Hu.

552
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Where is Eunuch Cao?

553
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Eunuch Cao just left.

554
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
He took Master Zhang away.

555
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Did he say anything about Zhao Banhui?

556
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
No.

557
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I heard that someone drowned in the Gwangji River.

558
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Eunuch Cao left in a hurry.

559
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Prepare the horse.

560
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'll go to the Gwangji River myself.

561
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yes.

562
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
