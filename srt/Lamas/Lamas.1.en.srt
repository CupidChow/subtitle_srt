1
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:39,680
Dear?

2
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:41,177
Dear?

3
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:48,251
I could hear you crying.

4
00:00:57,594 --> 00:00:59,429
You’re missing your mom again?

5
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:06,571
Just sleep it off.

6
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:11,663
You should relax,
and take a rest.

7
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:14,444
Don’t drink too much anymore, Dad.

8
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:16,433
Hey, who’s the parent here?

9
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:20,366
This is fine.

10
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:23,344
You handle things tomorrow, okay?

11
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,497
I’ll head to Manila to buy supplies.

12
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:30,168
Okay, dear?

13
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:32,587
Good night.

14
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:36,591
Don’t cry anymore.

15
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:29,560
Lina… Lina.

16
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:30,873
Lina.

17
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:33,398
Lina...

18
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:37,198
- Cheers!
- What are you doing here?

19
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:38,651
I’ve been looking for you.

20
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:42,381
I just needed to get ready for you.

21
00:02:45,383 --> 00:02:47,969
I’ll take this later.
I might not get hard, if I drink it.

22
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:33,851
- Are you tired?
- No, I’m not.

23
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:02,440
Making delicious bread
requires a lot of practice and skill.

24
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:04,656
When kneading,

25
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:10,519
you push it down and outward,
using only the palms of your hands.

26
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:13,868
Be gentle with it.

27
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:17,139
Okay, okay, Chef Mona.

28
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:21,614
Are you done kneading that dough?
Just do it later.

29
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,854
You’re such a killjoy.
This is Sandra’s farewell party.

30
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,983
- Let’s start drinking.
- Let’s have a drink!

31
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:35,246
It’s just that my dad’s arriving early.
He said there’s a big order tomorrow.

32
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:38,047
You should let him bake his own bread.

33
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:42,211
You know your dad... He’s probably kneading
somewhere else in another town.

34
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,365
Hey!

35
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:46,651
Come on, let’s drink!

36
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:50,348
Take shot, enough with that kneading.
She’s getting horny when you do that.

37
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,620
- Alright, alright.
- There you go.

38
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:56,502
- Wow!
- Bottoms up!

39
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:02,744
Sandra really wants to get Mona drunk...

40
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:04,174
More?

41
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:07,931
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

42
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,436
- Hey.
- Mhm?

43
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:15,721
My mom texted, bring me home!
I need to go home.

44
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,920
I need to go, come on.

45
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,118
- Are you going with us?
- I’ll go a little bit later.

46
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:24,333
She’s not going... Really, huh?

47
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,470
- Then, let’s go.
- Okay, we need to go. Bye.

48
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:33,137
- Bye.
- You take care in Manila, okay?

49
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:36,951
Take care, take care!

50
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:39,511
Mona... be careful here...

51
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:44,667
- Bye, bye.
- Bye.

52
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:47,101
I'll just finish this.

53
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:55,124
The kneading…

54
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:58,576
over and over.

55
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,394
- Hey...
- Back and forth.

56
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:06,823
- Sandra...
- And it should never be rushed.

57
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:10,738
You’re just drunk.

58
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:16,429
I’m just practicing
what you taught earlier.

59
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,536
What are you doing?

60
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,297
I know I’m the one you really want.

61
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:33,732
You’re just
pretending with Jake.

62
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:36,184
- What?
- I've known it for a long time.

63
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:38,331
No, I’m not...

64
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,918
Charice told me that
you want me so bad.

65
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:48,522
I see how you look at me.

66
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:57,406
Over and over...

67
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:00,701
Back and forth.

68
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:04,121
Gently...

69
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,000
And it should never be rushed...

70
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,058
You need to get it wet...

71
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,611
Back and forth.

72
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:37,471
Over and over...

73
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:42,451
It should never be rushed...

74
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,162
Why do I feel like you’re still not sure?

75
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:28,789
Why are you hesitant?

76
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,585
You’re leaving, aren’t you?

77
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:35,504
I need to leave.

78
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:39,216
There’s nothing in store for us
here in our province.

79
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:02,062
You’re still leaving?

80
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,192
Of course, there’s nothing for me here…

81
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,571
and you, you have so many dreams.

82
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:16,827
Then, what about us?

83
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:20,956
Us? Come on, Mona.

84
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,294
I need to be early tomorrow.
I’ll get going.

85
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:30,023
Why don’t you stay here for the night?

86
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:31,675
I need to leave early tomorrow, Mona.

87
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:42,603
Mona! Mona! It’s already late,

88
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,688
and you’re not at the bakery yet!

89
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:49,735
- I’m coming.
- Hurry up!

90
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:55,783
What the hell are you wearing?

91
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,744
Are you a slut?
Your whole body’s on display!

92
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:03,005
I’m sorry, I’ll go change.

93
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,002
Dress properly,
Jake’s downstairs waiting.

94
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:10,916
Jake.

95
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,786
- Mr. Adon.
- Mona’s just getting dressed.

96
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,861
Okay, no problem, sir.

97
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:17,764
- Eat. Have some coffee.
- Sure, I’ll have coffee.

98
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:22,077
- Here’s your prescription, by the way.
- Oh, thanks.

99
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,877
At last, I can get a good night’s sleep.

100
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:29,708
Thank your mom for me.
I’ll stop by sometime for a check-up.

101
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,415
Okay, I’ll tell her that.

102
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,807
This is why our bakery isn’t thriving…

103
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,921
your delivery is waiting.

104
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,216
- I’m sorry.
- It’s embarrassing to the Chief.

105
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:59,012
I’m sorry, Pa.
I just stayed up late prepping the orders.

106
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,416
- I even texted you.
- Well, damn it, I lost my phone.

107
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:08,443
- What? How?
- How else? Of course it got stolen.

108
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:11,149
I’m suspecting it’s Lina.

109
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:17,299
Mona, you shouldn’t stay up so late.

110
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:20,331
Don’t worry, once we’re married,

111
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:22,731
you won’t have to work
in your bakery anymore.

112
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:25,831
Dad, it’s too early for that.

113
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:27,950
How is this too early?

114
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:32,048
If I hadn’t come home,
you wouldn’t even be awake.

115
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,841
I’m sorry.

116
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:38,635
Mr. Adon, maybe Mona’s still grieving.

117
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,434
Grieving? It’s been a year
since we buried her mother.

118
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:46,324
Mona, you’d better start thinking.

119
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:49,924
Jake’s here, waiting for you,
ready to marry you.

120
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:54,940
Remember, our bakery depends
on their family’s investment...

121
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:56,568
Yes, Dad.

122
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:03,949
Go on, Mona. Show Jake
the bakery operations.

123
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,579
- Okay, Dad.
- See you, Mr. Adon.

124
00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:13,220
What are you up to after here?

125
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:32,691
Here are the supplies,
it’s where we put our stocks.

126
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:35,400
This is my daughter, Mona.

127
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:38,406
Mona, this is Lucy.

128
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:44,227
Lucy’s studying
at a pastry school in Manila,

129
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:46,286
but she also wants to learn from us here.

130
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:49,097
Good thing there’s someone
to replace Lina.

131
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:51,190
What happened to her?
Why did she suddenly leave?

132
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,498
Let her be.

133
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:56,392
I’ll leave you to Mona.

134
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:59,419
- I need to go.
- Okay, Dad.

135
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:04,203
Pastry school, huh?
You’re probably better than me.

136
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:07,849
No way, girl... uh,

137
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,880
- I mean Ma’am Mona. Sorry.
- Just Mona.

138
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:17,567
So, why did you end up here?
Why didn’t you just train in Manila?

139
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:22,584
- There are plenty of bakeries there.
- There are, but you need experience.

140
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:27,202
Besides, this is my province,
and I always hear people

141
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:29,403
saying your <i>monay</i> here is really good...

142
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,449
I mean, the bread.

143
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,631
Well, in that case,
it’s good that you’re here.

144
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:40,430
Plus, it’s really my dream
to become a great pastry chef.

145
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:42,759
Are you serious about that?

146
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:44,889
Of course, ma’am.

147
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,724
If that’s the case, you’re officially in.

148
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,208
- Hi, Mona.
- Good morning, Chief. Our first customer.

149
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,963
- What’s for today?
- Our favorite, your bread.

150
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:08,311
- What’s with the wink, Chief?
- You know, Banal has a crush on you.

151
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,262
Come on, Chief.
I just like the <i>monay</i> here.

152
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:14,332
- How many?
- Make it three.

153
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:15,552
Alright.

154
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,002
You guys really come
all the way here, huh?

155
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:26,786
Mona, your <i>monay</i>
is just really something else.

156
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,275
You're such an idiot, Banal...

157
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:34,783
Sorry, Mona, I didn’t mean it like that.
It’s just really good.

158
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,822
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, take care.

159
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:45,337
Ma’am Mona, your <i>monay</i>’s
really famous around here, huh?

160
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,932
You’re like those two guys.

161
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:52,589
No... I meant the <i>monay</i>.

162
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,148
Stop with the formalities.
Just call me Mona.

163
00:20:57,702 --> 00:21:00,968
- Mona.
- Let’s go back to the kitchen.

164
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,036
Okay.

165
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:11,209
Kneading should be gentle.

166
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:14,024
Like caressing.

167
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:16,771
Try it.

168
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:23,089
Let’s begin with softness. Like affection.

169
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:37,889
- That’s something else.
- You’ve never done that before?

170
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,963
That kind of slap with so much force?

171
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:49,964
No, but I bet
it makes the bread taste even better.

172
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:57,352
You should use this, okay?

173
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:07,639
Like this.

174
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:42,268
How are you?

175
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:46,794
I've been trying to reach you for days,
but you've only called me now?

176
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:52,340
Wow, you’re so clingy.
I’m calling now, right?

177
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:53,515
How are you?

178
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,895
Same. Tired.

179
00:22:58,183 --> 00:23:00,936
Are you alone there?

180
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
Uh...

181
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:05,188
Yeah, why?

182
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:09,398
I’m alone in my dorm, too.

183
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,725
What are we doing, Sandra?

184
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:18,888
Well, maybe you need
to relax for a bit.

185
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:21,794
Ah...

186
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:25,346
Don’t you miss a certain caress?

187
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:30,397
Because I do.

188
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,121
What’s happening here?

189
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:37,374
- Are you drunk, Sandra?
- A little bit.

190
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:41,175
How was it again?
Your way of kneading?

191
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:46,117
Upwards... gently...

192
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,700
Upwards... downwards...

193
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,857
Knead it like this?

194
00:23:57,473 --> 00:23:58,769
Knead...

195
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:02,533
Kneading shouldn’t be rushed, right?

196
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,163
Upwards...

197
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:07,464
Downwards...

198
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:09,727
Gently...

199
00:24:15,906 --> 00:24:18,490
Oh my, Mona...

200
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:22,761
I can still feel your caress.

201
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:34,092
I missed this, Mona.

202
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:42,006
Imagine that I’m that pillow.
Knead it, upwards...

203
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,452
Knead it, Mona.

204
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:15,297
Can you feel it, Mona?

205
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:18,237
Mona.

206
00:25:18,827 --> 00:25:22,535
I can feel you through this videocall.

207
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:30,899
Right, Mona?

208
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,193
What are we doing, Sandra?

209
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:16,619
Huh?

210
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,127
What do you mean?

211
00:26:20,294 --> 00:26:23,752
You know this is just for fun, right?

212
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:27,664
We can't keep doing this.

213
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:29,861
What are we really?

214
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:38,311
What do you mean?
We’re friends, right?

215
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:40,370
Just friends?

216
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:46,599
It’s been like that for a long time.
Just for fun, right?

217
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:53,895
You know, Mona,
if you can’t handle it, then don’t.

218
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:55,997
Annoying.

219
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:40,862
Hello?

220
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:47,660
Hi, Mona.
Do you want to hang out tonight?

221
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,929
There’s a new bar that just opened.

222
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:59,429
Uh... Sure.

223
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:06,429
♪ <i>This is all for you</i> ♪

224
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:10,468
- <i>You’re a good singer.</i>
- Whoo!

225
00:28:16,787 --> 00:28:18,274
Are you really okay?

226
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:24,543
Are you okay?

227
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:26,896
I just miss my mom.

228
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:37,049
Four, five...

229
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:46,009
[singing]

230
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,020
Come dance with me.

231
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:08,814
Let's take some shots.

232
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:06,346
Did you enjoy it?

233
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,618
Mona, are you really okay?

234
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,172
Jake...

235
00:31:18,637 --> 00:31:20,827
I don’t want you to think

236
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,073
that I’m easy to get.

237
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:26,368
Huh? I don’t think about you like that.

238
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:29,542
I would never think that about you.

239
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:35,809
I don’t want you to expect of me.

240
00:31:36,822 --> 00:31:39,399
I just don’t want to lead you on…
like there’s more to this.

241
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,640
Uhm, Ma’am Mona.

242
00:31:55,283 --> 00:31:58,494
- I didn’t know you were here.
- Lucy.

243
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:01,789
I’m just here to unwind.

244
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,970
Don’t call me Ma’am, just Mona.

245
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:08,378
Oh, right.

246
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,923
I'll go ahead then.

247
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:13,426
Uh... Mona...

248
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,494
I’m not being nosy...

249
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:22,973
But if you need someone to talk to,
I’m here, okay?

250
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:28,343
- Alright?
- Thanks, Lucy.

251
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:31,080
Lucy.

252
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:33,780
Good job today.

253
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,617
- Tomorrow again, okay?
- Okay.

254
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:49,910
You’re getting the hang of it.

255
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:31,504
Blow it first.

256
00:33:46,686 --> 00:33:48,229
- Delicious?
- M-hm.

257
00:33:58,948 --> 00:34:00,032
Lucy?

258
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,870
Lucy?

259
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:08,249
Julian...

260
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,043
what do you mean flirting?

261
00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:16,090
That's why I got a job, right?
To save up...

262
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,135
so we can see each other again.

263
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,934
Lucy, dinner’s ready.

264
00:34:33,232 --> 00:34:34,690
Do you need someone to talk to?

265
00:34:43,655 --> 00:34:46,950
I come here whenever I have a problem.

266
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:49,665
And also because,
this is where I stash this.

267
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,376
- Shot?
- Shot.

268
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:08,809
You know, when my mom was younger,

269
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:14,992
her mission was to travel all around the
Philippines to learn every kind of bread.

270
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:16,400
Really?

271
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:21,010
That's amazing... that's what I want too.

272
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:25,327
Sometimes, I blame myself.

273
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,085
If my mom didn't have
any obligations to me,

274
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:32,186
she could have been free
to chase her dream.

275
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,502
What about you, Mona?

276
00:35:35,622 --> 00:35:36,879
What’s your dream?

277
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:41,627
I don’t know.
All I know is I don’t want to rot here.

278
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,855
I want to see the world.

279
00:35:47,886 --> 00:35:50,972
Is that so? Then do it.

280
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:57,651
It’s not possible.

281
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:00,879
Why? Is it because of your dad?

282
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:04,524
I think...

283
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,922
that she died from stress
because of Dad.

284
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:11,674
What?

285
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:13,708
My mom.

286
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:16,804
My dad has done so many stupid things.

287
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:27,933
I wish I had something like this.

288
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:30,268
A place to run to,

289
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:35,333
especially when Julian’s bothering me.

290
00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:37,896
Julian?

291
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:42,319
- Your boyfriend?
- No. My girlfriend.

292
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:43,558
Ah...

293
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:46,311
She called me earlier

294
00:36:48,147 --> 00:36:51,622
to end whatever we had.

295
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:53,414
Girlfriend?

296
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,166
It was awful.

297
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:03,332
I felt suffocated.

298
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,495
She was toxic.

299
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:09,730
How long have you been together?

300
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:12,663
Almost two years.

301
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:15,588
LDR is hard.

302
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:19,711
I’ve never had a boyfriend.

303
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:25,761
What about you?

304
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,782
- You’re also a lesbian?
- Hey.

305
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:35,171
- What are you saying? No...
- Really?

306
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:39,128
You’re a lesbian. You hesitated.

307
00:37:39,764 --> 00:37:40,787
Stop it.

308
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:49,489
Okay, fine.

309
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:52,699
I’m not really sure if I’m a lesbian.

310
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:57,468
What I’m sure about is that
I get attracted to women as well.

311
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,525
Well...

312
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:06,204
Cheers. We’re both lesbians here, then.

313
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,327
- Hey, I’m not yet sure.
- Yeah, whatever.

314
00:38:10,476 --> 00:38:14,122
- Whatever you say.
- Wouldn’t it be nice to go out?

315
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,823
- Especially, when Dad’s not around.
- Sure, but with that outfit?

316
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:22,825
- You’re going to party with that?
- Why not?

317
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,486
Look at what I’m wearing...

318
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:27,174
See? This is how it should be.

319
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:29,599
I’ll dress you up.

320
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,278
Fine.

321
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,257
- Am I doing it right?
- Yeah.

322
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:54,243
See? You look better.

323
00:38:59,592 --> 00:39:02,052
You look better when
you're all dressed up.

324
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:07,322
When I dress up like this,
my dad would call me a prostitute.

325
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:11,232
That’s not true, Mona. You look beautiful.
Let me see your back.

326
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:18,107
- You’re teasing me.
- I’m not.

327
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:23,297
Wait, there’s something missing.

328
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:25,587
Here.

329
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,953
You'll look more beautiful.

330
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:41,169
There, perfect.
Have a look.

331
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:46,341
See? You look better
when you're all dressed up.

332
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:48,151
Really?

333
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,052
Do you really think I’m beautiful?

334
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,604
What’s that? It looks cool.

335
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:54,555
Ah, this?
These are games at Playtime.ph.

336
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:57,653
I usually do this before I sleep.

337
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:00,240
Do you want to try it?

338
00:43:04,076 --> 00:43:05,077
See? We won.

339
00:43:06,912 --> 00:43:08,288
Yeah, cool.

340
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:12,970
- Scatter?
- Yeah, it means that we’ve won.

341
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:14,962
Now we have money for a date.

342
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,482
It’s easy to cash out your money here.

343
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,008
Let’s keep playing.

344
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:24,607
- Yes!
- Wow!

345
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:29,768
Add more pressure.

346
00:43:31,061 --> 00:43:33,321
Add more, to make it more delicious.

347
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,981
I’m just going to take
my lunch break, Ma’am.

348
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,670
- Okay.
- Thank you.

349
00:43:46,577 --> 00:43:48,162
You know what feels good?

350
00:43:49,746 --> 00:43:50,998
Your caress.

351
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:54,317
You’re cheeky.

352
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:58,088
We didn’t go out last night,

353
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:00,424
should we continue it later?

354
00:44:01,788 --> 00:44:05,650
- Let’s go out tonight? Dad’s not here.
- Game?

355
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:11,591
Do you want to go out later?

356
00:48:11,952 --> 00:48:14,694
- Let’s go to the cinema?
- Sure.

357
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:18,390
I heard there’s a new show,
it's “In Your Arms”.

358
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:19,789
Really? Let’s go, then.

359
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:27,107
Lucy, you've been here
for almost three weeks now.

360
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:30,902
Yeah, Dad, she’s learned a lot.

361
00:48:32,112 --> 00:48:34,948
- Is your arm okay now?
- Yes, sir.

362
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:36,631
That’s good.

363
00:48:37,488 --> 00:48:42,146
Lucy, do you know why the pastry
here taste so good?

364
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:52,514
I think so.
I think I can do it, too.

365
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,063
Should I take a final exam for you?

366
00:48:59,445 --> 00:49:02,395
Mona, get your things ready,
Jake is on his way.

367
00:49:02,694 --> 00:49:04,282
You’re going out with his family today.

368
00:49:04,755 --> 00:49:07,898
- Dad, maybe we can...
- What do you mean?

369
00:49:08,565 --> 00:49:13,651
Shut up. You’re going with them
to their resort’s opening.

370
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:21,003
Go on, get your things ready.

371
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:23,336
Get your things.

372
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:24,535
He's on his way...

373
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:26,442
Oh, he's there already.

374
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:29,044
Jake.

375
00:49:34,382 --> 00:49:37,456
- Jake.
- Mr. Adon, hello.

376
00:49:38,428 --> 00:49:39,471
Hi.

377
00:49:40,305 --> 00:49:42,578
- Let’s go?
- I’ll just get my things.

378
00:49:42,603 --> 00:49:46,233
- She’ll just get her things, Jake.
- Yeah, sure. I can wait.

379
00:49:48,076 --> 00:49:51,285
Lucy, this is Jake.
She’s our new employee.

380
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,478
Hi. Jake.

381
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,545
- Lucy.
- Nice to meet you. Hello.

382
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:59,316
Beautiful, isn’t she? If I was younger,
I would definitely date her.

383
00:50:00,066 --> 00:50:01,693
You’re silly, Mr. Adon.

384
00:50:03,495 --> 00:50:08,035
- Here, have a shot.
- No, thanks. I’ll be driving.

385
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,840
Wow. You’re all set? Let’s go?

386
00:50:14,172 --> 00:50:17,008
- Bye, sir.
- Enjoy, guys. Mona, take care of Jake.

387
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:18,593
Let’s go.

388
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:30,519
Lucy, later, you’ll be
managing here alone.

389
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:34,693
- I’ll take care of your overtime.
- Okay, sir.

390
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:49,812
Oh, Sir Adon, the bakery is all set.
I’ve already fixed it.

391
00:50:51,273 --> 00:50:53,984
Here’s for your overtime.

392
00:50:54,547 --> 00:50:58,121
- Thank you.
- Oh, and also, you passed the exam.

393
00:50:58,204 --> 00:51:00,943
Thank you so much, Sir Adon.

394
00:51:01,275 --> 00:51:04,773
With that, we should celebrate.

395
00:51:05,557 --> 00:51:06,850
Sure...

396
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:09,781
Here, have a shot.

397
00:51:17,986 --> 00:51:20,155
Congratulations, have another shot.

398
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:23,992
- One more?
- Of course, it’s a celebration.

399
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:31,458
- I need to rest, sir.
- I’ll walk you out.

400
00:51:45,555 --> 00:51:48,487
- Let me help you. Lie down.
- I’m fine...

401
00:51:48,512 --> 00:51:51,473
Relax, you’re dizzy.
You should sleep it off.

402
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,649
I think we should do
this more often, right?

403
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:10,907
Uh...

404
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:12,677
Thanks, Jake.

405
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:18,833
Jake...

406
00:54:19,334 --> 00:54:21,544
I told you we’re just friends, right?

407
00:54:23,922 --> 00:54:25,799
Why? Is there someone else, Mona?

408
00:54:29,344 --> 00:54:30,470
Sorry, Jake.

409
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:54,654
Hello? Yeah, yeah, I’ll be there.

410
00:54:55,036 --> 00:54:58,873
As long as there’s drinking,
I won’t be left behind.

411
00:55:01,252 --> 00:55:02,253
Sir...

412
00:55:03,955 --> 00:55:04,955
Sir...

413
00:56:12,825 --> 00:56:15,747
Oh, Mona, you’re back?

414
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:17,041
Since when?

415
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:21,915
What the hell, Lucy.

416
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:25,293
How long have you been fooling me?

417
00:56:26,502 --> 00:56:28,129
With my own father!

418
00:56:31,782 --> 00:56:32,825
Mona...

419
00:56:33,801 --> 00:56:34,886
No!

420
00:56:36,902 --> 00:56:40,266
There’s nothing between us, Mona.
If you only knew...

421
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:50,068
He abused me.

422
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:56,003
He took advantage of me, Mona.
Please...

423
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:06,240
I'm disgusted with myself, Mona.
Please forgive me.

424
00:57:10,213 --> 00:57:11,297
I’m sorry.

425
00:57:11,965 --> 00:57:14,676
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, Mona.

426
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:21,683
I’m sorry because...

427
00:57:22,934 --> 00:57:24,727
He blackmailed me.

428
00:57:28,581 --> 00:57:30,105
What blackmail?

429
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:32,933
He took a video of me.

430
00:57:34,424 --> 00:57:36,913
What if he leaks it?

431
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:39,067
I’m scared, Mona.

432
00:57:39,993 --> 00:57:41,035
I’m sorry.

433
00:57:42,842 --> 00:57:45,303
So that’s why they all started leaving.

434
00:57:46,249 --> 00:57:47,542
Who are they?

435
00:57:48,584 --> 00:57:50,128
The previous bakers, like Lina.

436
00:57:59,775 --> 00:58:02,640
Lucy, we need to go to the police.

437
00:58:03,016 --> 00:58:04,809
What my father did is too much.

438
00:58:05,632 --> 00:58:07,672
Mona, just wait a bit.

439
00:58:08,604 --> 00:58:14,162
The situation might get worse
if we report it.

440
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:17,034
What if he spreads that video of us?

441
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:19,701
Lina?

442
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:22,243
Ma'am Mona.

443
00:58:22,746 --> 00:58:24,765
Why did you ask me to come here?

444
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,582
Lina...

445
00:58:28,683 --> 00:58:31,827
I want to know what happened.

446
00:58:32,211 --> 00:58:35,882
Tell me the truth.
Why did you suddenly leave?

447
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:43,145
Did he do something to you too?

448
00:58:45,069 --> 00:58:47,451
Did something happen to you too?

449
00:58:52,123 --> 00:58:53,165
Yes...

450
00:58:54,484 --> 00:58:57,394
I even have evidence.

451
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:03,036
The medicine he’s drinking,

452
00:59:04,971 --> 00:59:10,116
he makes us drink that,
and that’s when he does a scandal.

453
00:59:14,546 --> 00:59:17,972
I took his phone when I left.

454
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,967
Why didn’t you go to the police?

455
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:31,934
Who would believe a woman like me,
who used to work at a bar?

456
00:59:33,478 --> 00:59:36,804
I just don’t want him
to leak our scandal.

457
00:59:37,628 --> 00:59:39,546
Maybe they’ll listen to you.

458
00:59:42,284 --> 00:59:44,062
My dad should be held accountable.

459
00:59:45,568 --> 00:59:47,487
How are you going to do that?

460
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:50,174
We’ll report him to the police.

461
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:54,848
Let’s help each other
to get him arrested.

462
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:59,054
I just want to live
a peaceful life with my child.

463
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:02,347
Lina...

464
01:00:03,821 --> 01:00:05,381
I need to go, Ma’am Mona.

465
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:16,399
I have a friend in Manila

466
01:00:16,811 --> 01:00:18,051
who could help us.

467
01:00:18,496 --> 01:00:19,586
Don’t worry anymore.

468
01:00:24,323 --> 01:00:27,493
Yeah. Thanks, bro.

469
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:30,642
- Let’s do this again. It was fun.
- Go up. Get our things.

470
01:00:30,897 --> 01:00:33,606
I’ll go get his phone.
Go on, get our things.

471
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:37,050
Just give me my share, okay?
I won during our drinking session.

472
01:00:37,712 --> 01:00:42,104
Yeah, yeah, I’ll make it up to you.
See you again tomorrow.

473
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,526
Alright. I’m already drunk...

474
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:47,346
Just call again tomorrow. Thanks.

475
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:56,163
Mona. Mona.

476
01:00:57,064 --> 01:00:58,107
Dad.

477
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:00,177
Get me some water.

478
01:01:01,101 --> 01:01:02,811
- Okay.
- Where’s Lucy?

479
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,370
She just went to get something.

480
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:13,066
Later... I’ll sober up a bit
from what I drank.

481
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:17,210
Then, have Lucy come to my office, okay?

482
01:02:00,586 --> 01:02:02,129
What are you doing with my phone?

483
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,716
- Give me back my phone.
- I know what you’ve been doing to them.

484
01:02:05,967 --> 01:02:08,844
- What are you talking about?
- You’ve been taking advantage of them!

485
01:02:08,869 --> 01:02:10,538
- What?
- Lucy, Lina!

486
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,122
Are you crazy? Come here you...

487
01:02:15,601 --> 01:02:18,743
Why do you believe those two?

488
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:21,317
They're sluts... you believe them?

489
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:23,864
You son of a bitch!

490
01:02:24,443 --> 01:02:25,736
You animal!

491
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:28,747
You have no compassion for us!

492
01:02:30,195 --> 01:02:31,321
Damn you!

493
01:02:31,742 --> 01:02:34,704
Lucy, that’s enough.
We need to go.

494
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,165
Wait, the keys.

495
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:46,679
Let’s go, Mona.
We need to hurry.

496
01:02:48,884 --> 01:02:52,221
- Lucy, I’m scared.
- Don’t worry.

497
01:02:53,222 --> 01:02:56,972
We’re going to Manila,
I’ve already talked to my friend.

498
01:02:57,184 --> 01:03:00,938
- We’ll be safe there.
- Lucy, there’s the police.

499
01:03:00,963 --> 01:03:05,107
- Calm down, they don’t know.
- What are we going to say?

500
01:03:17,246 --> 01:03:20,374
- Ma’am, where are you headed?
- To Manila.

501
01:03:21,003 --> 01:03:25,280
Alright, the election is coming up
so we have these checkpoints.

502
01:03:31,636 --> 01:03:32,678
Mona?

503
01:03:33,918 --> 01:03:37,338
Mona? Can I speak with you?

504
01:03:41,103 --> 01:03:42,313
Do you think he knows?

505
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:48,230
Chief, what is it about?

506
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:49,612
It’s about your father.

507
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,950
- Is there a problem?
- Yes, there is.

508
01:03:55,722 --> 01:03:57,703
Your father’s in big trouble.

509
01:03:58,346 --> 01:04:00,014
Someone came to the precinct earlier,

510
01:04:00,222 --> 01:04:02,041
and filed a complaint...
they’re saying it’s rape.

511
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,544
Your former employee... Lina.

512
01:04:08,464 --> 01:04:11,425
We need your cooperation,
and a statement.

513
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:17,098
Sure, sir. We’ll go ahead to the precinct.

514
01:04:18,015 --> 01:04:20,476
Okay, thank you.
Take care.

515
01:04:37,451 --> 01:04:38,452
Let’s go.
