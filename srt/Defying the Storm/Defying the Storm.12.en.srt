[Episode 12]

3
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,760
Let's make a bet.

4
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's see who's faster.

5
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,439
Is it you, or me,

6
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,640
or Agent 031.

7
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,959
Agent 031, don't tremble.

8
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,759
Next shot,

9
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,319
aim at Deputy Director Lu's head.

10
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,520
What do you want?

11
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,520
Shield your weapon

12
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,039
and leave immediately.

13
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,199
And I can pretend this never happened.

14
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,520
I don't care who sent you here.

15
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,000
I won't tell anyone about what happened.

16
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,479
If I broke my words,

17
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,840
I would be the next.

18
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,840
Director.

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,199
We're too exposed. This could be a trap.

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,639
In a while,

21
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,800
the Japs' planes would fly over.

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
We should retreat.

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,680
Let's go.

24
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,039
Fall back!

25
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,680
Haitang.

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,759
Don't worry.

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,319
I'm here.

28
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,120
Haitang, Mr. Ling.

29
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
Japs' bombers are on the way.

30
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,639
Follow me to the car.

31
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,240
Okay.

32
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,639
Oh my goodness.

33
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,560
Ms. Long.

34
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,639
Thankfully, I have a gun with me.

35
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,400
I took it for fun.

36
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,520
It saved our lives.

37
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,520
Come on.

38
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,879
Let's go, Mr. Ling.

39
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,599
Let's take the country road through the woods.

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,120
It's longer this way.

41
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,840
But much safer.

42
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,879
The bombers can't see us.

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,159
Zhang Qi.

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,759
Why are you here in Beiji Pavilion?

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,479
Our Squadron takes the shift

46
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,360
and comes to Nanjing.

47
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,879
I remember that Mr. Ling

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,000
said he'd come here.

49
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,639
Are you all right?

50
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
We're fine.

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,240
Thankfully, you're here.

52
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,400
Thank you.

53
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,960
Ms. Long,

54
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,000
thank you, too.

55
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,719
I owe it to Bing Bing.

56
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,199
If it wasn't for him showing me how to shoot,

57
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,080
I couldn't even turn off the safety.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,279
I will tell Hong'en about your story tonight.

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,480
Thankfully, you're here.

60
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,920
Mr. Ling.

61
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,199
Lu Ziyi is from the Political Discipline Department

62
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,639
of Central Aviation School.

63
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,079
Back in Beiping,

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,839
he was part of it when Fuxing was brought down.

65
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,600
What happens tonight isn't coincidental.

66
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,639
I suspect he's colluding with the Japs,

67
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,920
smuggling oracle bones.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,680
By the way,

69
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,600
Uncle Ling,

70
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,639
just now you asked him

71
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,480
if he was related to Mr. Jin's death.

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,079
What happened to Mr. Jin?

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,160
That's why No. 100 yard is closed.

74
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,319
I thought he went back

75
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,199
to his hometown in Hunan on vacation

76
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,680
Haitang.

77
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,480
The Mr. Jin living at No. 100,

78
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,720
is that history Professor Jin Zhilie

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,079
from Fuhua University?

80
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,360
Exactly.

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,959
That's Professor Jin.

82
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,959
He was safekeeping oracle bone
inscriptions of Wuding.

83
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,720
This oracle bone

84
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,120
is a valuable reference to our study

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,000
on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

86
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Combined with oracle bones

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,759
collected in Nanjing Institute
of History and Philology,

88
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,360
we could deduce how their calendar works.

89
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,439
With the help of historical records and classics,

90
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
we could prove it to the world

91
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,600
about the beginning of recorded Chinese history.

92
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,319
But now,

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,279
the Japs invaders

94
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,399
are plotting against it.

95
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,279
They want to take this oracle bone away

96
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,879
and they try to stop me from writing

97
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,839
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

98
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,959
Over all these years,

99
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,800
Professor Jin had been securing it

100
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,519
with his life.

101
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,680
At the last moment of his life,

102
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,120
he must have encountered with

103
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,360
great unspeakable obstacles.

104
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,279
Otherwise, he wouldn't have committed suicide.

105
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,519
He left us with a whole bunch of mysteries.

106
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,040
Well, Mr. Ling.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,319
Have you solved

108
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
the riddles Mr. Jin left?

109
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,240
Right now,

110
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm aware that he asked his friend

111
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,480
to store that bone in Hangzhou.

112
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,639
And I've found it.

113
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,839
Uncle Ling.

114
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,160
Why on earth did Mr. Jin drown himself?

115
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,399
I don't know for now.

116
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,160
I'm thinking

117
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,199
that Mr. Jin you talked about

118
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,680
did it to cut off loose ends.

119
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
That way,

120
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,560
others who seek oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,759
won't have any clue on its location.

122
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,879
Yes. That's very likely.

123
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,439
I used to think that

124
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,639
Uncle Jin is a weirdo.

125
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,399
But now,

126
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
I know that

127
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,600
he was a man who protects the great cause

128
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,759
with his own life.

129
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,040
It was me.

130
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,079
I failed to protect him.

131
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,439
What do you mean?

132
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,759
Mr. Jin entrusted the oracle bone to me.

133
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,480
He asked me to take it back to Hangzhou

134
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,199
and never go for him.

135
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,480
Only now do I know

136
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,480
he made out an entire plan

137
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,480
and died with the secret.

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,680
So that this oracle bone can be passed on by me

139
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,519
to Mr. Ling safe and sound.

140
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,519
What's more,

141
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,720
Lu Ziyi came to Central Aviation School

142
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,519
looking for a man.

143
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,839
It's not Nianqiao he wants.

144
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,639
It should be me.

145
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,560
I was too careless.

146
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
I should have figured it out earlier.

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,639
Zhang Qi.

148
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,360
Don't blame yourself.

149
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Just like you said,

150
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,839
Mr. Jin made this plan.

151
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,959
He must be determined to die.

152
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,120
Right, Zhang Qi.

153
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,839
Mr. Jin entrusted you with this treasure,

154
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,680
he must think highly of you.

155
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,160
That's right.

156
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,680
If it wasn't for you,

157
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,000
I wouldn't get this oracle bone at all.

158
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,120
Mr. Ling.

159
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,920
There are plenty of people going after this bone.

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,399
I'm afraid you can't protect yourself

161
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,279
from the violence.

162
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,199
If you think I'm trustworthy,

163
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,879
I can secure the oracle bone for you.

164
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,799
You have all my trust.

165
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,759
But now,

166
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,480
I have finished Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

167
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,519
I need to refer to it

168
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,240
while I write this book.

169
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,039
Don't worry.

170
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,360
I've put it back to where it was.

171
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,519
Right now,

172
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,519
we're in the middle of the war countering the Japs.

173
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,440
There's a culture war ongoing as well.

174
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,559
Professor Jin devoted his life

175
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,639
to protecting this bone.

176
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,480
I must not fail him.

177
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,240
We must win this culture war.

178
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,159
I get it.

179
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,919
In this expression of Coriolis acceleration,

180
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,320
omega indicates the angular speed

181
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,679
of the moving frame of reference.

182
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,879
Vr is the relative velocity.
[Central Aviation School]

183
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,159
This acceleration,

184
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,679
the Coriolis acceleration,

185
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,480
is one of the most common

186
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,159
and useful parameters to we the pilots.

187
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,039
Go ahead.

188
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
Captain, that's to say Coriolis acceleration

189
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,159
isn't in the inertial frame of reference, right?

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,759
Nianqiao,

191
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,639
Poshan, your younger brother has a talent.

192
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,279
He ranks the first

193
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,480
in aviation class and flight class

194
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,399
among students of the 11th year.

195
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,919
And he gets the highest scores

196
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,679
of aircraft manufacturing class
and dogfight tactics.

197
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,919
Today, when working on Coriolis acceleration,

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,519
do you remember, Nianqiao,

199
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,919
it barely made you cry when you worked on it,

200
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,879
Poshan catches the essence of this parameter.

201
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,559
Poshan was an art student.

202
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,480
What a surprise!

203
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,879
He's a straight-A student in Aviation School.

204
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,000
There's more!

205
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,600
He even modified the sighting device himself.

206
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,480
And it's not bad.

207
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,759
Captain.

208
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,799
Listen to yourself.

209
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,360
You sound just like an old teacher

210
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,320
talking about his favorite apprentice.

211
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,759
Poshan is the only son of Zeng's family.

212
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,600
He resembles my father,

213
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
a gifted genius.

214
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,279
Come on.

215
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,519
Don't talk like that.

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm adopted.

217
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Haitang and others know about it.

218
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,679
Nianqiao.

219
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,679
Stop talking about adoption.

220
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,399
They raised you up. You should be grateful.

221
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,960
Captain.

222
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,879
I heard that Meng's family is moving to the south.

223
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,639
Shouldn't you pay a visit?

224
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't have much to say.

225
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,679
I still don't know

226
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,799
what she's thinking.

227
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,960
In this tumbled world,

228
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,879
it's better for her to stay with her family

229
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,679
and keep a distance from me.

230
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,639
Having cold feet? You weren't like that.

231
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Speaking of Haitang,

232
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,559
I know her the best.

233
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,559
It looks like she's the silent type.

234
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,279
But she knows what she's up to.

235
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
Just think of it. When you were sick,

236
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,480
she tried her best to make you chicken soup.

237
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,399
Even though it wasn't tasteful,

238
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,600
she didn't even cook once for me.

239
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,519
If you ask Mrs. Meng about it,

240
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,919
you'd know that was the first time

241
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,399
Haitang got into the kitchen.

242
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:49,879
Captain,

243
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,480
are you afraid?

244
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,159
You're the instructor!

245
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,080
You should learn from Poshan.

246
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,200
Shall I ask him here to give you a lesson?

247
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,440
You're an instructor, too!

248
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,679
You're senior to me.

249
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,440
Still, you're single.

250
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,559
You're just alike.

251
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,320
Captain has seen so many flowers.

252
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,399
Yet he never really appreciates them.

253
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,480
Finally,

254
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
this one attracts him.

255
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,120
And he's having cold feet.

256
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,279
You're making me worried.

257
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,759
Nianqiao,

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,120
what about you? Having a crush?

259
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,799
Me?

260
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,039
What bothers me the most

261
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,720
is the situation.

262
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,080
Think about it.

263
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,679
Our army keeps retreating.

264
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,080
When will it end?

265
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,639
Look at the situation now,

266
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,519
we're losing the initiative.

267
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,759
We've lost all control of the air of East China.

268
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,720
Shanghai and Nanjing are the only two cities
with aircraft.

269
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,240
Night raid is all we could do now.

270
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,039
I thought we were talking about relationships.

271
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,919
Why does the topic turn to the situation?

272
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,600
We are risking our lives.

273
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,200
If I could,

274
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,440
I would guard the girl I love.

275
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,600
And let her fly freely

276
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,080
just like a butterfly.

277
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,639
That would be lovely.

278
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,200
I don't want to keep her in my hands.

279
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,080
Huansheng,

280
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,080
you went out from time to time,

281
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,840
wiring money to your poor friends.

282
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,879
You always act in a mysterious way.

283
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,279
We didn't bother to ask.

284
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,200
Think about it now,

285
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,080
are you sending money to your secret wife?

286
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,080
It's not like that!

287
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,519
I couldn't contact my parents

288
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,759
or my younger brother.

289
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm on my own.

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,080
I went out to wire money to my friends.

291
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,320
Unlike you,

292
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,320
who are living a colorful life,

293
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,480
you guys and the poor old friends

294
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,879
are all I have.

295
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,360
Why's that?

296
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,960
Do I look lame?

297
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,360
That's all right.

298
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:50,879
When the war is over,

299
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,240
I'll ask Haitang

300
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,960
to introduce you to her classmates.

301
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,600
Who's the one talking about freeing her?

302
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,159
Now you're calling her by the name!

303
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,399
She is like my sister!

304
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,399
I know.

305
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,759
A younger sister to you.

306
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
That's all.

307
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,840
Fine.

308
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,600
Sister-in-law, alright?

309
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,639
Nianqiao!

310
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,320
After you saved his life,

311
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,279
he keeps blaming himself

312
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,000
for not having saved that young soldier.

313
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,679
I want to give him a lesson

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,919
in our way, as an solider.

315
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,120
Officer Li.

316
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,360
Let's go.

317
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,759
Let's go to Hanxun's place.

318
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't worry about me. I'm heading out.

319
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,399
Out again?

320
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,480
To the post.

321
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,039
Martial law is put into force.

322
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,679
You must put a lot of effort to get him in.

323
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,159
Thank you so much.

324
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,440
Haichen.

325
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,840
I want to talk to you in private.

326
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,600
Come with me.

327
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,720
Hold on.

328
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I need to talk to you.

329
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,360
Alright.

330
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,879
Wait for me here, Haichen.

331
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,360
What about it, Officer Li?

332
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,720
I made these.

333
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,039
See if they fit.

334
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,039
Really?

335
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,000
Perfect!

336
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:20,799
And they're warm.

337
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,000
How much are these? I should pay you.

338
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,399
Ten bucks.

339
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,240
Really?

340
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,600
I...

341
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,000
Come on.

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,080
I made them myself!

343
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,360
It took me months.

344
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,120
Even harder than driving a plane.

345
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
What a surprise!

346
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,279
I never know you could make these.

347
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,000
Seriously?

348
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,240
What do you think I am? A man?

349
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,039
Sorry, I misspeak!

350
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,279
Just answer me.

351
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,200
Do you want them or not?

352
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,320
You're my close friend!

353
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,759
Of course, I'll take it!

354
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,840
It's just...

355
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,240
you are so unique.

356
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,279
In what way?

357
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,559
Calm down. I'll spare you.

358
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,039
I will fly to Kunming tomorrow.

359
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,519
Then there are consecutive flights

360
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,039
between Hangzhou and Wujiaba.

361
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,120
Once you settle down,

362
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,000
we can meet in Kunming.

363
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,000
Send me a message then.

364
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,159
Sure.

365
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,080
By the way,

366
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,120
the car to send him home is outside.

367
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,519
Make sure the car returns by seven.

368
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,159
There's the curfew.

369
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,600
Sure.

370
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,000
Thank you.

371
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,799
Can you hear the guns?

372
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,000
Recently,

373
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,679
Hanguang Squadron is taking a shift to Nanjing.

374
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,879
Although we weren't flying now,

375
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,720
over there,

376
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,399
the 14 fighter jets of ours

377
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,440
took down at least 30 Japs' fighters.

378
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,840
In a while,

379
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,839
Hangzhou will be at war.

380
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,480
That's why we're summoned here.

381
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,039
It's been months.

382
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,319
You haven't recovered from it.

383
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,240
You must clear your mind

384
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,200
when we are away.

385
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,200
It's 3rd today.

386
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,640
Our family will move on the 10th.

387
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,839
Poshan and I can't leave with you.

388
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,079
All the family members

389
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,839
are counting on you.

390
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,480
You must man up.

391
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,599
Could you tell me about it?

392
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,079
What are you thinking?

393
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,799
Listen up.

394
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,160
We will take the shift to Hangzhou.

395
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,000
I will pick you up then.

396
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:06,799
By that time,

397
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,880
if you still don't want to talk,

398
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,200
I might never hear from you.

399
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,839
This red rope

400
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,640
is from that young soldier.

401
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,559
Take it!

402
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,799
He blessed me with his life.

403
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,160
When in Nanyuan Airport,

404
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,000
I failed him.

405
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,519
He was dying.

406
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,759
He asked me for help.

407
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,240
But I was too afraid.

408
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,680
There were bullets.

409
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,119
I hid among the dead, and watched him.

410
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
Watched him as he died.

411
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,519
He was dead because of me.

412
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,720
Haichen.

413
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,480
You grew up under my watch.

414
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,720
I know that

415
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,799
you're a nice kid.

416
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,960
That's why you blame yourself.

417
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,480
But now,

418
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,559
the country is at war.

419
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,680
We must take responsibility.

420
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,720
What's done is done. There's no turning back.

421
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,039
So, we must forgive and move on from history.

422
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,160
You failed to save him.

423
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,039
But you tried.

424
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,200
It's just you were not powerful enough. Okay?

425
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,759
No.

426
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,960
You don't understand.

427
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,519
He was alive minutes ago.

428
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,920
You have no idea to watch a man die
right in front of you.

429
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,400
I didn't do anything.

430
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,319
I know that feeling.

431
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,079
Haichen.

432
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,799
Captain Zhang shouldn't have saved me.

433
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,440
I've been through that.

434
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,640
I'd rather just die.

435
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,599
Don't do this, Haichen.

436
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,319
As long as I'm awake,

437
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,759
Stop it, Haichen.

438
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,720
Haichen!

439
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,119
I can see him reaching me.

440
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,640
Come with me!

441
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,200
Nianqiao.

442
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,559
What is this for?

443
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,599
You just said

444
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,000
you'd rather die

445
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,519
so you can be free from the blame.

446
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,039
I dare you to return your life to that soldier.

447
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,079
If that was only talking,

448
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,519
I will take you home now.

449
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,519
If you dare do it to pay him back,

450
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:53,480
close your eyes and jump from here.

451
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,039
If you survive,

452
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,759
that's your second chance.

453
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,000
A fresh start.

454
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:02,519
Meng Haichen!

455
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,400
You chose to join the army.

456
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,279
Soldiers are not afraid of death!

457
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,759
What are you afraid of now?

458
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,599
I'm asking you as a soldier,

459
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:11,920
answer me.

460
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,000
Do you dare to jump?

461
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,319
Fine!

462
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:24,839
I dare!

463
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,160
Come on!

464
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,160
You didn't know how high it was.

465
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,000
Still, you stepped out.

466
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,599
You paid him with your life.

467
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,359
You've survived.

468
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,359
You owe him nothing.

469
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
[Dingqiao Post Office]

470
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:38,960
Huansheng.

471
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,240
What are you doing?

472
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,440
Do you know her?

473
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:43,799
Nope.

474
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:46,680
What are you doing here?

475
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,799
I told you.

476
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,279
To wire money to my friends.

477
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,759
There is a post office in Jianqiao.

478
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,839
Why do you come all the way here to Dingqiao?

479
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,559
You kept talking about

480
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,559
sending money to poor friends.

481
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,480
Who are they?

482
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,799
What happened to you?

483
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,000
You weren't this caring.

484
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,720
Come on.

485
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,720
Let's talk somewhere else.

486
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,200
Captain.

487
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,200
What do you want to say?

488
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,680
Huansheng.

489
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,519
I've been observing you for a long time.

490
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,960
The books you read.

491
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,960
The topics you mention.

492
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,599
Just get to the point.

493
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,799
You are a communist.

494
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,319
Captain.

495
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,960
You're not thinking straight.

496
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,119
The money you wire,

497
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,559
it's not for your friends,

498
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,599
but the Communist Party.

499
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:00,920
Am I right?

500
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:08,079
That's too severe a joke to us.

501
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,359
I'll get going if that's all.

502
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,519
Huansheng.

503
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,200
I kept looking for my home.

504
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,960
I trust you because you're Ding Huansheng.

505
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,119
And I can tell you that

506
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,880
I dropped out from Fuhua University in 1932.

507
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,759
My plan was to go to the U.S.

508
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,240
Excuse me.

509
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,240
Do you have A Young Wanderer here?

510
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,559
Sorry about that.

511
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,200
There's a reading party today.

512
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,720
They booked all the copies left.

513
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,640
A reading party?

514
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,400
Thanks.

515
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,640
My fellow students,

516
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,559
today, I'd like to share with you

517
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,480
A Young Wanderer.

518
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,799
It's a left-wing literature

519
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,079
by Jiang Guangci,

520
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
published in 1926.

521
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,000
It didn't attract much attention

522
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,480
when it first came out.

523
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,160
After months of silence,

524
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,960
it suddenly became a hit in 1927.

525
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,839
Why is that?

526
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,160
The Nationalist Revolution failed that year.

527
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,079
In 1927,

528
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,480
the KMT committed the Shanghai massacre,
wiping the communists out.

529
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,240
At that time,

530
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,880
many young people doubted

531
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,200
China's political affairs.

532
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What will China be like?

533
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,000
What about the future of the individual?

534
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,039
Left-wing literature

535
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:10,640
became a beam of light

536
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,279
in the darkness.

537
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,279
Excuse me.

538
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,240
This is the reading party of the physical society.

539
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,480
What can I help you?

540
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,680
We got a report

541
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,079
saying that this is a reading party

542
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,400
with reactionary books.

543
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,519
How is that so?

544
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,920
Take a look.

545
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,960
What is this crap?

546
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,519
The main idea is

547
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,400
the attempt to measure a electron

548
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:14,440
will knock it about
in an unpredictable way.

549
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,640
That's to say,

550
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
as the position gets more and more precise,

551
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,799
the momentum has lesser and lesser fidelity.

552
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:20,720
Stop it.

553
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's leave.

554
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,680
The Russians say that

555
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,880
words have power,

556
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,359
words are weapons.

557
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,079
The police are here.

558
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,240
Give me the books.

559
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,119
Thank you for today.

560
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You are from Fuhua University, right?

561
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,319
I'm Zhang Qi, a sophomore student majoring in Physics.

562
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,160
But I just applied to drop out

563
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,079
to go to military school in the US.

564
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,480
Why do you want to go to the US?

565
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:21,960
Back in the bookstore,

566
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
I overheard your lecture.

567
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,839
What will China be like?

568
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,279
What will my future be?

569
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,960
I'm wondering, too.

570
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,640
I wish you a safe journey.

571
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,880
I wish you can find your answer there.

572
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,279
You will.

573
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,759
Sir.

574
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,039
I took part in the left-wing activities.

575
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,079
I listened to your lectures.

576
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,880
You saved my life once in a parade.

577
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,640
Don't you remember me?

578
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,240
Of course, I do.

579
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,640
Back then,

580
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,119
I talked to you about my plan...

581
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,440
- I want to...
- Zhang Qi.

582
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,240
Now that you choose to study in the US,

583
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,000
you can stick to it

584
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,039
and see what it's like.

585
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,880
I believe that the professor

586
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,880
is a communist.

587
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,359
Months ago, I met him again.

588
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:28,799
This time,

589
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,119
I submitted an official application

590
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,200
to join the communist party.

591
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,000
He took it.

592
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:34,680
But he hasn't replied since.

593
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,640
At first,

594
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,279
I thought they wouldn't take me in.

595
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,640
And?

596
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,440
Later, I found out that

597
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,200
he was murdered.

598
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,200
I keep asking myself.

599
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,960
What is a communist like?

600
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,240
Now I realized.

601
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,599
Just like him.

602
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,920
Huansheng.

603
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:05,920
I've figured it out

604
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,039
after all these years.

605
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,599
Some anchor their hope

606
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,680
on international mediation,

607
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,279
asking for peace talks.

608
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
But the communists are different.

609
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,000
As Minister said,

610
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,680
the communists never give in.

611
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,440
I would like to follow a party

612
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,599
that never gives in,

613
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,599
a party that's devoted to the country and the people.

614
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,240
Captain.

615
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,440
I hear what you said.

616
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
I take it as words on the spur of the moment.

617
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,839
I won't tell anyone.

618
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,000
They're not!

619
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,240
After the 9.18 Incident,

620
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,640
I changed my name,

621
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,119
gave up my major to learn to fly.

622
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,920
Later, I joined the army.

623
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,799
I did these to save my country,

624
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,200
to find the right direction.

625
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:54,880
Yet they fail me time after time.

626
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,480
When I bombed Fuxing,

627
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,359
when I saw those young soldiers dead,

628
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,880
the time when I heard

629
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,799
Declaration of the CPC Central Committee
on Publishing the Cooperation

630
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,160
I understand

631
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,240
and I firmly believe

632
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,920
that only the CPC can save China.

633
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,599
Huansheng.

634
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,559
You're family to me in Jianqiao.

635
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,680
I'm tired of wandering.

636
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,000
You said you changed your name.

637
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,720
I changed mine, too.

638
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:51,000
When I was 15,

639
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,880
I escaped from my foster family

640
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,880
and became a waif.

641
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,920
I nearly got hit by a train once.

642
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:00,240
Thankfully, a bunch of people saved my life.

643
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,240
They are like stars in the night sky.

644
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,160
They taught me a lot of things,

645
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,279
brought me a new life.

646
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,279
That's why I changed my name.

647
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,599
I still remember a Mr. Luo.

648
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,799
He is a scholar.

649
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,000
I like him the most.

650
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,160
He told me

651
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,039
that it seems

652
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,599
China is drifting on the boundless dark sea,

653
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,680
losing its way,

654
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,680
looks like we're in the middle

655
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,000
of a dark and freezing night.

656
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,720
Actually,

657
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,839
it is like a ship far out at sea

658
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,119
whose mast-head can already be seen from the shore,

659
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,680
it is like the morning sun in the east

660
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,960
whose shimmering rays are visible
from a high mountain top.

661
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,079
Inspiring.

662
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,559
Is it by Mr. Luo?

663
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,759
No.

664
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,640
It's Mr. Mao.

665
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,359
I quote it from his article

666
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,640
a Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire.

667
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,000
A single spark

668
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,880
can start a prairie fire.

669
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,160
Exactly.

670
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,319
He said

671
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,519
it is like a child about to be born

672
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,640
moving restlessly in its mother's womb.

673
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
This is a brand new China.

674
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,240
A country that cleans away the stale

675
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,079
and usher in the independence of the Chinese nation.

676
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,440
We will expel Japanese imperialism

677
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:23,920
and great powers away

678
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,359
with the national-democratic revolution

679
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,160
and strive for the complete

680
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,440
national liberation and independence.

681
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,359
Those people are shining like bright stars.

682
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,920
Are they in Yan'an right now?

683
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
Right, they're in Yanan.

684
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,680
Huansheng.

685
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,920
You're a communist.

686
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,279
Right.

687
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,240
I am a communist.

688
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,720
I'm speaking to the right person.

689
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,480
Huansheng.

690
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,559
Please lead my way.

691
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,240
I want the party to lead my way.

692
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,319
Alright.

693
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:06,720
I'm glad to hear that.

694
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,039
I'm right about you.

695
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,599
I'm glad for you.

696
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,440
Uncle Luo would be happy for me, too.

697
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,639
A single spark can start a prairie fire.

698
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,400
The sparks

699
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,760
are passed on by us

700
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,239
one after another.

701
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,280
By that time,

702
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,320
the entire country will see the fire.

703
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,239
It will light up the sky.

704
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,119
Huansheng, tell me more about it.

705
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,599
I enjoy it.

706
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,199
I like to hear it from you.

707
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,199
Being a communist or not,

708
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,639
we're here for one common purpose.

709
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,280
To save the country and the people.

710
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
We must not fear death.

711
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,840
I'm telling you.

712
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,480
Your mission is to survive.

713
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,559
Lack of forbearance in small matters
upsets great plans.

714
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,239
In Shanghai's front line,

715
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,840
the Japs keep sending in troops.

716
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,960
There have been 270,000 Japs soldiers there.

717
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,280
Nine army divisions, two army brigades,

718
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,719
the third navy fleet,

719
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,599
and the fourth navy fleet,

720
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,639
and the air force,

721
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,719
our entire main force has gathered up.

722
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,679
We just get the order

723
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,679
to transfer away and maintain our strength.

724
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,400
Alright.

725
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,360
Now,

726
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,440
I'll give out the order from Chairman

727
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,719
to Central Aviation School,

728
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,960
brigades, and Hanguang Squadron.

729
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,320
From now on

730
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,800
to zero o'clock on November 11th,

731
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,400
evacuate to Nanchang, Liuzhou,
and Kunming in batches.

732
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,320
Hanguang Squadron, withdraw to Kunming.

733
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,039
For safety concerns,

734
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,800
you shall fly with lights off

735
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,840
and remain an altitude

736
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,440
of no less than 3,000 kilometers

737
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,360
while changing the altitude consecutively.

738
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,920
Freshmen of the 11th year,

739
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,239
shall evacuate to Kunming on foot.

740
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,039
Hanguang Squadron applied to

741
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,639
assist in defense of Hangzhou Bay.

742
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,679
In the current situation,

743
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,000
I will apply to suspend the mission.

744
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:23,559
That's all for the gathering today.

745
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,320
Time to prepare.

746
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,320
Minister.

747
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,920
I have a proposal.

748
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,400
Go ahead.

749
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,480
We don't have enough power

750
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,440
to defend Hangzhou Bay.

751
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,480
This is our weakest point,

752
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,800
Jinshanwei.

753
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,719
Once we lose it to the enemy,

754
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,079
Shanghai would face a backlash.

755
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,199
And the Japs

756
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,960
could easily take Nanjing and Hangzhou.

757
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,800
That's the weakness

758
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,679
of our front line in Shanghai.

759
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,840
I don't understand.

760
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,840
Why do Commander of the Third Theater of War

761
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,639
keep transferring troops

762
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,079
from Hangzhou Bay?

763
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,559
Jinshanwei is a mudflat.

764
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,760
The terrain there is too complex.

765
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:23,159
It's not an ideal landing place.

766
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,320
But during Jiajing period in the Ming dynasty,

767
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,360
Japanese pirates landed there

768
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,840
and attacked Shanghai.

769
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,480
Earlier,

770
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,199
four divisions of the Eighth Army

771
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:34,960
and a brigade stationed there.

772
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:37,559
Commander must be aware

773
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,840
of the importance of Jinshanwei.

774
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,280
But now,

775
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,719
the 62nd division is the only troop there.

776
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,159
They can't hold it.

777
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,519
Minister.

778
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,679
If Hanguang Squadron is away,

779
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,119
Hangzhou Bay will be at risk.

780
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,559
In September,

781
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,679
Central Aviation Manufacturing Plant

782
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,599
has shutdown to move inland.

783
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,880
According to the Air Defense Program

784
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,360
by Military Affairs Commission,

785
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,639
we ought to have 630 fighters by 1936.

786
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,719
But now, the program

787
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,199
is a mere scrap of paper.

788
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,239
There isn't any hope.

789
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,559
We don't have many fighters left.

790
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,239
If we don't have new fighters by November

791
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,199
to make up for the loss,

792
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,639
we'd lose all of our air combat capability.

793
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,159
Avoid the fight and maintain our strength

794
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,920
in preparation for the future.

795
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,760
It's a decision we have to do.

796
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,159
Comply with the order.

797
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,440
The day after,

798
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,880
Hanguang Squadron withdraws from Hangzhou.

799
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,679
Pack all the treasures

800
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,760
and the valuable stuff

801
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,320
and send them back to Chongqing.

802
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Director, are we...

803
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,280
Yes, sir.

804
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,079
I will send out the order.

805
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,679
Any news on Xu Village.

806
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,519
We just got the news.

807
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,320
The three families there

808
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,400
managed to get train tickets to Kunming in a week.

809
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,639
They're leaving on November 11th.

810
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
When Ling Wenyue left,

811
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,559
he'd take the oracle bone with him.

812
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,519
Keep an eye on him.

813
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,880
What about Zhang Qi?

814
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,880
He submitted a petition

815
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,280
on behalf of Hanguang Squadron

816
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,400
to help defend Hangzhou Bay.

817
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,840
With those few planes? Hopeless.

818
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,480
Excuse me!

819
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:08,880
Come in.

820
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,679
Minister.

821
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,559
Captain Zhang has been standing outside

822
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,960
for an entire day.

823
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,480
Shall we...

824
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,280
Leave him be.

825
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,000
He'll go back when he's tired.

826
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,480
Yes, sir.

827
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,360
Captain Zhang.

828
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,480
Minister asked me to get you a coat.

829
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:52,680
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

830
00:40:53,110 --> 00:41:00,130
♫ Shed tears to our sweet love ♫

831
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:08,610
♫ The date of return is yet to come ♫

832
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,780
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

833
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,610
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

834
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:23,610
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

835
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:30,860
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

836
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,660
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

837
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,810
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

838
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:56,510
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫

839
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:58,760
Zhang Qi, what do you want?

840
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,920
Hanguang Squadron

841
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,239
applies to withdraw the suspension

842
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,679
and help defend Hangzhou Bay.

843
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,599
Do you know what's the punishment

844
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,400
for disobeying military orders?

845
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:07,360
Minister.

846
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,119
We're soldiers.

847
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,119
We're not here to maintain strength,

848
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:12,679
nor to evacuate.

849
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:15,079
We shall stick to our motto.

850
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,519
We shall defend our ground

851
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,440
with our fighters, our bombs, and our bodies.

852
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,239
At worse, we'll perish with the enemy.

860
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:17,780
