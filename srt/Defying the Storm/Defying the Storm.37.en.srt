[Episode 37]

3
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,480
Mr. Meng.

4
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,879
Mr. Meng.

5
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,879
Are you okay?

6
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,640
Miss Bai.

7
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,799
Miss Bai, Haitang is still with those Japanese.

8
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,599
Don't worry.

9
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,920
This is a part of our plan.

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,400
Go to a safe place now.

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,120
Gao Lin.

12
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,000
Take Mr. Meng to Niter Cave and protect him.

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,000
Miss Bai, what about Haitang?

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,680
Don't worry.

15
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,719
We'll protect her.

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,800
Just go.

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,719
Be careful.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,759
Mr. Meng, let's go.

19
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,919
Hurry up.

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,759
Stop!

21
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,879
Okayama Shinichi.

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,560
Uncle Ling.

23
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,360
Without my endorsement,

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,919
who will believe the oracle bone inscriptions
of Wuding you have is real?

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,719
Well.

26
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,520
Zeng Mu.

27
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,080
When you were building this lab,

28
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,400
in order to escape from the Japanese,

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,759
you built a secret room, right?

30
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,960
You cunning old man.

31
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,080
The hole I dug is finally useful now.

32
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,400
I dug a hole here.

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,280
Just guess,

34
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,759
where my dark room is.

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,199
It's in this room.

36
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,120
Guess where the hole I dug is.

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,080
How could we know that?

38
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,840
It's indeed a secret room.

39
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,680
It heads directly to the underground cave.

40
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,520
Great.

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,520
Zeng Mu.

42
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,400
If so, I need to stay here.

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,280
If Haitang stays here alone,

44
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,560
I'll be worried about her.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,080
Uncle.

46
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,199
Then you'll also be in danger.

47
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,759
Girl, I know what you're thinking.

48
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,759
But there are so many people.

49
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,159
If anything happens,

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,199
our plan would fail.

51
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,759
If I stay here,

52
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,680
I can stop Okayama at least.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,159
I trust Zhang Qi.

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,120
I trust all of you.

55
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,240
But please give me a chance.

56
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,000
Please let me be a part of this plan, okay?

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,720
Mr. Ling.

58
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,800
Mr. Ling.

59
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,199
Thanks to Miss Meng,

60
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,920
X-Ray powder camera has verified

61
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,680
the cinnabar on the oracle bone

62
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,480
is a combination of cinnabar and hematite.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,560
Do you have anything to explain, Mr. Ling?

64
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,839
The spirit of mountains,

65
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,720
the virtue of ancestors,

66
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,160
a beautiful antique like this.

67
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,558
So, Mr. Ling,

68
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:22,870
you also think this is the real
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding, right?

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,360
But if you say
it's oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

70
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,800
it's hilarious.

71
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,279
Whether it's real or fake,

72
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,959
Mr. Ling,

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,319
do you think you can lie to me?

74
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,879
Whether it's real or fake,

75
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,040
I'll give you a reason.

76
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
Mr. Okayama, if you don't believe it,

77
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,439
you can shoot me.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,879
You think I don't dare to kill you?

79
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,759
Mr. Ling, you're wrong.

80
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,480
Even if I kill you now,

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,279
and press your fingerprint on the paper,

82
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
everyone will think,

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,319
the world-famous
oracle bone inscription expert has surrendered,

84
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,959
and agreed with what I said in the article.

85
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,319
What you've analyzed
for a dozen of years was all wrong.

86
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,720
As for Shang Dynasty,

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,480
it's a hoax.

88
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,160
How could you call yourself a scholar?

89
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,879
It's nonsense! You shameless man!

90
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,079
Shameless?

91
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,839
To be honest,

92
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,360
I'm not a scholar from Tokyo Imperial University.

93
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,839
Or I can just let you see my victory.

94
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,800
Then you can die.

95
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,199
Send a telegram.

96
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,959
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,680
Uncle Ling.

98
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,920
I'll read it and you send it.

99
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,360
Okay.

100
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,240
Ling Wenyue, professor of history, Fuhua University,

101
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,600
retrieved Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar
three years ago.

102
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,720
After three years,

103
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,279
he admitted that he failed to compile it,

104
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,240
and gave us the precious
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

105
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,160
which means he has given up on this study,

106
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,000
and he won't study
oracle bone inscriptions from now on.

107
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,000
Professor Ling has formally announced,

108
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,319
after studying for a dozen of years,

109
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,240
he had a conclusion,

110
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,639
Shang Dynasty has never really existed.

111
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,120
He thinks,

112
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,120
whether it's Shang Dynasty or Zhou Dynasties,

113
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,759
it's not true history.

114
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,680
2127 calling.

115
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,000
Eta 30 minutes to target location.

116
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Commence descent to 1000 meters.

117
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,319
Two degrees to the left.

118
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,279
Two degrees to the left.

119
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,720
Xiao.

120
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,959
Don't disappoint me on today's news conference.

121
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,360
No matter what you do,

122
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,160
you must stop Kang Lanshan
from releasing Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

123
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,680
Tell me.

124
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,759
What do you want me to do?

125
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,120
Kill her.

126
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,240
Mr. Ling has admitted,

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,440
China only has about two thousand years history.

128
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,759
As for Shang and Zhou Dynasties,

129
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,600
they're all legends.

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,000
Okayama.

131
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,799
With some lies and my fingerprint,

132
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,320
you think people will believe you?

133
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,840
A repeated lie can become truth.

134
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,639
Now that I've caught you,

135
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,440
I won't give you a chance
to walk out of here alive and correct it.

136
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,720
Continue.

137
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,600
Okayama.

138
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,360
If I can prove oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding
doesn't originate from Kingdom Wu Ding,

139
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,559
what will you do?

140
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,200
Wait a second.

141
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,559
Mr. Okayama.

142
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,679
Since we've got oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

143
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,519
you can kill them now.

144
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,039
Don't say too much.

145
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,559
Just do it.

146
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,120
We have something more important to do.

147
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,519
Calm down, Mr. Ando.

148
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,360
Ling Wenyue is right.

149
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,919
If he can prove it himself,

150
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,919
and we can record it and take a photo,

151
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,000
it's more persuasive than the article I wrote.

152
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,000
Besides, we are in the mountain,

153
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,159
where can they go?

154
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,440
56th Division will arrive
at Hongshi half an hour later.

155
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,960
Everything is in our control now.

156
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,440
All scholars can't do great things.

157
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
Take the troop to the side way with the main force.

158
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:36,799
Yes, sir.

159
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,559
Play it by ear.

160
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,159
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,799
Hong'en.

162
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:08,879
Qianying.

163
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,919
Help me greet them.

164
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,279
Okay.

165
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:11,799
I'll talk with him.

166
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,480
Okay, just go.

167
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,279
Hong'en.

168
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,039
Didn't you go to western Yunnan with Uncle Meng?

169
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,759
They're fine?

170
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,960
Where are my dad and Haitang?

171
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,919
I escaped from there.

172
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
Your dad is still with them.

173
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,440
But what do you mean by your dad and Haitang?

174
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,080
They went to western Yunnan to save Uncle Meng,

175
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,559
as well as Zhenzhu.

176
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,320
What? Zhenzhu also went there?

177
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,480
Why did she go there?

178
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,159
She said she has government resources.

179
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,360
She can help to save Uncle Meng if necessary.

180
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, Hong'en.

181
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,759
Before Zhenzhu left,

182
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,399
she asked me to deliver this letter to you.

183
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,600
Qianying.

184
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,720
Qianying, come here.

185
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,360
Please excuse me for a while.

186
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,480
Xiao Hong'en is unreliable.

187
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,919
We need to have a plan b.

188
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,440
Yes, sir.

189
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,039
Men have their dignity, so does newspaper,

190
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,440
and so does a nation.

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
Without these dignities,

192
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,639
men will no long exist, so will newspaper,

193
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,320
and so will a nation.

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,960
If I can die for the newspaper,

195
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,679
it would be my glory.

196
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,600
Hong'en.

197
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,039
After I went there,

198
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,399
whether I will live or die,

199
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,879
it all depends on you.

200
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,919
You're the one

201
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,840
to decide whether I'll live or die.

202
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,759
So this is what you mean.

203
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,360
The bomber checked the bomb device again.

204
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,240
Copy that.

205
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,080
Check the bomb device.

206
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,600
Ms. Kang.

207
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,600
Hong'en.

208
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,200
You work for Director Lu, right?

209
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,240
You're finally here.

210
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,879
Where is Kang Lanshan?

211
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,600
They said,

212
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,000
they would change a place to release it.

213
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,480
Bai Fei took many people to protect them.

214
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,080
I can't defeat them.

215
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,080
Fortunately,

216
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,320
you're finally here.

217
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,879
Well,

218
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
they went to the Democratic Wall.

219
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,240
Come on, let's check there.

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,320
Hurry up.

221
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:18,639
Ms. Kang.

222
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,759
I need you to act a play with me.

223
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,279
Do you trust me?

224
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,639
Yes.

225
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,519
Okay, Qianying,

226
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,559
go to Shundecheng Printing House now,

227
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,679
and ask for the extra of Xinzhi Times a month ago.

228
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,480
Extra?

229
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,320
I know.

230
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,360
Qianying, go there right now.

231
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,559
Just go.

232
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,000
Okay.

233
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,159
Ms. Kang.

234
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,440
Thank you.

235
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,360
On behalf of Professor Ling Wenyue
from the Department of History, Fuhua University,

236
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,200
I'm here to release his study,

237
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,080
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

238
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,960
In 1930,

239
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,639
Professor Jin Zhilie and Ling Wenyue
from the Department of History, Fuhua University,

240
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,039
found an oracle bone inscription in Xiaotun, Anyang.

241
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,440
Mr. Ling, tell me.

242
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,240
Record it.

243
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,200
Yes, sir.

244
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,588
Do you still remember the day
when you went to the news conference?

245
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,200
You raised a question.

246
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,679
Mr. Ling.

247
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,799
Let me ask you one more question.

248
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Why is the record of a meteor shower carved,

249
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,039
instead of inscription?

250
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,240
Why is the record of a meteor shower
on oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding carved

251
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,119
instead of inscription?

252
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,519
Your question gave me much inspiration.

253
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,200
There are three cinnabar carvings behind it.

254
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,200
Professor Ling translated it
as the record of a meteor shower.

255
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,000
The westward movement of stars.

256
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,440
In all these years,

257
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,759
we thought this is a meteor shower

258
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,119
that happened when King Wu Ding
first established his kingdom,

259
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,680
so we thought this oracle bone originated
from Shang Dynasty when King Wu Ding was in charge.

260
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:39,680
[Xinzhi Times Office]

261
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,519
Yes, Zhou.

262
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,920
I'll read it and you copy it.

263
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,160
And then send it to

264
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
The New York Times,

265
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,480
The Washington Post,

266
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,839
The Times,

267
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,319
France Soir and Pravda.

268
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,519
I rewrote
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar in three years,

269
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,359
and found many literary forms
that contain the record of a meteor shower.

270
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,759
So,

271
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:02,240
the practice of divination
that people commonly accept may not be right.

272
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,920
The rubbings in the Department of History
in Fuhua are not enough.

273
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,799
What should we do if it's not here?

274
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,599
So,

275
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,720
your mom went to Chongqing.

276
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,000
I've applied to the Nanjing Institute.

277
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,720
We'll copy all the rubbings
of oracle bones and bronze wares there.

278
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,359
I found it.

279
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,480
The conclusion is,

280
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,160
the meaning of the record of a meteor shower
is the westward movement of stars.

281
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,960
But this oracle bone inscription of Wuding
doesn't originate from Kingdom Wu Ding.

282
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,359
But the westward movement of stars,

283
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,000
wasn't a meteor shower
that happened in Kingdom Wu Ding,

284
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,000
which didn't match the idea
that Professor Ling previously believed.

285
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,720
On the contrary, it records
one of the great migrations of human civilization.

286
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,079
After the chaos in Shang Dynasty,

287
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,039
Kingdom Shang met a huge calamity.

288
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,920
There were floods and turmoils in politics.

289
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,200
People suffered a lot,

290
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,119
so Pan Geng decided to relocate the capital.

291
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,759
This was recorded in The Book of History, Pan Geng.

292
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,319
There was a huge calamity.

293
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,920
The former Emperor didn't stay in the capital.

294
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,920
He chose to move capital
for people's interest instead.

295
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,200
It means,

296
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:27,559
King Pan Geng didn't stay in the former capital.

297
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,119
For the interest of people,

298
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,279
he decided to relocate the capital.

299
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,759
In order to get out of trouble
and restore people's livelihood,

300
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,680
King Pan Geng defeated much opposition,

301
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,680
and moved the capital from Yan, Qufu of Shandong now,

302
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,319
to Yin, Xiaotun of Anyang now.

303
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,759
This great migration from east to west
is known as the westward movement of stars.

304
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,319
Because of this migration,

305
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:57,079
Shang Dynasty survived the floods,

306
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,240
and the chaos in politics,

307
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,079
which stabilized the central power,

308
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,839
and laid a solid foundation
for the prosperous of Kingdom Wu Ding.

309
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:07,480
Thus the decaying Shang Dynasty
became prosperous again.

310
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,240
On this oracle bone,

311
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,119
look at its front.

312
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,279
The writing on this oracle bone
belongs to two kingdoms.

313
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,839
One part of it originated from Kingdom Wu Ding,

314
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,960
and the other part belongs to Kingdom Pan Geng
that was a hundred years earlier.

315
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,319
In order to relocate the capital,
Pan Geng practiced divination three times.

316
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,720
The first and second times were inauspiciousness.

317
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,759
But King Pan Geng insisted
to have the third divination,

318
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,599
and the conclusion was great auspiciousness,

319
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,319
so Pan Geng decided to relocate the capital.

320
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,319
Combined with three articles
in The Book of History, Pan Geng,

321
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,200
we had a second argument,

322
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,559
to prove the relocation
of capital is a historical fact.

323
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,720
This was previously called
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

324
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,359
Also, the historians and archaeologists

325
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,799
have discovered
thousands of oracle bone inscriptions.

326
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,720
They confirmed oracle bone inscriptions

327
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,599
are the earliest mature writing system
discovered in China so far.

328
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,319
It is not only the origin of Chinese characters,

329
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,880
but also the beginning of Chinese history.

330
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,279
About the other part, in Kingdom Wu Ding,

331
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,559
King Wu Ding also
practiced divination three times.

332
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,599
He asked God,

333
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,119
whether to fight against Qiang Region
that has been harassing Shang.

334
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,880
The first and second times were inauspiciousness.

335
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,000
The third time was auspiciousness,

336
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,720
so Zi, the wife of King Wu Ding,

337
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,480
took a troop and defeated them.

338
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,680
She gained a peaceful environment for Shang.

339
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,440
This war was also recorded
in The Book of Zuo Zhuan and Records of the Historian.

340
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,240
We had a second argument,

341
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
and the conclusion is,

342
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,640
this war is a historical fact.

343
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,359
King Pan Geng was in charge for 28 years,

344
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,079
during 1398 BC to 1371 BC.

345
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,759
Then King Xiaoxin was in charge for 21 years,

346
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,880
King Xiaoyi was in charge for ten years.

347
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,839
Then it was King Wu Ding,

348
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,480
who was in charge for 59 years.

349
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,720
There are twelve Kings in Shang Dynasty.

350
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,759
The total time is 287 years.

351
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,680
Besides,

352
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,400
Pan Geng relocated capital in 1350 BC.

353
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,880
Jifa defeated the King of Shang in 1075 BC.

354
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,759
The oracle bone inscriptions can match with

355
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,759
Records of the Historian, Yinben,

356
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,599
Bamboo Annals,

357
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,880
The Book of History.

358
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,200
The antiques are mutually
confirmed with historical records.

359
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,480
This can prove that Shang Dynasty really exists.

360
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,799
Lying! You are lying!

361
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,759
You can doubt the history.

362
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Mencius once said,

363
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,480
better no book rather than trust book completely.

364
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,920
So as scholars studying history,

365
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
we should hold the attitude

366
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,079
to be loyal to history and empirical evidence,

367
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,759
to spread faith or doubt as you believe.

368
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,000
On this oracle bone,

369
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,000
it is the writing of our nation,

370
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,039
the culture of our nation,

371
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,720
and the wisdom of our ancestors.

372
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:48,359
You can't deny it with your lies!

373
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,599
Chinese writing is the only language in the world
that has never stopped developing up to now.

374
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,359
It not only records the history of China,

375
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,240
but also it is the most important
spiritual bond that makes China.

376
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,759
The words that have been passed
on from these broken books,

377
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,400
the inheritance that
hasn't been interrupted for thousands of years,

378
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,240
and the culture
that is embedded in our soil and our blood,

379
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,960
they are the reputation of our ancestors,

380
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,960
the inheritance of our nation.

381
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,559
Xinzhi Times!

382
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,000
Extra! Extra!

383
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,519
Extra!

384
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,039
Have a look!

385
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,079
Come and have a look!

386
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,000
Panlong Society of Japan
wanted to falsify the beginning of Chinese history.

387
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,960
Their conspiracy has exposed.

388
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,119
Please have a look.

389
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,519
Please have a look.

390
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,119
In 1920,

391
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,799
Okayama Shinichi from Panlong Society of Japan
stole oracle bones from Yin Dynasty ruins.

392
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,039
From 1929 to 1941,

393
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,880
he smuggled many antiques in Anyang out of China.

394
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,279
In 1939,

395
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,279
the Japanese wanted to steal Simuwu Cauldron,

396
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,599
but they failed.

397
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,039
From 1942 to 1943,

398
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,519
Japanese troops stationed in Henan

399
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:00,599
took advantage of local bandits

400
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,559
to rob many cultural relics from Yin Dynasty ruins.

401
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,880
Then they transported the relics to Japan
through the port of Dalian Far East Refinery.

402
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,319
Whether it's oracle bone inscriptions
of Wuding or Pan Geng,

403
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,559
now I have it.

404
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,599
As for you,

405
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,480
I won't let you walk out of here alive.

406
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,759
Send a telegram.

407
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,440
Yes, sir.

408
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,680
Based on previous messages,

409
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,359
Comrade Xu Zhice will lead the enemies to the lab

410
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,240
before 4 o'clock this afternoon.

411
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,559
Luckily, Zhenzhu made a plan.

412
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,559
And when we were in Kunming,

413
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,960
she has told me the time and schedule.

414
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,799
Before we left Fuhua University,

415
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,119
I've had a deal with Ms. Kang.

416
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,559
When Mr. Ling meets Okayama today,

417
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,400
they will release Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar
at an appropriate time.

418
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,240
They can't release it too early.

419
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,799
Or we will be in danger.

420
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,359
And they can't release it too late.

421
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,319
If they release it after Okayama's article,

422
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,559
all our previous efforts will be wasted.

423
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,839
So, Ms. Kang will release it
at 6 o'clock on the date of 21st.

424
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,599
Haitang told Lanshan and me this plan.

425
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,240
It's like besieging Wei to rescue Zhao.

426
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
So now,

427
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,359
I'll calm down,

428
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,559
and play this empty city tactic with you.

429
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,160
The so-called Chinese civilization
is the accumulation of falsity.

430
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,759
China is a rootless duckweed.

431
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,039
Historians represented by Ling Wenyue,

432
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,640
denied their studies totally.

433
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:52,920
It also proved,

434
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,480
even the best scholars of China
have lost faith in its history.

435
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,160
It is willing to cede China's political,

436
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,799
cultural and economic
management rights to Japan, which is superior.

437
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,680
There is no truth in the world!

438
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,960
There are only power and weakness.

439
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,599
I own the right of speech.

440
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,400
The words I said repeatedly are the truth!

441
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,519
History,

442
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,039
is written by the powerful people.

443
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,279
Post this article now!

444
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,480
Where is the beginning of Chinese history?

445
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,759
Oracle bone inscriptions are

446
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:54,400
the earliest mature writing system
discovered in China so far.

447
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,440
It is not only the origin of Chinese characters,

448
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,680
but also the beginning of Chinese civilization.

449
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,640
Okay, Zhou, that's it.

450
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,839
Post it now.

451
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,039
Zhou, wait a second.

452
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,599
He is upstairs!

453
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,319
Hello, Zhou.

454
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,480
There is one more message, post it together.

455
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,400
Just copy it.

456
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,240
Panlong Society of Japan
bought oil fields in Jing'an secretly,

457
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,559
and they asked Lu Ziyi from Kuomintang,

458
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,960
Political Discipline Department,

459
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,359
Air Force Officer School,

460
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,440
Central Aviation Council to manage it.

461
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,000
They made a huge profit
by supplying inferior fuel to our domestic wars.

462
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,359
It not only greatly
damaged our military capabilities,

463
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,599
but also directly led to dozens
of aircraft accidents, including the 428 air battle.

464
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,200
A virtuous man needs to think of nine things,

465
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,519
to be insightful, to listen carefully,

466
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:32,240
to be gentle, to be polite,

467
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,759
to be faithful, to be steady,

468
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,400
to be thoughtful, to be calm,

469
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,240
and to be righteous.

470
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,279
Hong'en, well done.

471
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,680
Do you know what it means?

472
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,119
It means,

473
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,880
we need to be reasonable,

474
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,440
and introspect ourselves from time to time.

475
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,079
People will make mistakes,

476
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,440
but they can't just let it be.

477
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,599
So, uncle,

478
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,759
if I made a mistake and correct it,

479
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,880
I'm still a good person, right?

480
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,240
What do you think?

481
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,799
This is not the man I know.

482
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,039
This is not Xiao Hong'en.

483
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,519
You asked me if I loved you.

484
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,640
Yes.

485
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,160
But I love the Xiao Hong'en that always tells me

486
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,839
to be patriotic,

487
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,680
to never surrender,

488
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,799
to never be insulted.

489
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:06,839
I'm coming.

490
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm coming.

491
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,079
Come on.

492
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,119
Sir.

493
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,240
What?

494
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,559
It's six o'clock, come on.

495
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,839
B-25.

496
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,559
It's B-25.

497
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,680
Where is it?

498
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,799
Combat aircraft of Wujiaba is here.

499
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,480
I can only hear it.

500
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,359
Wujiaba wants to kill all enemies here.

501
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,559
The B-25 is a medium bomber.

502
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,920
The maximum payload is 1361 kilograms.

503
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,559
If it drops bombs here,

504
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,480
the lab and cave will all be destroyed.

505
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,480
No one can escape.

506
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,319
What can we do now?

507
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,400
We need to stop it.

508
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,960
But we don't have communication equipments.

509
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,640
How can we...

510
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,000
That's it?

511
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,880
The B-25 has a disadvantage.

512
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,359
It takes a long way to get into the attack line.

513
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,119
Sir, refuel Xishan immediately.

514
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,880
Can you make it fly?

515
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,160
Of course it can.

516
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,240
Come on.

517
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,640
Nianqiao, what happened?

518
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,680
The Captain gave me a signal.

519
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,079
We need to stop the bomber from dropping bombs.

520
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,319
2127 calling.

521
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,519
2127 approaching target location.

522
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,599
Control tower, control tower.

523
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,039
Radio is out of order.

524
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,119
There is strong magnetic interference nearby.

525
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,279
Descend to 500 meters.

526
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,200
Copy that.

527
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,880
Descend to 500 meters.

528
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,079
Xishan requesting liftoff.

529
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,880
It can fly for about fifteen minutes.

530
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,480
Go ahead.

531
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,519
Go ahead.

532
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,480
Be careful.

533
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,319
Sir.

534
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,839
We just got an important message.

535
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,519
What important message?

536
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,240
Nothing is more important than releasing
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding to the world!

537
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,119
Mr. Okayama.

538
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,319
It's five past six now.

539
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,359
We must gather with the main force
at Hongshi Road before seven o'clock.

540
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,839
Just deal with the mess here.

541
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,200
I'll read the telegram to you.

542
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,559
Haitang, Mr. Ling.

543
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,839
Because it takes some time to get the fuel,

544
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:39,920
I'll refuel the aircraft at about six o'clock.

545
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,640
At ten past six,

546
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:42,920
I'll drive the plane,

547
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,839
and warn with a hovering roar,

548
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,839
to attract the indoor enemies' attention.

549
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,079
The enemies will
be distracted for about two minutes.

550
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:51,680
In two minutes,

551
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,480
Donglai, Zhenzhu,

552
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,480
try to let the indoor enemies go outside.

553
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Then I'll fly away and drop bombs at a proper time.

554
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,000
Mr. Zeng.

555
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,720
Find the certain place to hide.

556
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,799
Nianqiao, take Mr. Meng to the safe place we arranged.

557
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,679
Haitang, Mr. Ling.

558
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,119
Go to the underground cave immediately,

559
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,440
remember?

560
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,559
So you all know the safe places for you to hide.

561
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,039
Please repeat it to me.

562
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,239
Wait.

563
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,559
I have a question.

564
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:27,199
Mr. Ling and Haitang won't face Sima Yi.

565
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,840
They are going to face the lunatic Okayama Shinichi,

566
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,719
and the well-trained flying squad
of Japanese 56th Division.

567
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,719
You said you'll drop bombs according to time.

568
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,119
How do you know Mr. Ling and Haitang

569
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,119
have entered the underground cave or the safe place?

570
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,559
If they are still outside,

571
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,039
instead of entering the safe place,

572
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,079
will you still drop the bombs?

573
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,039
Well, I think,
the interests of the whole are more important.

574
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,360
It wouldn't be a pity if I die.

575
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,039
Uncle Ling is right.

576
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,840
Zhang Qi.

577
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,199
Drop the bombs according to time.

578
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,119
At six o'clock this afternoon,

579
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,840
BBC released a piece of news.

580
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,159
Fuhua University announced to the world,

581
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,559
Ling Wenyue's book,

582
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,960
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar,

583
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,039
tells the beginning of Chinese history.

584
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,679
Impossible.

585
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,599
This is fake news.

586
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,760
Impossible!

587
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,400
This must be fake news!

588
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
This is fake news.

589
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:46,800
Fake news.

590
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,880
This is fake news.

591
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,480
It's here, hide.

592
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,159
2127 will enter attack line.

593
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,559
Two minutes left.

594
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,559
The bomber gets ready to drop the bombs.

595
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,320
I'm ready to drop the bombs.

596
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,159
One degree to the left.

597
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,719
The B-25 bomber is heading here.

598
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,039
B-25, Doolittle Raid.

599
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,519
We were ambushed.

600
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,440
Break out of here!

601
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,639
Break out of here!

602
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,960
Come on, Uncle Ling.

603
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,119
Come on.

604
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,320
I'll do it.

605
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,440
The oracle bone of Wuding.

606
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,159
I'll get it, you can go down first.

607
00:36:59,159 --> 00:36:59,960
Wait, Haitang.

608
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,280
It's not important.

609
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,760
Humans can pass on the culture, not an oracle bone.

610
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,159
Come on, let's go.

611
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,679
There is a sniper, don't come closer.

612
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:25,840
Fire!

613
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,360
One degree to the left, keep the height.

614
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,079
Good condition for dropping bombs.

615
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,519
Countdown 60 seconds.

616
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,920
Gao Lin, Gao Lin.

617
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:06,719
Gao Lin.

618
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,119
Gao Lin.

619
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:14,599
Gao Lin.

620
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,360
Don't come here!

621
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,400
Don't come here.

622
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,440
There is a sniper on the mountain.

623
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Give me the lighter.

624
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,559
Uncle Meng, don't go.

625
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,480
You can't go.

626
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:36,880
Uncle Meng.

627
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,039
Don't go.

628
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:43,800
Uncle Meng.

629
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,760
Be careful.

630
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,000
Cunning Chinese.

631
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,119
Bomb bay is open, ready to drop bombs.

632
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,480
Waiting for order.

633
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,360
Bomber...

634
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,239
As pilots,

635
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:37,559
you should always
keep an eye out for any useful information.

636
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,599
Fire,

637
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,079
flicker,

638
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,360
smoke,

639
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,199
these could all be signals,

640
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,480
and could be important messages
someone is trying to convey to us.

641
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,519
It's easy to press the button to drop bombs.

642
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,480
But,

643
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,679
there are fathers and mothers,

644
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,559
brothers and sisters,

645
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,199
elders, women and children down there.

646
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:03,119
There's a stop signal, stop dropping bombs.

647
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,480
2127 calling control tower.

648
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,400
There is a triangle beacon signal.

649
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,800
It's an agreed signal of Hanguang Squadron,

650
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,559
which means to stop dropping bombs.

651
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,960
Please withdraw the order of dropping bombs.

652
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,800
Control tower, control tower.

653
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,639
If we can't contact Wujiaba,

654
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,280
we need to drop bombs as the order.

655
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
Bomber, ready to drop bombs.

656
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,280
Wait.

657
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,880
I heard the sound of Xishan.

658
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:04,960
Captain.

659
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,159
It's Captain.

660
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,400
