[Episode 15]

3
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,780
Oh, no.

4
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,460
I can't walk.

5
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,620
Leave now.

6
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,260
No, I'll carry you back.

7
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,280
Oh, no.

8
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,020
The range of  the pistol isn't enough.

9
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,100
Let's lure them to come instead of shooting them

10
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,740
so that they would think we have no bullet now.

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,620
Okay.

12
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,060
Second elder brother!

13
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,140
Stay here.

14
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,100
Wait a second.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,420
Let them enter our range.

16
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,420
Go ahead.

17
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,180
Closer.

18
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,700
Much more closer.

19
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,300
Here.

20
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,020
Let's leave here now!

21
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,580
Bro.

22
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,580
Both of my legs are broken.

23
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,900
I can't walk.

24
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,260
Leave now.

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,500
We've made a lot of noise.

26
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,620
Hurry.

27
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,460
No.

28
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,020
I must take you away.

29
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,540
Zhang Qi.

30
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,340
It's the command that you must leave now.

31
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,500
There's only one bullet left.

32
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,580
Be at ease.

33
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,140
I won't let them arrest me.

34
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,260
Zhang Qi, I have a question.

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,900
Do you stay true to the mission of entering our party?

36
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,580
Huansheng.

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,940
Yes, I do.

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,020
Fine.

39
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,860
Our party needs you.

40
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,940
We need you to fight.

41
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,460
New comrades will be assigned to contact you.

42
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,620
You'll be tested until our party accepts you.

43
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,820
The first cipher is

44
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,580
tell my family I'm safe when you go back.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,980
The second is that

46
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,460
I'm willing to join the army to fight for glory.

47
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,860
Do you remember?

48
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,580
Tell my family I'm safe when you go back.

49
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,940
I'm willing to join the army to fight for glory.

50
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,100
Yes.

51
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,780
Wait... I...

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,700
I represent our party and give you the first task.

53
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,900
Leave here at once

54
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,980
and you must live on.

55
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,140
You have to complete it.

56
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,180
I've told you I won't leave.

57
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,380
Though you're the one who tests me,

58
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,100
anyhow, I'm your captain!

59
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,380
I can't leave you alone!

60
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,740
Die together

61
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,860
or one of us can survive.

62
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,540
Make up your mind.

63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,460
I refuse!

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,860
I will take you away.

65
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,180
If you're still here,

66
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,020
I'll kill myself at once.

67
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,140
Second elder brother!

68
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,620
Remember the old ways?

69
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,460
We're both soldiers.

70
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,660
Bet is bet.

71
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,900
Fine. Go ahead.

72
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,380
What if I win?

73
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,460
What if I lose?

74
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,140
The one who wins can get the bullet.

75
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,580
Deal.

76
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,380
Your choice?

77
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,300
I choose the side with the words on it.

78
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,500
And you choose the side with the sun on it.

79
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,220
The side with the words is always.

80
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,620
You win every turn.

81
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,300
I don't think you can get that luck this time.

82
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,780
Fine.

83
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,180
I'll bet with you!

84
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,580
Second brother.

85
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,020
Zhang Qi.

86
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,580
Take this coin.

87
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,500
Do you know that?

88
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,100
As soon as you started to call me that,

89
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,300
I've treated you as my real brother.

90
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,300
If I really have one,

91
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,860
I'm sure he will be like you.

92

93

Nothing.

What else can we eat?

117
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,820
Let's find some when we arrive at the next town.

118
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:29,940
Hang in.

119
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,340
Doctor!

120
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,540
Hurry up!

121
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:36,940
What's up?

122
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,900
He's shot.

123
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,540
Quite serious.

124
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,620
Send to the operating room!

125
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,180
Go!

126
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,820
The bullet's shot into his left metathorax
with an angle of 45 degrees.

127
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,140
Not through.

128
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,420
The bullet is inside his anocelia.

129
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,420
Location is unknown.

130
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,580
Because of the oronasal hemorrhage,

131
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,580
my initial diagnosis is that his lobe is hurt.

132
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,580
Over 800 milliliters of blood
made him a hemopneumothorax.

133
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,020
The fifth rib on the left, the sixth rib on the right

134
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,540
and his right radius are broken.

135
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,900
As he's suffered from shock,

136
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,700
we must perform right now.

137
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,580
Yes.

138
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,180
What's inside his hand?

139
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,180
[Pengcheng Hall]

140
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,660
Fine. Move on.

141
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,260
Minister.

142
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,300
The operation has been performed for two hours.

143
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,940
It seems he's in a bad condition.

144
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,860
Fortunately, our land force conquered this river bank.

145
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,740
Then they found him and gave him some treatments.

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,620
Lieutenant Li arranged a transport plane

147
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,780
to send him and the other wounded soldiers to Anyi.

148
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,900
Otherwise...

149
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,740
Minister, what about others?

150
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,780
What about other members of Hanguang?

151
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,380
According to the current news,

152
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,820
the rest six men except him...

153
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,500
were all sacrificed.

154
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,780
I'll lead troops and fly to Kunming.

155
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,860
The Aviation Council has arranged
other doctors to assist the surgery.

156
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,420
Stay here and accompany him all the way.

157
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,460
Report to me if something happens.

158
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,060
Did you hear me?

159
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,300
Yes.

160
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:14,620
Doctor.

161
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,340
How is he?

162
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,060
Now, his blood pressure, oxygen content of blood
and pulse tend to be normal.

163
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,700
Does it mean he's fine?

164
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,660
Well, if it was a perforating injury, it would be fine.

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,740
The bullet quite close to his heart is a huge trouble.

166
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,460
It's nearly impossible to take it out.

167
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,020
He might fail to survive the operation.

168
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,300
Doctor, can he survive?

169
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,820
Be at ease.

170
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,340
He's not in danger at the moment.

171
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,020
Anyhow, it's like a time bomb in his left lung.

172
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,460
He'll be at death's door at any time.

173
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,140
Even though he could recover quite well,

174
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,060
his normal life would still be heavily influenced.

175
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,500
A lot of sequelae,

176
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,060
like dyspnea,

177
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,780
heart failure, high fever,

178
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,660
sharp pain all over his body and so on.

179
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,220
He might have such a life forever.

180
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,180
Because of the drastic change of air pressure,

181
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,740
the lungs of a pilot may face more pressures
than normal people.

182
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,220
If he could recover very well,

183
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,780
it only can be said that

184
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,060
he won't be like a patient.

185
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,740
Anyhow, the huge change of air pressure while flying

186
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,940
may cause the bullet to burst his aorta

187
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,860
or hurt his heart.

188
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,140
It's really his good luck to survive.

189
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,580
Second brother.

190
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,820
Second brother.

191
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,180
I'm safe...

192
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,180
Captain.

193
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,140
I'm here, captain.

194
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,300
Tell my family I'm safe when you go back.

195
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,260
I'm safe...

196
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,740
I'm willing to join the army to fight for glory.

197
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,340
Everything is fine.

198
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,060
Give me some.

199
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,580
I want one bowl.

200
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,780
One, please.

201
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,860
Give me one.

202
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,100
Give me some.

203
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,780
Please give me some.

204
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,940
Nothing here. No congee left.

205
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,860
You can leave. Nothing left.

206
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,700
Where are your boxes?

207
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,300
They're over there.

208
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,660
Where are the boxes?

209
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,660
I put them there.

210
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,740
Oh, come on!

211
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,300
You threw your cases there to fight for some congee?

212
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,740
Don't you know an occupation called "thief"?

213
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,180
Haitang... My money...

214
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,900
Mom, I'm hungry...

215
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,980
They're all in the cases.

216
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,340
I want congee.

217
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,980
Let me see.

218
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,940
Not bad. Mine is still here.

219
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,700
It's fine, Yuanyin.

220
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,580
My dad gave them to me...

221
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,300
Come here.

222
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,220
Congee is here. Come on.

223
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,860
Why do you get another bowl?

224
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,300
I begged it.

225
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,100
Have it.

226
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,340
Hungry, mom. I want congee.

227
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,540
I see. We'll have some later.

228
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,060
There are some here. Here you are.

229
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,180
Thank you so much.

230
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,700
Aren't you hungry?

231
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,260
She has a kid.

232
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,660
Are you from the heavens?

233
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,660
Come over here.

234
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,420
Sit there.

235
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,620
Sit down.

236
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,740
Sit here.

237
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,220
Don't move.

238
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,460
Here you are.

239
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,300
I'm watching you.

240
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,620
How dare you give it to others again?

241
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,660
Have it.

242
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,100
Thank you,

243
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,660
It's the best congee that I've ever had.

244
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,220
Meng Haitang.

245
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,740
Move your toes.

246
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,580
What's the matter?

247
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,180
They're broken.

248
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,180
Are you going to walk to Kunming
by such a pair of leather shoes?

249
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,940
Tell me.

250
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,660
How many blisters there?

251
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,980
Yuanyin still knows to wear cloth shoes.

252
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,980
I thought we would go by train.

253
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,020
They're my only shoes.

254
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,980
I came with you in a hurry.

255
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,060
I took no other shoes.

256
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Doctor.

257
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,740
How is he?

258
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,820
Not bad.

259
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,820
I just got a message

260
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,780
that Dr. Chen and I were asked to
go back to Chongqing at once.

261
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,420
We all need to leave here in two hours.

262
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,780
Aviation Council will drive you to Kunming.

263
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,100
I'll give him more anti-infection medicines.

264
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:50,860
Ask the driver to drive stably.

265
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,460
I see. Thank you, doctor.

266
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,380
Captain.

267
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,700
Though Huansheng sacrificed himself,

268
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,420
he sent you back.

269
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,980
I'll protect you in the future.

270
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,260
From now on,

271
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,140
our lives are bound to each other.

272
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,420
Are you fine?

273
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,020
Half yuan, two pairs.

274
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,940
Good for walking.

275
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,220
Sir, give me two pairs.

276
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,940
Okay.

277
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,060
We're almost there.

278
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,260
Right in front of us.

279
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,580
Hang in there.

280
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,500
Pretty nice.

281
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,340
Thank you.

282
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,420
Straw sandals.

283
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
Straw sandals.

284
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,620
Good to walk.

285
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,700
Half yuan, two pairs.

286
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,500
Straw sandals.

287
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,540
Excuse me, sir.

288
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,740
Is Wushi there?

289
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,620
Yes. Turn around there.

290
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,060
You'll be there within two miles.

291
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,140
Thank you so much.

292
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,260
Yuanyin?

293
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,860
Yuanyin? Are you alright?

294
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,060
- Yuanyin!
- Yuanyin!

295
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,580
- Bring her there.
- Okay.

296
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,580
Be careful.

297
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,860
Take care.

298
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,260
Yuanyin!

299
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,340
Why are her hands so cold?

300
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,220
Catching a cold?

301
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,340
Was she ill before?

302
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,540
Let me see.

303
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,500
What are you doing?

304
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,100
Yuanyin.

305
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,740
Yuanyin.

306
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,940
What should we do now?

307
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,940
She'll feel better if she leans on it.

308
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,540
Wait! What's that?

309
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,740
What do you want?

310
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,260
Yuanyin.

311
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,260
Hold her up.

312
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,940
Be cautious.

313
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,300
How are you?

314
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,940
She wakes up.

315
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,940
Drink more.

316
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,420
Sugar inside it.

317
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,220
You'll feel better after drinking it.

318
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,140
Thank you.

319
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,820
Take your time.

320
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,700
Thank you, sir.

321
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:44,060
Could you please let her drink some?

322
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
- Haitang!
- Thank you.

323
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,860
How do you feel? Are you fine?

324
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,460
Thanks.

325
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,220
Can he?

326
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,020
Thank you.

327
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,580
Here you are, Donglai.

328
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,620
Thank you.

329
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,140
How should we call you?

330
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,620
My surname is Fu. I'm a teacher.

331
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,740
You can call me "Mr. Fu".

332
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,460
It seems that...

333
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,620
you haven't eaten for some days.

334
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,020
Come with me.

335
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,380
Let's go.

336
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,220
- This way.
- Okay.

337
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,980
Don't make noise.

338
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,140
They're having an exam.

339
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,340
Have a seat.

340
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,780
I asked them to have a test

341
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,060
and told them it wouldn't be over
until I came back with all shoes out before dusk.

342
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,860
After the exam is over.

343
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,220
I'll make you some food.

344
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,460
Where are you from?

345
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,620
And where to go?

346
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,660
We're from Hangzhou.

347
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,020
We've walked for 20 days.

348
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,140
To Kunming.

349
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,580
Thank you.

350
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,540
You walked to Wushi over 20 days.

351
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,140
Without enough foods.

352
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,820
You walked pretty fast.

353
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,220
We got a lift on the way.

354
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,260
Oh, I see.

355
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,220
It's still a hard thing.

356
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,860
What about you, Mr. Fu?

357
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,540
We're from Shouchang middle school.

358
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,500
We've been out for over a month.

359
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,420
We met bombs on the way.

360
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,620
Only me and several orphan children left.

361
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,820
We'll seek refuge with my friends in Kunming.

362
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,020
Middle school?

363
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,940
I find there's a young kid.

364
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,900
You mean Bu?

365
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,700
I found him on the way.

366
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,500
He would die if I left him there.

367
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,660
Mr. Fu.

368
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,700
Come and see.

369
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,260
Look at him!

370
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,060
Left hand.

371
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,100
Hurry up!

372
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,820
Stay there!

373
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,580
Do not cheat again!

374
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,260
Do as you can.

375
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,780
Go back to the exam. You still have an hour.

376
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,780
After the exam, write "Gongshu" down
three times from memory.

377
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,780
Yes.

378
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,300
Thank you, sir.

379
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,540
Go to accompany them.

380
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,100
Go ahead.

381
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,260
Mr. Fu.

382
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,220
As you're the headmaster,

383
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,140
why do you weave straw sandals?

384
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,300
Someone stole my money.

385
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,140
My money is stolen.

386
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,380
You also met a thief?

387
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,740
Thieves are hateful!

388
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,460
Without money,

389
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,540
kids have a hard life.

390
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,180
I have nothing else to sell

391
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,700
so I could only use my skills.

392
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,980
I'm from Jiangxi.

393
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,620
I used to weave straw sandals to support my family.

394
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:42,500
I thought many refugees don't know

395
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,860
straw sandals are better
than cloth or leather shoes when walking.

396
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,260
So I decide to make money by it.

397
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,540
If so, I have something to sell.

398
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,020
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

399
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,580
- Donglai!
- Stay here!

400
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,580
Li Donglai, you...

401
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,580
Dear sir.

402
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,060
I have a treasure.

403
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,660
Can I exchange it for three sweet potatoes?

404
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,260
Do you know what it is?

405
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,580
The emperor wrote on it thousand years ago.

406
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,460
It's worth of the whole Wushi Town.

407
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,740
Give me some sweet potatoes and then you can have it.

408
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,220
All you guys come out!

409
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,180
Come out right now!

410
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,500
Is it a thief nest?

411
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,980
What are you doing?

412
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Stay in the room.

413
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,980
Haitang. Yuanyin. Watch them out.

414
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
Hurry up!

415
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,300
Mr. Fu.

416
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,820
Donglai.

417
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,500
What's going on?

418
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,420
Sir, what did he do?

419
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,540
You look honest.

420
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:41,940
How can you a teacher have such a student who steals?

421
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,940
The swindler said he's your student.

422
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,660
What did you steal?

423
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,620
I stole nothing!

424
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:48,460
I only smelt the sweet potato peel!

425
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,380
I didn't steal it!

426
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,100
Still reluctant to admit?

427
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,580
Sir, please don't!

428
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,140
He looks like a thief.

429
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,460
He tried to cheat out money by a trifle

430
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,620
and said it's worthy of the town.

431
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,300
There are wars outside

432
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,900
and it's hard for us to live on.

433
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,140
That bastard tried to cheat and steal us!

434
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,620
I'll give you a lesson on behalf of your teacher!

435
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,540
What are you doing?

436
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,780
Don't act recklessly!

437
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,940
How could you let him off?

438
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,820
Mr. Fu.

439
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,860
I only have two yuan. It's earned by selling shoes.

440
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,100
Mr. Fu.

441
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,980
How dare you cheat me that he has money?

442
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,060
Catch them!

443
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,060
Hold on!

444
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,900
Don't be so rude!

445
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,020
- Don't!
- I have!

446
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,220
Put down your pistol first.

447
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,660
Haitang!

448
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,940
I have.

449
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,540
He didn't cheat you.

450
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,980
How can we live without these money?

451
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,380
Shut up, Li Donglai!

452
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,180
You'll die if we don't give them!

453
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,060
That's not enough.

454
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,980
He's so bad.

455
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,100
I must give him a lesson.

456
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,660
You've got the money.

457
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:29,900
What else do you want?

458
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,140
I want to beat him three times.

459
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,460
I'm his teacher.

460
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,420
I'll replace him.

461
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,460
Mr. Fu!

462
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,740
Mr. Fu, rice is here.

463
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,460
Fine.

464
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,260
Mr. Fu.

465
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,180
Are you fine?

466
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,900
Yes.

467
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,300
Youngster, what's your name?

468
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,740
Li Donglai.

469
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,100
It's all my fault today.

470
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
I'm sorry.

471
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,020
Never mind, Donglai.

472
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,300
Fetch a bucket of water.

473
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,420
Okay.

474
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,180
Sir.

475
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,380
Do you forget that

476
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,340
the man you saved cheated our money last time?

477
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,260
Don't worry. It's a misunderstanding.

478
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,020
We have some guests today.

479
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,900
Go to get some salt.

480
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,860
Come on.

481
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:40,340
Gongshu Pan made scaling ladders for Chu.

482
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,820
After he succeeds, Chu will use it to attack Song.

483
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,020
Mr. Mozi met the king and said

484
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:49,420
there's a man who abandons his luxuriant carriage.

485
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,220
He ignores his luxurious carriage
to steal his neighbor's broken one.

486
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,820
He ignores his decent clothes
to steal his neighbor's coarse one.

487
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,660
He abandons his delicious foods
to steal his neighbor's poor dishes.

488
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,780
What kind of person is he?

489
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,540
The king said

490
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,020
that guy must sink in stealing.

491
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,540
Sir. the water is boiling.

492
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,140
Shall we put the rice inside it?

493
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,300
Okay.

494
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,900
Here you are.

495
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,420
Time to eat.

496
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,620
Have more please.

497
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,380
The congee tastes salty!

498
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,820
- It's tasty!
- Thank you, Mr. Fu.

499
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,420
I won't stop until I'm totally full!

500
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,940
Take your time.

501
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,980
Donglai.

502
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,700
Have you read before?

503
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,380
I can read but only a little.

504
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
My family was so poor that
they sold my elder brother.

505
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,740
So how can I have that chance?

506
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,580
Do you know what she said?

507
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,180
Of course I do.

508
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,780
How smart I am!

509
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,340
To find a man to create ladders!

510
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,820
Is that right?

511
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,900
Donglai, you're wrong.

512
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,300
Donglai.

513
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,860
Let me tell you something.

514
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,260
You can hear while eating.

515
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,580
Just like listening to a story, okay?

516
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,220
Yes! I love stories!

517
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,460
Well, you can tell stories?

518
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,420
Of course I can.

519
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,940
I could not only tell stories

520
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,300
but also act in an opera.

521
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,220
Really?

522
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,980
Yes.

523
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:25,940
When the war is over,

524
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,500
I'll show you

525
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,900
and bring you a part of "Farewell My Love".

526
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,900
Okay!

527
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,020
Come on, Bu.

528
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,260
Have more.

529
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,340
No hurry.

530
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,980
Take your time.

531
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,060
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

532
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,580
Mr. Fu...

533
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,580
I'm not hungry.

534
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,420
How can you eat his food?

535
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,580
You're not a kid!

536
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,100
How can you have so much?

537
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,660
He hasn't had any food for two days!

538
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,900
He wakes up every night because of stomachache!

539
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,820
Huang Shixing.

540
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,380
I'm a man. It's hard for me to feel hungry.

541
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,740
So it's fine. Sit down.

542
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,620
Right now.

543
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,900
You're growing. You need to have more.

544
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,100
I see.

545
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,740
Donglai.

546
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,980
Listen carefully while eating.

547
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,740
What's the matter, sir?

548
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,340
Where's my ring?

549
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,900
Ring?

550
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,740
Your ring is missing?

551
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,020
Ring? Where is it?

552
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,860
His ring is missing. Let's help him!

553
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,820
Sir, I didn't find it in the room.

554
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,140
Fine. I see.

555
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:21,980
Let me have a look.

556
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,220
Have you found it?

557
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,500
How can I lose it?

558
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,740
Fine carefully. Maybe it falls in a gap.

559
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,460
Our teacher has clean hands.

560
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,700
He gives everything to the school and students.

561
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,860
We can't pay for the tuition.

562
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,540
He almost gave his life to the donors

563
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,340
to raise funds for the school.

564
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,140
His wife concerns him a lot

565
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:02,740
so she sold all her things
to help him establish the school.

566
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,580
Now the school no longer exists.

567
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,820
We lost all the teachers.

568
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,980
And even his wife passed away on the way.

569
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,540
The gold ring is the only memento left to him.

570
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,220
If you took it away,

571
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,980
you'd better give it back yourself.

572
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,300
What are you talking, you bastard?

573
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,980
I'll beat you up!

574
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,980
How can you talk to him in this way?

575
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:29,860
I find it!

576
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,540
This one?

577
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,780
Why is it in the bucket?

578
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,420
That's it.

579
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:38,700
Nice.

580
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,300
It's not missing.

581
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,580
It's found!

582
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,580
Thank you.

583
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,540
What did you say?

584
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,540
I stole it?

585
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,500
We've found it.

586
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,580
Calm down.

587
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,620
Donglai, I trust you won't do harm to good people.

588
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,860
Because they saved us.

589
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,180
I won't fuss about it.

590
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,100
It's fine.

591
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,860
Still think of it?

592
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,620
Kids have gone to sleep.

593
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,100
I want to make more straw sandals

594
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,780
to earn some money tomorrow.

595
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:20,140
Make some money for the journey.

596
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,660
Let's help you.

597
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,860
More people, more power.

598
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,260
Okay.

599
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,660
You can have a try.

600
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,140
Okay.

601
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,340
One straw isn't solid.

602
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,060
But when you twist three together,

603
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,380
they become a solid rope.

604
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,220
Like this.

605
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,700
That's right.

606
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,140
Just like braiding your hair.

607
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,020
Braid them.

608
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,460
You can't have a long trip by leather shoes.

609
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,300
Though they're well-fitting,

610
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,940
you'll still have blisters and wounds.

611
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,180
Cloth shoes are not good enough.

612
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,980
Well, straw sandals can help you walk better.

613
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,900
You still can wear them
with thick socks in cold weather.

614
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,780
They can protect your toes and keep you out of cold.

615
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,980
The quality of local straw sandals are poor.

616
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,380
You can't get a sweet potato by selling ten pairs.

617
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,100
But ours are strong.

618
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,940
We can buy one by selling seven pairs.

619
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,060
Your hands are pretty dexterous.

620
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,860
You can support yourself by your skills.

621
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,900
Of course.

622
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,580
My mom always says I'm gifted.

623
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,700
Mr. Fu.

624
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,260
You owe me a story.

625
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,900
Story...

626
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,260
I'll tell you when we're alone next time.

627
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,340
Not for others.

628
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,940
Okay.

629
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,660
Haitang.

630
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,220
I want to give you something.
