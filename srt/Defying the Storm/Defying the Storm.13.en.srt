[Defying the Storm]

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,799
Minister,

4
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,359
we are soldiers,

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,610
what we should do is not to retain our strength,

6
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,879
nor to escape,

7
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,439
but to follow the motto of Central Aviation School.

8
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,000
Our bodies,

9
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,840
planes and bombs

10
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,519
should perish with enemy's fleets and positions.

11
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,359
Zhang Qi, you are too lawless.

12
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,599
What time is it now?

13
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,480
You're still talking about national politics in vain,

14
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,100
and denigrating the layer of the peak.

15
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,359
It's a tactical retreat,

16
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,439
not an escape.

17
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,439
Minister,

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
there are 600,000 people in Hangzhou alone.

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,120
What will they do if we run away?

20
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,439
Do you think I don't feel bad

21
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,639
when I tell you to retreat?

22
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,960
As a soldier,

23
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,400
I've done nothing all these years.

24
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,960
Pingjin, North China, and Nanyuan Airport,

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the land of Jiangnan where I was born and raised.

26
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,599
Watching Japanese blow them up like this,

27
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,400
could my heart not be bleeding?

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,039
The other day, the Japanese Foreign Minister

29
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,800
proposed seven reconciliation treaties.

30
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,439
Our Chairman said

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
not to agree to any of them.

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,080
Once we agree,

33
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,319
the world will be in chaos,

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,080
and the Communists will swoop in.

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,680
The Communist Party will never surrender.

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,199
Even they know not to surrender

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
but to fight,

38
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,280
what about us?

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,639
As soldiers, we elites can't go in nor go back,

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,719
but only maintain stability and seek peace.

41
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,919
Don't I feel ashamed in my heart?

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,560
Then let Hanguang Squadron stay and fight.

43
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,360
Fight.

44
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,479
Fight what?

45
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,199
You're just going to die.

46
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,560
Do you think if you die,

47
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,159
Shanghai will be saved?

48
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,879
Will Hangzhou Bay be saved?

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,599
Stay alive,

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,080
you'll get your chance.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,360
Minister.

52
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
Go to Kunming tomorrow morning.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,879
If you dare to say one more word,

54
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,240
I will shoot you now.

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,439
Minister,

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
then shoot us all together.

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,039
Hanguang Squadron collectively request

58
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,420
to assist in the defense of Hangzhou Bay.

59
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,360
Request to assist in the defense of Hangzhou Bay.

60
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,080
Tang,

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,479
Captain Zhang has really led a good team,

62
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,319
who are loyal to the country.

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,510
As Political Discipline Department's Deputy Director,

64
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,199
I am very moved.

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,599
In my opinion,

66
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,520
Hanguang Squadron should go to fight with the enemy,

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,879
so as to demonstrate the morale

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
and prestige of Chinese soldiers.

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,159
Lu Ziyi,

70
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,850
whether Hanguang Squadron goes to fight or not,

71
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,120
I think it's none of your business.

72
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,719
I think you're overreaching.

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,879
I've already called our chief.

74
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,240
He appreciated Captain Zhang very much,

75
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,910
and said that Political Discipline Department

76
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,240
would report Captain Zhang's bravery

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,680
to the Aviation Council.

78
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,280
What a good thing.

79
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,080
Jin Shan Wei.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,839
What time is the train to Chongqing at night?

81
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,959
10 o'clock.

82
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:30,839
Sir,

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,120
just got the news that

84
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,720
three divisions of the Japanese Tenth Army,

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,639
about 30,000 people,

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,830
took advantage of the heavy fog

87
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,510
to land at the north bank of Hangzhou Bay,

88
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,360
Quan Gong Ting, Jin Shan Wei, and Cao Jing Town

89
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,560
at the same time.

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,639
Where's the garrison?

91
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,399
Two companies of soldiers were dead.

92
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,279
Hangzhou Bay been occupied.

93
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,360
Hangzhou Bay been occupied.

94
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,120
The mission you wanted is gone.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,399
We've lost Hangzhou Bay,

96
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,319
but we still have Jiangyin.

97
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,199
I propose to

98
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,120
assign Hankuang Squadron to defend Jiangyin.

99
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,199
Lu Ziyi,

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,759
what do you mean?

101
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,240
Don't worry,

102
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,879
please listen to me carefully.

103
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,040
Since Hangzhou Bay has been occupied,

104
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,319
then their next target will be Nanjing.

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,439
Zhang Qi, Captain Zhang,

106
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,360
is a hero in air combat.

107
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,879
Hanguang Squadron is good at air defense.

108
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,800
At this time of national crisis,

109
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,439
we should defend the capital

110
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,800
to show the spirit of our aviation school.

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,839
Minister,

112
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,680
this time, I agree with Deputy Director Lu.

113
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,600
At present, Nanjing is defenseless.

114
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,199
Our main ships in Jiangyin have all been sunk.

115
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,300
Now there are only a few forts such as Huangshan Fort,

116
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,120
Xishan Fort,

117
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,319
and Wushan Fort to fight with the enemy.

118
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,279
If the forts are lost,

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,279
Jiangyin will be defenseless.

120
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,839
Hanguang Squadron requests to fight,

121
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,990
requests to assist in the defense of Jiangyin Fort.

122
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,560
Hanguang Squadron requests to

123
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,199
assist in the defense of Jiangyin Fort.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,720
Okay.

125
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,560
Since that,

126
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,920
Hanguang Squadron, listen to the order.

127
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,240
Zhang Qi,

128
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,480
divide Hanguang Squadron into two parts,

129
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,199
and take out two fighters

130
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
to escort the aviation school

131
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,240
to Kunming via Nanchang.

132
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,839
You lead seven fighters

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
to support the defense of Jiangyin Navy,

134
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,560
and bombard the landing enemy,

135
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,800
especially against enemy's aircraft carriers,

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,360
sink them at all costs.

137
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,480
But regardless of success or failure,

138
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,360
you must evacuate

139
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,839
before 12:00 on November 26th,

140
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,720
to join us at Nanchang.

141
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,600
Yes.

142
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,319
Don't dare to expect success,

143
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,279
but I have the determination.

144
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,600
First,

145
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,199
we don't have the exact location of the enemy ships.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,680
Second,

147
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,800
our fighters drop bombs in parallel,

148
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,839
so we can't inflict a fatal blow on the enemy.

149
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,240
Captain, Huansheng,

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
why are we going to Kunming?

151
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,600
Captain,

152
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,040
I'm also a fighter of Hanguang Squadron.

153
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,439
Let Huansheng go to Kunming,

154
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,480
I stay to fight.

155
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,100
I'm not going to Kunming either.

156
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,199
I'll stay and fight.

157
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,360
It was decided by lot.

158
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,439
I drew it myself.

159
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,920
Are you not convinced?

160
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,040
You need to be the captain,

161
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,279
then it's up to you.

162
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,600
Draw lots.

163
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,680
Draw what?

164
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,360
I'm not here, who did you draw with?

165
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,720
Besides,

166
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,639
why should I be the one to stay?

167
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,399
No way.

168
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,199
Nianqiao,

169
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,160
Captain and I made the decision.

170
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,959
You take Chen Ran and the others away.

171
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,799
No.

172
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,080
To defend Jiangyin for the navy is to die.

173
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,440
This can't be settled.

174
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,720
Draw lots, right?

175
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,559
Okay, I'll draw again.

176
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,279
Why are you so agitated?

177
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,519
Instructor.

178
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,600
Instructor.

179
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,320
We'll stay, too.

180
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,440
Yes, we're not going to Kunming.

181
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,279
Sir,

182
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,840
I can fly now.

183
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,650
I can shoot full rings in the air every time.

184
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
I apply to join the battle

185
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,519
to defend Nanjing and Hangzhou.

186
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,960
Yes, we can fly too.

187
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,440
We apply to join the battle.

188
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,279
All of you, stand at attention.

189
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,990
You guys just enlisted in August,

190
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,400
what qualifies you to apply to join the battle?

191
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,879
Let me ask you,

192
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,679
can you pull up 9,000 feet fast?

193
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,440
Can you make a forced landing

194
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,559
in heavy rain and fog?

195
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,840
More importantly,

196
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,519
have you ever killed anyone?

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,380
Dare you look into the eyes of the enemy

198
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,159
and pull the trigger?

199
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,679
No.

200
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,519
But we'll do it.

201
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,320
We will do it.

202
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,780
We leave seven fighters of Hanguang Squadron

203
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,639
to fight with the enemy

204
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,080
to let Jianqiao have the future generation to pass on.

205
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,679
So you must evacuate safely to Kunming.

206
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,840
Can you do it?

207
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,120
Answer me, can you do it?

208
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,799
We can do it.

209
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
It's too low.

210
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,679
I can't hear you.

211
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,000
We can do it!

212
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,600
Captain,

213
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,000
I request to redraw with Vice Ding.

214
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,080
Zeng Nianqiao,

215
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,799
and Ding Huansheng stay.

216
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,919
Others are dismissed immediately.

217
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,080
Captain.

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I told you.

219
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,639
Dismiss immediately!

220
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,720
Captain, you've been up for two days.

221
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,200
Get some sleep.

222
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,960
I'll talk to Nianqiao.

223
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,639
What's wrong with you today?

224
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,000
Why are you so stubborn?

225
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,720
Captain, I…

226
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,639
I have a letter.

227
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,799
If I can't come back,

228
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,159
give it to Haitang for me.

229
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,879
Why don't you give it to her yourself?

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
[For Miss Haitang]

231
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,279
Here are two more clothes.

232
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,840
Here.

233
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,279
I tell you that

234
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,159
the rent of the three families next door

235
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,759
is due to the end of the year.

236
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,440
Now it's chaotic,

237
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,759
and we're leaving suddenly,

238
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,759
so give them back the money.

239
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,039
If they want to leave, we won't lose anything.

240
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,600
If they want to stay,

241
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,080
we don't want the rent either.

242
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,000
Just consider them as our housekeeper.

243
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,519
Okay, don't worry.

244
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,559
I'll ask our daughter

245
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,320
to deliver this money to them.

246
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,080
Dad, Mom,

247
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,440
I have to go out.

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
This is for Haitang.

249
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,320
Yuanyin.

250
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,799
I thought your mom told you that

251
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,919
tomorrow we'll go home to Lishui,

252
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,080
where our people will take care of each other.

253
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,919
It's not safe here.

254
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,480
Don't run around.

255
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,519
Have you packed all your luggage?

256
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,039
Yes.

257
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,399
Why are you still leaving?

258
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,120
What's in your hands?

259
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,360
This is my copy of novel,

260
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,200
Goethe's.

261
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,720
I heard that some time ago

262
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,200
someone flew a plane to Xu Village to look for you.

263
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,080
He is the son of Professor Zeng,

264
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,679
called Zeng Poshan.

265
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,080
Mom.

266
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,639
I thought about it,

267
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,720
and I had to tell your father.

268
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm asking you,

269
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,360
are you in love with that pilot?

270
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,960
Did you take what I said for nonsense?

271
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,320
Dad,

272
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,840
he's nice.

273
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,159
I'm sure you'll like him.

274
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,320
Nonsense!

275
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,559
Calm down.

276
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,600
Yuanyin,

277
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,519
I know your heart is with that pilot now.

278
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,799
But there's chaos out there.

279
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,720
There's a big war going on.

280
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,279
The gun is going to

281
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,120
hit the bridge over the Qiantang River.

282
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,559
We people should run as far as we can.

283
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,799
But he's a pilot,

284
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,679
he's a soldier,

285
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,919
he can't run,

286
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
he has to fight.

287
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,399
What about fight?

288
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,120
In the end, he will die.

289
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,039
Yuanyin,

290
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,039
how can you stand this?

291
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,519
How can you…

292
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,879
How can you be a widow?

293
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,000
What are you talking about?

294
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,639
My words may be harsh.

295
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,200
But,

296
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,279
when you understand,

297
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,120
you'll thank me.

298
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:12,879
Fine,

299
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,240
cut the crap.

300
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,320
Tomorrow let's go back home to Lishui.

301
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,360
Hurry to say goodbye to him.

302
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,000
Isn't this manuscript for Haitang?

303
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,639
Hurry up.

304
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,559
Then return the money to them.

305
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,679
Go now.

306
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,240
President Zhou

307
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,159
has sent several telegrams from the United States,

308
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,960
urging me to take our teachers and students

309
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,720
to the southwest inland.

310
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,799
Governor Bai of Yunnan

311
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,480
has agreed to accept our Fuhua University,

312
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,359
and has given us more than 100 acres of land

313
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,160
to build a campus.

314
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,039
Yunnan is a good place,

315
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,480
which is sparsely populated and far from the front line.

316
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,720
And the Governor Bai is very sophisticated.

317
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,599
He began to hoard a lot of food

318
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,839
and supplies before the war for preparation.

319
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,759
So there will be no worries for us.

320
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,940
It is said that Bai Fei attaches great importance

321
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,079
to opening up the people's wisdom.

322
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,950
He had set up some high schools in Yunnan,

323
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,480
Zhaotong, Qujing, and Mengzi,

324
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,490
attracting a large number of funds into Yunnan

325
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,680
on the grounds of running school.

326
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,160
As long as he can really

327
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,039
help us build the school,

328
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,079
it's not a bad thing.

329
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,920
I think he must want to promote

330
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,720
the development of education in Yunnan

331
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,079
by taking our Fuhua settlement

332
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,240
in Kunming as the reason.

333
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,759
That's a good thing.

334
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,240
Professor Ling, Professor Kang,

335
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,480
I heard that

336
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Linjiang University invited you

337
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,599
to officially join them to Jiande.

338
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,960
What do you think about this?

339
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:16,039
It took Hongen a lot of effort

340
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,039
to buy the tickets for our family to Kunming.

341
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,640
Ling said that

342
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,240
we should stay with Fuhua,

343
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,920
and share the same fate with it.

344
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,680
Of course, we'll go to Kunming together.

345
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,000
I know that

346
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,119
you two wouldn't leave us behind.

347
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:36,920
Come on,

348
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,559
let me toast you with tea.

349
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,559
Unexpectedly, after staying in Hangzhou

350
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,759
for less than three months,

351
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:48,880
we will leave again.

352
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,839
I'm afraid that

353
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,519
we'll have to get used to

354
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,920
this turbulent life in the future.

355
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,799
It's just that Qianying and you

356
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,039
are going to suffer with me.

357
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,359
What are you talking about?

358
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,480
I have nothing to suffer.

359
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,780
Just think of it as traveling a thousand miles

360
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,840
and reading a thousand books.

361
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,039
Right.

362
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,279
The Japanese said that

363
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,780
they would destroy China in three months.

364
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,680
But now three months have passed,

365
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,160
and we are still standing on China.

366
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,279
It's okay this time.

367
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,160
Let's see as we travel,

368
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,279
to show the people

369
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,319
how big and beautiful our country is.

370
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,720
It can also be regarded as our life experience.

371
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,200
Just think of it as a study tour with our students.

372
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,279
Yes.

373
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,039
By the way,

374
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,839
after what happened at Beiji Pavilion,

375
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,240
are you still being watched?

376
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,519
It seems that

377
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,559
there are no strange people

378
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,680
following me recently.

379
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,079
Your son-in-law-to-be

380
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,599
seems to be my protector.

381
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,680
Zhang Qi?

382
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,279
Yes.

383
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,759
Zhang Qi is very brave.

384
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,880
Luckily he came in time that day.

385
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,480
I think he really cares about Haitang.

386
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,400
Yes.

387
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,960
Zhang Qi is really a good boy,

388
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:05,839
there is no doubt.

389
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,200
Let's leave him and Haitang alone.

390
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,240
By the way, there's one more thing.

391
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,880
About the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

392
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,440
I advise you, Wenyue,

393
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,799
don't try to carry it on your own

394
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,440
like Professor Jin.

395
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,720
You can't carry it.

396
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,880
If you need anything to share,

397
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,240
just come to me.

398
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,160
Meng,

399
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,799
there are too many things of Fuhua University.

400
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,559
Just go about your business.

401
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,700
About oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

402
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,759
I have an agreement with Professor Jin that

403
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,079
I will keep it for him.

404
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,599
When I can't carry it anymore,

405
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,319
I'll bother you.

406
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,720
Okay,

407
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,079
it's a deal.

408
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,319
Leaving tomorrow?

409
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
So can't you come to Haiyu's class?

410
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,319
Someone got tickets for my dad.

411
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,519
Please tell Zhou Chaojun and the others

412
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,920
that I'm sorry.

413
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,319
Will I see you again?

414
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,119
I don't know.

415
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,920
This is the rent

416
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,559
my mother asked me to refund you.

417
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,200
If you leave,

418
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,000
then lock up the house.

419
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,160
By the way,

420
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
what are your plans?

421
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,839
My dad has been negotiating with Yunnan recently.

422
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,359
I heard from him that

423
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,839
it didn't seem to go well at first.

424
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,390
But then I don't know why

425
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,710
the conversation got smoother.

426
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:38,650
It seems like

427
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,840
someone is helping us negotiate.

428
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,880
Now they've agreed to

429
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,359
give a piece of barren land

430
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,920
next to Kunming's Luofeng Mountain to Fuhua.

431
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,610
My cousin also went to get tickets

432
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,559
from Nanchang to Kunming on the 10th.

433
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,799
Is your cousin going too?

434
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
How about Miss Long?

435
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,799
She's from Yunnan,

436
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,750
she's already there.

437
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
Then what about Captain Zhang and the others?

438
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,920
He's always elusive in a war.

439
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,079
Sometimes when the war is over,

440
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,960
he suddenly appears.

441
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,240
I heard that

442
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,039
Jianqiao would also be moved to Kunming.

443
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,279
If that's true,

444
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,640
I hope to see him in Kunming.

445
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,519
Nianqiao and Poshan will also go there.

446
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,400
When the war is over,

447
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,279
can you come to Kunming to visit us?

448
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,640
It's okay,

449
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,599
let Poshan fight in the war.

450
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,960
I'd better try to forget about him

451
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,319
as soon as possible.

452
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,480
Please give him the rest of the manuscripts for me.

453
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,240
Yuanyin,

454
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,440
Poshan asked me to give this to you.

455
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,640
He said it was taken from his chest button.

456
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,319
When you wear it,

457
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,319
you can hear his heartbeat.

458
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,440
His heartbeat?

459
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,640
He said his heart belongs to you.

460
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,079
Tomorrow morning at 6:00 a.m.,

461
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,680
Xu's family will go to the train station.

462
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,119
Where is the ticket delivery man?

463
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,920
This train is about to arrive,

464
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,119
we must catch it today.

465
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,160
The later we leave, the harder it will be for us.

466
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,319
By the way,

467
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,680
I heard that Japanese planes

468
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,079
focused on bombing trains and railways.

469
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,079
God bless.

470
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,119
Bless us all in peace.

471
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:30,920
Okay.

472
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:31,880
How about this?

473
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,799
I'll go to look for the ticket delivery man.

474
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,279
You keep an eye on the luggage.

475
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,440
Don't walk around.

476
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,039
No hurry.

477
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Okay.

478
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,079
[Entrance]

479
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:55,720
Yuanyin.

480
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,440
Yuanyin.

481
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,680
Yuanyin.

482
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,720
Poshan.

483
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,680
Yuanyin,

484
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,839
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

485
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,240
When you go to Lishui,

486
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
take care of yourself.

487
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,640
If there's a war in Lishui,

488
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,200
you can go inland,

489
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,319
to Chongqing,

490
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,480
or Kunming.

491
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,079
Kunming.

492
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,480
Will you wait for me in Kunming?

493
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,000
I will go to Kunming

494
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,650
to continue learning combat techniques,

495
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,000
and get ready to fly at any time.

496
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,599
But I'll keep your handwritten book

497
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,680
with me all the time.

498
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,000
Yuanyin,

499
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,559
I like you.

500
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,880
But I have to let you go now.

501
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:27,079
Jianqiao has lost more than half of its pilots.

502
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,279
Every day the bereaved would burn paper planes.

503
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,759
I can't harm you.

504
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,920
I hope you survive

505
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,960
and go to a safe place with your family.

506
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,680
Zeng Poshan,

507
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,559
I have something to ask you.

508
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,119
Will you,

509
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,160
will you forget me in the future?

510
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,880
Never.

511
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,160
But you must forget me.

512
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,960
I've promised my life to this country,

513
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,640
so I can't promise it to you anymore.

514
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,000
But,

515
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,480
but I can't forget you anymore.

516
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,200
What if I can't forget you?

517
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,079
You can do it.

518
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,950
If you can't do it in one year, then do it in two years.

519
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,410
If you can't do it in two years, then do it in three years.

520
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,880
One day you'll find out it's just an impulse

521
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,319
when we are young.

522
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,119
In a year or two,

523
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,119
what I look like

524
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,960
will be a blur in your memory.

525
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:05,839
It'll all pass.

526
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,559
Fool.

527
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,960
Your eyes, your nose,

528
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,440
and your cheeks,

529
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,759
I can never forget them.

530
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,960
Zeng Poshan,

531
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:41,880
you promised your life to the country.

532
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,519
Then let me pledge my life to you.

533
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,359
Everyone will die.

534
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,079
Life or death, it's predestined.

535
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,759
I want to link my life with yours.

536
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,559
Go.

537
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,559
Dad,

538
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,319
mom.

539
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,500
Please grant me this wish.

540
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:28,030
Please let me live and die with this man, Zeng Poshan.

541
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,400
I love him.

542
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,599
I love that

543
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,799
he has me in his heart and eyes.

544
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,160
I love that he is dedicated to our country.

545
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,800
I love that he is determined to reach for the sky.

546
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,160
It's my destiny to meet him.

547
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,839
It's my fate to fall in love with him.

548
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,359
Even if he dies for the country,

549
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,799
at least,

550
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,319
I will have a happy time with him.

551
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,880
It's just that

552
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,079
I am not filial.

553
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,839
I won't be able to serve you in the future.

554
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,119
Today,

555
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:29,200
I can't go away with you anymore.

556
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,799
I just hope that

557
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,440
you can return home safely,

558
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,640
and take care of each other with our clan.

559
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,519
Yuanyin.

560
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:44,799
Mom.

561
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,440
Do you know that since we part today,

562
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:52,279
maybe you will never see me?

563
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,880
I know.

564
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,400
I am not filial.

565
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,160
Mom, forgive me.

566
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,000
Zeng Poshan,

567
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,079
that was all my daughter said.

568
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,640
I want to hear your plans from you.

569
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,799
Uncle Xu, Aunt Xu,

570
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
as a man and a soldier,

571
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,980
I should be brave enough to take up responsibility.

572
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,240
Yuanyin said these words before me,

573
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,160
I felt ashamed.

574
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,359
But what she just said

575
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,600
was exactly what I wanted to say.

576
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,400
Now that she's said it,

577
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,279
I have nothing to hesitate.

578
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,160
I love her.

579
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,960
I love her from the first moment

580
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,720
I saw her in the bookstore.

581
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,920
I will spend my whole life taking care of her.

582
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,160
It's my duty to sacrifice my life for our country.

583
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,000
But if I live one more day,

584
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,440
I'll spend one more day making her happy.

585
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,559
If I live one more year,

586
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,200
I'll use one more year to bring her happiness.

587
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,039
Please don't worry,

588
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,440
leave Yuanyin to me.

589
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,799
Are you talking from your heart?

590
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,279
Yes.

591
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,240
Get up.

592
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,920
Hurry up.

593
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,319
It's righteous for a great man

594
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,319
to commit himself to the country.

595
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,559
I also read some books,

596
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,519
so I'm not very obsessed with living.

597
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
It's just that

598
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,780
my little girl has grown up.

599
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,510
She has been growing so quickly.

600
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,679
Go.

601
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:11,800
Yuanyin.

602
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,679
Mom.

603
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,440
Yuanyin,

604
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,599
I don't have much money with me.

605
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,639
Take these few hundred dollars.

606
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,039
I'm useless.

607
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,280
I didn't buy you dowry.

608
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,039
Let's go.

609
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,000
Zen Poshan,

610
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,840
remember,

611
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,400
don't let my daughter suffer.

612
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,679
You must take good care of her for me.

613
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,639
I will.

614
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,320
Let's go.

615
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,280
Dad.

616
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,280
Mom.

617
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,199
Mom.

618
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:03,960
Dad.

619
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:09,840
Dad.

620
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,760
Mom.

621
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm unfilial.

622
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,920
Worry about advancing and retreating.

623
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,480
But when to be happy?

624
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,760
He must say

625
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,480
worry ahead of people,

626
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,440
and enjoy after people.

627
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,350
You've recited it very well.

628
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:57,639
By the way,

629
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,400
take this book home with you,

630
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,880
and keep it with you.

631
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:02,800
When you have time,

632
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,610
take it out and read it.

633
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,800
Thank you. Madam.

634
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,599
We will officially close our Haiyu school from tomorrow.

635
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,320
Study hard at home.

636
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:11,719
Go back.

637
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,840
Goodbye, Madam.

638
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:28,840
Haitang.

639
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,199
Yuanyin,

640
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,400
Poshan,

641
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,480
why are you back?

642
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,199
I sent her back to see my father.

643
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,119
Are you together?

644
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,599
Yuanyin,

645
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,679
why are you back?

646
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,440
I'll call my master.

647
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:46,800
Master.

648
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,360
Poshan.

649
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,400
My master is not in the room.

650
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:01,960
He's really not here.

651
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,679
Dad, Uncle Zeng is gone.

652
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,679
Huansheng.

653
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,079
What are you doing?

654
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:36,719
Nothing.

655
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:50,840
Huansheng,

656
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,880
can we still play basketball together?

657
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,280
I should be left to fight to death.

658
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,079
Huansheng,

659
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
I order you to take Chen Ran and the others to Kunming,

660
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,440
and keep the successors safe.

661
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,840
There will be no time

662
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,280
to get instructions for this battle.

663
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,559
In terms of combat power,

664
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,599
I have more combat experience than you.

665
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,519
In terms of cooperation,

666
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,200
I have a better understanding with the captain.

667
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,199
So it must be me who stays.

668
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
If you stay,

669
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:25,920
not only you,

670
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,039
even the captain will be in danger.

671
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,400
But for the sake of fairness,

672
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,079
old rules.

673
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,519
Okay.

674
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,559
I choose the side with words on it.

675
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,679
You choose the side with the sun on it.

676
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:46,840
Okay.

677
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,960
In Hanguang Squadron,

678
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,960
I'm your vice-captain.

679
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,400
We're both soldiers,

680
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,639
just follow the rules of soldiers.

681
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,239
Comrade Chunjun.

682
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,280
Comrade Longyuan.

683
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,199
In my heart,

684
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,719
I hope you can live.

685
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,079
It's harder to live and fight than to die.

686
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,880
You told me that

687
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,079
our mission is to test and win over

688
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,920
all the united forces of Central Aviation School

689
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,159
to persevere in the war.

690
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,000
Save the country by aviation,

691
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,980
nurture eagles through the nest.

692
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,039
Comrade Chunjun,

693
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,039
I believe you will ignite a spark

694
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,239
that can start a prairie fire.

695
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,800
So beautiful.

696
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,079
This book is for Qianying.

697
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,639
Uncle Zeng gave it to you.

698
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,039
Far away from home,

699
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:05,880
I only have the quilt to cover.

700
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,639
Thank you for the warmness,

701
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,880
leave the money to extend my gratitude.

702
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,559
This is the money your uncle Zeng

703
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,960
gave your family for the quilt.

704
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,079
Take it back to your parents.

705
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:23,280
Zeng wasted the ticket bought with great difficulty.

706
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,320
My father is so unsociable,

707
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,519
and causes much trouble for everyone.

708
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,880
Your father always has his own idea.

709
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,580
Before, he wanted

710
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,199
to walk from Beiping to Hangzhou by himself,

711
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:34,920
but I stopped him.

712
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,239
It seems that

713
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,599
we can only meet him in Kunming.

714
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,519
Uncle Meng,

715
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:46,599
can I ask two favors of you?

716
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,960
Just say it.

717
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,480
The first one is that

718
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,360
Yuanyin has decided to become a member of my family,

719
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,159
can you give my father's ticket to her?

720
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,400
No problem.

721
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,280
Thank you, uncle Meng.

722
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,920
The second thing is

723
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,679
please help me take Yuanyin to Kunming.

724
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,760
What about you?

725
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,760
Our aviation school is moving there.

726
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,559
I'll see you when we get to Kunming.

727
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,719
Don't worry.

728
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:16,960
Poshan,

729
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,719
when are you going to Kunming?

730
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:28,540
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

731
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:36,440

00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:07,370
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

737
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:14,620
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

738
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:22,420
