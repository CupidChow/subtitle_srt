[Episode 25]

3
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,920
Zhang Qi, eat with us later.

4
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,028
No need, auntie.

5
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:55,028
I have to go see my mom in a little while.

6
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,457
Go ahead.

7
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,885
Don't tire yourself out.

8
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,828
Haitang's father will do it later.

9
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,800
Mom, should I put these chestnuts in the pot?

10
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:14,080
Wait.

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,057
Let the chops stew a little longer.

12
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:19,828
It'd be too moist to eat if you put them in now.

13
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:22,240
I never made chops soup with chestnuts.

14
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,971
But ways of making stew are the same in the world.

15
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,228
I learned this stew from Ms. Kang.

16
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,028
You Cantonese all like soup, right?

17
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,971
Sometimes, I wonder

18
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,028
what soup your mom would make
for you if she's still alive.

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,650
I want you to drink the soup
that your mom used to make.

20
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,428
Get that red dates for me.

21
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,542
My family is from Beiping.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
We moved to Guangzhou because of our business.

23
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,800
So, my mom didn't make the soup very well.

24
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,828
What I've drunk most is your soup since I was a kid.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,470
You're adorable.

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,028
Your parents raised you well.

27
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,457
Please teach Donglai when you get a chance.

28
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,910
I wish he could be half as sensible as you.

29
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,885
Don't worry.

30
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,314
I've been asking Haitang
to teach Donglai to read lately.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,085
Mom.

32
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,714
I have to go on a mission in the next few days.

33
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,400
It probably takes one or two months before I'm back.

34
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,428
Just ask Donglai to find Haitang
and Nianqiao if anything comes up.

35
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,914
They'll help you.

36
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,571
You can put them in now.

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,828
The soup will be thick
when the chestnuts become soft.

38
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,600
Let me.

39
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,742
Mom, anyway,

40
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,628
just remember:

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,885
everyone of Hanguang Squadron is your son.

42
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,400
Whatever happens,

43
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:16,742
you can count on us.

44
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,657
You guys,

45
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,200
why do we still talk about Red Mansions

46
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:39,140
when the world is at war?

47
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,971
Because in our country,

48
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:44,457
cities can be destroyed,

49
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,571
but the culture can't be lost.

50
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
We can die,

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,228
but our spirits can't be dead.

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
Life is like a dream.

53
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,057
So is the Red Mansions.

54
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,514
May the flame of the Chinese culture
light up this endless night.

55
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:05,542
Light you and me up to meet everything head-on.

56
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm afraid Donglai wouldn't
get in next year with his literacy.

57
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,942
Then the year after that.

58

[The bylaws of National Fuhua University]

59
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,742
Donglai is very clever.

60
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,000
If he puts his mind to study
and he has a good teacher,

61
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:28,800
he'll get in.

62
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,140
Where is the good teacher?

63
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,430
I'd like to ask Haitang to teach Donglai.

64
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,885
It's okay.

65
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,600
Nice.

66
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,485
Good.

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,510
One more.

68
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,400
Feng Yuan.

69
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,360
Look, that boy has your bearing.

70
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,830
Take it. Watch. Stop him.

71
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
It's good to be alive.

72
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,430
Let's have a good fight with them

73
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:31,257
after your surgery is done.

74
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't worry.

75
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,085
I'm the top center of our Aviation School.

76
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,857
Let's have a match when I get better.

77
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,171
We still have to take back
the designation of Hanguang.

78
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,457
Okay. It's a deal.

79
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,314
By the way,

80
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,142
do you know the procedure
and the risk of the surgery?

81
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,600
Yes.

82
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,857
The doctor told me he didn't perform
this surgery but only observed it.

83
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,371
The success rate is under ten percent.

84
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,257
I'm worrying about something.

85
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,885
The oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

86
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,457
You can give it to me.

87
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,720
Mr. Jin told me to deliver this task.

88
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm obliged to protect it.

89
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,114
But, does Haitang know
you're going to have the surgery?

90
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,560
I want the operation because of her.

91
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,228
If it works,

92
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,371
she'll have an able-bodied lover.

93
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,971
If it fails,

94
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,857
she's still young,

95
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:57,485
she should have an easier life.

96
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,485
Zhang Qi,

97
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,800
do you think that's great?

98
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,771
Haitang.

99
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,571
Haitang.

100
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,040
Haitang, I...

101
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,342
Haitang.

102
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,571
Let me.

103
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:33,080
No need.

104
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,685
I'll do it.

105
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,428
Let me.

106
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
No need.

107
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
I'll do it.

108
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,270
Don't you know how badly you were injured?

109
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,171
The doctor told you not to lift.

110
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:03,942
Why can't you care about yourself?

111
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,971
I'm here with you.

112
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,400
I'll do all the dirty and rough work.

113
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,114
Don't fight me for that.

114
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,485
Understand?

115
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,514
If you're not with me,

116
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:26,514
What should I do?

117
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,630
We made a bet in Hangzhou.

118
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,400
I'll take care of this tree until it blooms.

119
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,910
You lost the bet.

120
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,228
I won't lose to you.

121
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,771
It'll bloom next spring.

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,771
Will you come to see it with me?

123
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,342
Yes.

124
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:45,085
Will you come to see it with me every spring?

125
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,457
Are you angry?

126
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,542
Haitang.

127
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,542
It's all my fault.

128
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,885
I shouldn't have kept it a secret.

129
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,714
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,828
Why does it hurt again?

131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,257
I told you not to lift. Why don't you listen to me?

132
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:35,542
The pain stops if you stop being angry with me.

133
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,870
Haitang.

134
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,114
Don't do the dirty job alone.

135
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,914
I'm worried about you.

136
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,314
Look, you look exhausted the last few days.

137
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,742
Did you not sleep well?

138
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,228
Don't drink Mr. Ling's tea when you work for him.

139
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,828
He likes strong tea.

140
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:00,400
You couldn't sleep well every time you drank it.

141
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,085
If you do feel bad for me,

142
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,485
you'd have told me about the operation.

143
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,571
You were badly wounded.
Why don't you take care of your health?

144
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
Haitang,

145
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,342
being a pilot means to be around death all the time.

146
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,228
I'm too selfish.

147
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,057
I shouldn't give you love

148
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,542
while make you face my death all the time.

149
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,457
I know,

150
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,571
as long as the war is still on,
you can never fully be mine.

151
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,057
But I'm not afraid of death.

152
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,457
I just want to cherish every day that I'm with you.

153
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,428
Besides, I'm not blaming you for not trusting me.

154
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,600
I just felt you didn't let me share it with you.

155
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,628
Share what?

156
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,142
Share your death,

157
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,371
your duty,

158
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,885
and the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding
that you're protecting.

159
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,485
No way.

160
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,542
The Japanese, the smugglers,

161
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,171
maybe other forces all want it.

162
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,457
I can't put a target on your back.

163
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,885
What about me?

164
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,571
Did you ever think what will happen to me if you die?

165
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,857
I just want you to survive.

166
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,085
Zhang Qi.

167
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,571
I'll be with you if you have to die.

168
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,171
Just like Yuanyin.

169
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
The oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

170
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,028
Don't say something like death again.

171
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:21,885
I just want you to keep on living.

172
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,800
As long as you're safe,

173
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,114
I won't be afraid of death.

174
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,771
I'll hide it for you later.

175
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,171
Nianqiao will help you when I'm not with you.

176
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Haitang.

177
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,428
I know.

178
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,057
Know what?

179
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,857
I know your heart.

180
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,485
You not only help me but also take responsibility.

181
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,828
If...

182
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,342
I mean, if...

183
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,142
I die in the surgery,

184
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:09,540
you must protect the oracle bone
inscriptions of Wuding with Nianqiao.

185
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,571
It's easier to die than to live in this era.

186
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,685
But my Haitang...

187
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,914
should keep on living.

188
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,800
We'll be all right.

189
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,910
Zhang Qi, this surgery is also a big fight for you.

190
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,657
Promise me,

191
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,057
you have to win.

192
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,742
Okay.

193
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,571
Don't you lie to me!

194
00:16:56,285 --> 00:17:02,628
♫ The shimmer penetrates the crack of the clouds ♫

195
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:09,085
♫ I can't hide my thought of you ♫

♫ to carry the promise ♫

202
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,857
There's a bullet in the patient's chest.

203
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,640
It nears the coronary artery.

204
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,070
We're going to use the heart-lung machine

205
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:08,514
to perform a heart bypass surgery.

206
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:09,200

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,828
Come on, take a look.

213
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,685
On the surface, Bai Fei gave
democracy to Fuhua University.

214
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:42,228
In fact, he used Fuhua University,
the fortress of democracy

215
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:44,000
as his way to confront the central committee

216
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,000
and extend his personal power.

217
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,542
On one hand, he's acting
like a supporter of the scholars.

218
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,830
On the other hand, he hoarded grain,

219
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,285
inflated the prices and exploited the people.

220
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,742
He's the leading supplier of opium in Yunnan.

221
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:59,257
All opium dens in Kunming,
big or small, have to pay taxes to him.

222
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,828
Yunnan's economy is funded by the opium.

223
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,160
Bai Fei also used white terror tactics

224
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,428
when he did the Party Purge with the KTM in 1927.

225
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,440
He invited the left-wing to eat at his home.

226
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,680
It's said there were only four cuisines every time.

227
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,371
Four has the same pronunciation as death.

228
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,428
When the last plate hit the table,

229
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,542
there was a cover over it.

230
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:18,628
Guess what?

231
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:19,542
What?

232
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,285
There was a gun in it after the cover was removed.

233
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,200
A gun?

234
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,510
It's too frightening.

235
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, no!

236
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,720
Guys.

237
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,480
He even colluded with the traitors.

238
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,914
It's said the Japan didn't launch
a massive invasion of Yunnan

239
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:33,200
because of their secret settlements.

240
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:34,285
Do you know

241
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,857
someone on the ground gave a sign to the sky

242
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
when the Japanese aircraft
bombed Fuhua University?

243
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:40,830
He's a traitor.

244
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,440
You guys, we have to reveal the opportunist.

245
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,590
Overthrow this tyrant!

246
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,030
Reveal the opportunist!

247
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,640
Reveal this opportunist!

248
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,070
Overthrow the tyrant!

249
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,600
Count me in.

250
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,742
How do we do?

251
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,828
You don't look like one of Fuhua University.

252
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,228
I hate the Japanese and traitors most.

253
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:03,771
My brother was a pilot.

254
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,171
He died when he fought against the Japanese.

255
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,285
You know what, let's distribute these in the streets.

256
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,830
-Yes.
- Go.

257
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,480
Go.

258
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
Knock down the tyrant!

259
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,960
Overthrow the tyrant!

260
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,257
Down with the opportunist!

261
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:21,542
Overthrow the opportunist!

262
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,800
They posted that last week.

263
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,114
And they posted new ones today.

264
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,971
What's worse is, they're leafleting on the streets now.

265
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:30,571
They said they listed
ten terrible crimes against you.

266
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,571
That's pretty bad.

267
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,628
Supervisor, Fuhua University
is quite influential.

268
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,428
If the newsmen know that

269
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,140
and post it in the papers,

270
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:44,342
I'm afraid it'd damage your reputation badly.

271
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,542
Besides, Chongqing is messing with us.

272
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,028
Why are you still standing up here?

273
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,200
Go to invite them over here.

274
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,314
I'll invite them to eat dinner
with Nanyang Association.

275
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:08,280
Yes.

276
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,828
Now the prices in Kunming are too high.

277
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,514
Look, the students have little money.

278
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,800
We made sure that
they had chicken and eggs every week.

279
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:31,371
Now, they each have only an egg a week.

280
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,920
Look, they're growing.

281
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,428
How could they handle it?

282
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,885
Meng.

283
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,110
Sir.

284
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,160
- Hello, sir.
- Sir.

285
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,640
Well.

286
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,628
- Eat it.
- Thank you, sir.

287
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,628
You know what,

288
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,880
Lanshan and I will donate
our allowance to help out the kids.

289
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,342
Count me in,

290
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,828
then we have 69 professors
who have donated their allowance.

291
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,314
Our campus is not that bad.

292
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,200
Some students from other campuses
have only one meal a day.

293
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,428
They have to drink warm water for the rest two meals.

294
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,657
Meng, it's only temporary.

295
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,640
Yeah.

296
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,857
So, I have to go to Supervisor Bai
in the next day or two.

297
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:29,942
Let me tell you,

298
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,428
the high grain price in Kunming has to do with him.

299
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:34,342
Yes.

301
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,200
Something is up.

302
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,114
What's up?

303
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,800
Supervisor Bai took away several students.

304
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:43,828
Why?

305
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,942
There's a flyer posted outside.

306
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,457
It lists ten terrible crimes
against Supervisor Bai.

307
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,200
[The Operation Room]

308
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
How's it going, doctor?

309
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,571
We've taken out the bullet.

310
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,228
And the patient's heart beats again.

311
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,200
Great.

312
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,480
Haichen, send a letter home.

313
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,485
Yes.

314
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,914
The patient's will to live is strong.

315
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,371
The surgery went better than I could have hoped.

316
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:10,571
Now the closure is done.

317
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:11,640
But he's still in a coma.

318
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,600
We'll check on him for 48 hours.

319
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,428
If he's still stable, then he's out of the danger zone.

320
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,914

Why did you choose this song?

325
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:12,400
It's too difficult.

326

I think you play it well.

327
00:24:14,514 --> 00:24:15,657
We learned it.

328

- Let's try again.
- No.

329
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,371
This is Qi's favorite song.

330
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,085
Damn Bing Bing.

331
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:29,200
He still didn't allow me to go to the hospital.

332
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,285
I'll give him a lesson when he's discharged.

333
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,685
One is having a surgery. We don't know if he is alive.

334
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,160
The other one never goes to the hospital.

335
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,314
She's leaving herself in grief here.

336
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,942
Look, isn't it more painful?

337
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,880
Alright. Well, you first.

338
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,342
You play it better than me.

339
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,542
You first.

340
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,257
Quick.

341
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,514
Haitang.

342
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,200
Qianying.

343
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,142
You guys come here.

344
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,350
Go.

345
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,542
Ms. Kang.

346
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,171
I have good news for you.

347
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:20,971
Nianqiao had a letter delivered here.

348
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:22,971
He said Zhang Qi's surgery went well.

349
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:25,657
The doctor said they'd check on him for 48 hours.

350
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,200
That's great.

351
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,800
Thank goodness.

352
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:30,571
I'm very relieved.

353
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:32,285
Let's go to see him now.

354
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:33,371
- Go.
- Zhenzhu.

355
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,314
I want you to do something for me.

356
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,428
What's up, Ms. Kang?

357
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,657
Supervisor Bai took Li Donglai
and several students

358
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,142
because they leafleted on the streets.

359
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,857
He said he'd invite them to eat dinner.

360
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,914
Professor Meng has arrived at your dad's home.

361
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,790
Zhenzhu, you're my student.

362
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,828
By rights, I shouldn't bother you with those things.

363
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:04,800
But your father's operation is making us nervous.

364
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,228
Ms. Kang, you don't need to worry about it.

365
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:10,285
I'll ask him to release them.
I'm going back home right now.

366
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,942
Zhenzhu, I'll go with you.

367
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:13,030
You can go to see Bing Bing.

368
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,657
Zhang Qi will be worried
if he knows it when he wakes up.

369
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,228
Qianying, take Ms. Kang home
and wait to hear from us.

370
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,485
Thank you for playing the Song for the Homeless.

371
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,171
Nianqiao told me that I must stay with you.

372
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,228
Just go ahead.

373
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,310
You must be careful. Don't do anything rash.

374
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,240
Go.

375
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,400
Here's your tea.

376
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,590
Get in.

377
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,971
- Don't touch me.
- Behave well.

378
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,971
Get him in.

379
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,828
President Zhang, I was going to entertain you today.

380
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,085
But there's an accident.

381
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,457
You're a broad-minded businessman.

382
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,114
And you're a great scholar.

383
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,228
But I was born and raised in a tribe.

384
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,480
I'm just a rough guy.

385
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,314
However, I'm reasonable for everything.

386
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,028
I'm sorry.

387
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,720
I don't want to hide it from you.

388
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,742
I'll let you see the scandal.

389
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,710
Please judge who's right and who's wrong.

390
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,510
Hello, sir.

391
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,914
What a big trouble you've made!

392
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,240
Supervisor Bai, my students caused you trouble.

393
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,000
On behalf of the university,
I want to apologize to you.

394
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,800
Buchun, excuse me.

395
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,942
Wuran.

396
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,960
Let's sit and talk about these kids.

397
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,171
I believe Supervisor Bai is a man of reason.

398
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,314
Please.

399
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,285
Here.

400
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,680
Thank you.

401
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,200
Since Secretary General Meng is here,

402
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:57,828
good, please read it.

403
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,750
Well.

404
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,742
Let me.

405
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,371
Ten terrible crimes of Bai Fei in Yunnan.

406
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,057
First, he hoarded grain and inflated the price.

407
00:29:16,342 --> 00:29:21,371
Second, he cultivated opium and opened opium dens.

408
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,800
Third...

409
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,350
What's going on?

410
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,485
Minister.

411
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,600
I don't know. The situation got worse suddenly.

412
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:40,480
Isn't he going well?

413
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,640
Why is he in the operation room again?

414
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,830
I don't know. It's all of a sudden.

415
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,720
Excuse me, how's Zhang Qi?

416
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:46,240
He's bleeding internally suddenly.

417
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,000
Estimated blood loss, more than 1,000 ccs.

418
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,200
His aorta stops beating.

419
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,160
And he stopped breathing.

420
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,920
Dr. Chen made a diagnosis of
reopening his chest to find the source.

421
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,457
He needs transfusion at once.

422
00:29:54,571 --> 00:29:56,114
But we don't have enough type B blood.

423
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,030
Who is type B?

424
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,400
Me. Take my blood.

425
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,885
That's not enough.

426
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,542
Go to check your blood type over there.

427
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,750
- You come with me.
- Okay.

428
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,240
- I'm type A.
- Me too.

429
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,350
I'll bring type B students here.

430
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,000
Go.

431
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm going back to Barn Compound right now.

432
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:15,542
Tenth, he spoiled his daughter
and put her into the teaching class.

433
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Done.

434
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,800
These kids are too young and naive.

435
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,942
I'm apologizing to you for them.

436
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,114
They meant well?

437
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,714
The tenth crime alone,

438
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,142
if it gets to Chongqing and Mr. Chiang knows it,

439
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,828
besides, that's a rumor.

440
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:40,914
Shut up!

441
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,914
That's a rumor.

442
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:45,485
Mr. Meng, come on.

443
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,857
Sit.

444
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,270
I host a banquet in honor of

445
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,914
Mr. Zhang Buchun of
Nanyang Overseas Chinese Association

446
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,914
for appreciating his kindness.

447
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:01,942
He thinks about everything the country needs.

448
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,514
Looks like you didn't train your men well.

449
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,771
You can't handle these kids.

450
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,028
You even got them into my home,

451
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:13,880
which disturbs Mr. Zhang and Professor Meng.

452
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,485
How dare you scold them?

453
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,485
Since Mr. Zhang and Professor Meng know each other,

454
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,657
and these kids are all
Professor Meng's beloved students.

455
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,742
Let's sit at the table.

456
00:31:28,857 --> 00:31:31,142
We'll solve the problem while eating.

457
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:35,657
I don't think it's right for the kids to eat with you.

458
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:36,914
It's inappropriate.

459
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,480
These students don't think
things all the way through.

460
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,400
They want to advise you.

461
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,228
But they don't know the way.

462
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:50,440
In my opinion, they just want to give you advice.

463
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,542
They didn't mean anything by it.

464
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,257
Supervisor Bai, please do me the honor

465
00:31:57,428 --> 00:31:59,028
and let me take them back to the school.

466
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,085
I'll punish them severely.

467
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,942
There's something I have to tell you.

468
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,510
Buchun's son, our Anti-Japanese hero pilot

469
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,657
is having a big surgery right now.

470
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:15,314
We don't know if he is alive or not.

471
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,628
If you ask Buchun to stay and eat,

472
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:20,057
he'd have some concerns.

473
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,971
Why not let him go to see his son in the hospital?

474
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:23,440
Yeah.

475
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,342
It's on me.

476
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,057
I'll stay.

477
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,885
Mr. Zhang has a big heart.

478
00:32:34,457 --> 00:32:38,285
Why didn't you tell me about something this big?

479
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,750
You know what, I'll ask someone
to take care of your son.

480
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,720
No.

481
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,070
Since I host the feast, you should finish it.

482
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,720
Okay. If you insist.

483
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,828
No.

484
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,142
We're not hungry.

485
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,600
We're leaving if there's nothing.

486
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,371
Get the hell out of here!

487
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,514
Go!

488
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:09,885
Get the hell back to school!

489
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,270
Go!

490
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,030
Stop!

491
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,830
I'll stay.

492
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,085
Eat as much as you can.

493
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,857
I'm with you.

494
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,314
Just the usual.

495
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,028
Four cuisines.

496
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,971
All of them.

497
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,628
Pressure it.

498
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,000
Please take another bag.

499
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,257
I'm fine.

500
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,590
It's already 600 cc.

501
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,685
No more.

502
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,750
Just hold it.

503
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,200
I'll get you a bottle of milk.

504
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,028
Does my captain still need blood?

505
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,514
They've found one source.

506
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,550
He's still bleeding after the transfusion.

507
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,542
I'm asking you if he still needs blood.

508
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,200
Yes.

509
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,720
Okay, take mine.

510
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,640
Here, draw my blood.

511
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,800
You'd be dead.

512
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,971
Hold it. I'll get you a bottle of milk.

513
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:08,000
Please take another bag.

514
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,971
I'm really okay.

515
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,400
Drink it.

516
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:12,000
Excuse me.

517
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,371
I'm not type B.

518
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,428
What to do?

519
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,360
Take it easy.
I left an emergency letter in Barn Compound.

520
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,880
There must be someone who's type B.

521
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,960
I wish. May god bless him.

522
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,630
Not bleeding. No.

523
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:45,828
What?

524
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,085
You're not used to
the cuisines of Laodianpiao Hotel.

525
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,200
They're all worms. How to eat?

526
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,771
All right.

527
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,600
Since you don't like them, remove them.

528
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,971
Serve the fourth course.

529
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:21,670
Yes.

530
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,914
Take away the dishes.

531
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,857
Sir, you're so old but you still give blood.

532
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:40,510
You must drink two bottles of milk later.

533
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,485
Am I that old?

534
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,070
Father, why didn't you change
the shoes I bought for you?

535
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,440
Enough of this crap!

536
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,150
Meng is very nosy.

537
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,142
He asked for these shoes from you
and pushed them on me.

538
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,960
Father.

539
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,230
What?

540
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,150
I...

541
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,942
Look at your face, you're like a dead man.

542
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,630
Drink the milk.

543
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,057
Quick, drink.

544
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,000
Drink it.

545
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,371
It's said there were only four cuisines every time.

546
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,760
Four has the same pronunciation as death.

547
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,857
Until the last plate hit the table,

548
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,028
there was a cover over it.

549
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,000
There was a gun in it after the cover was removed.

550
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,657
What don't you eat?

551
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,314
You were afraid to see the worms.

552
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,028
Li Donglai.

553
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,914
Your brother is having a surgery right now.

554
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,771
Why don't you go to the hospital?

555
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,228
My brother?

556
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,200
His brother, Li Chunlai was an aviation martyr.

557
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,914
He died for the country.

558
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,800
His sworn brother is Buchun's son, Zhang Qi,

559
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,320
the captain of Hanguang Squadron.

560
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,714
I remember Captain Zhang helped Supervisor Bai

561
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:04,914
save a local kid in Fuhua three years ago.

562
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,142
Fuhua University, Supervisor Bai

563
00:38:07,314 --> 00:38:11,480
and officers, guys who're based in Kunming

564
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,320
are like family.

565
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,600
Therefore, some teenagers of Fuhua
are not thoughtful occasionally.

566
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,800
Supervisor Bai will give you a pass.

567
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,914
Mr. Meng, you just said,

568
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,314
my brother was having an operation in the hospital.

569
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,714
Why did nobody tell me?

570
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:30,571
Miss.

571
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,000
Just go.

572
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,285
Dad.

573
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,085
You're giving people four dishes again?

574
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,685
Why are you here?

575
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:46,910
Aren't you practicing the violin at school?

576
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,714
Look, Miss Meng is here, too.

577
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,057
You two go to keep practicing in the backyard.

578
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,142
No violin. I'm hungry.

579
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,514
I want to eat these four dishes with Donglai.

580
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,885
Haitang.

581
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,914
Haitang. Come on.

582
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,457
Sit here.

583
00:39:17,085 --> 00:39:20,400
Although I like you, you can't screw around with it

584
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:24,114
She's my daughter, Zhenzhu.

585
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,600
I'm sorry.

586
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,800
Uncle Zhang, nice to meet you.

587
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,971
Zhang Qi and I are old friends.

588
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,880
Never mind the formalities.

589
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,400
Okay.

590
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,685
This brutal man is my father.
People say he is a tyrant.

591
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,400
He always says I'm a little demon.

592
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,550
Look, it's the family feast of the tyrant.

593
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:50,514
Don't you think there's little point in it if I miss it?

594
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,828
I guess, my father probably thinks that
the food of Fuhua is not good.

595
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,960
So, he invited you to eat at home.

596
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,228
Perfect. Let's eat together.

597
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,200
Dad, serve the dishes.

598
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:11,714
You're talking nonsense.

599
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,590
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

600
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,542
How many dishes have been served now?

601
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,600
It's the fourth course.

602
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,114
The gun of that deputy is missing.

603
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,771
It must be on the plate.

604
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,628
Captain.

605
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,028
Huansheng.

606
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,542
You shouldn't be here now.

607
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,857
Huansheng.

608
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,600
I'm not able to fight in the sky now.

609
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:51,257
I'd rather die than live like this.

610
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,028
Take me with you.

611
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,771
You should go back.

612
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,114
Nianqiao and the guys are waiting for you.

613
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,228
Captain.

614
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,514
I can't go back.

615
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,571
Let me navigate you one last time.

616
