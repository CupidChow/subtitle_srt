[Episode 31]

3
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,560
Minister Tang,

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,040
what does it mean?

5
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,519
Do you have any evidence

6
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,640
to prove that I stopped them?

7
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
I've always been extremely disciplined.

8
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,760
And I'll get to the bottom

9
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,120
of the smuggling case!

10
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,719
Deputy Director Shao,

11
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,359
your account in Hong Kong, China,

12
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,599
takes in 150 grams of gold every month.

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,239
I figured

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,480
Vice Captain Fang gives you the money, right?

15
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,280
Tang Shizhen, you're a mad dog.

16
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,439
You even dare to mess with me.

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,400
Sit down.

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,479
Let's calm down.

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,599
Airplanes bring in big profits.

20
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,000
We're both hanging on by a thread.

21
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,080
Remember,

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,599
as long as I take you as my friend,

23
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,919
I'll try my best to defend you.

24
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,599
Why do you think the president's wife

25
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,159
looked for the catspaw several times,

26
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,439
but you're still alive and kicking?

27
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,280
Supervisor Bai,

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,759
you know exactly

29
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,520
which side you should take.

30
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,719
I'll personally ensure

31
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,400
the Yunnan Army is fairly treated.

32
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,680
Set your mind at rest.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,639
Tang Shizhen.

34
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,360
You've got a silver tongue,

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,960
but you don't get a vote.

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,159
It's two to one.

37
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,120
You've lost.

38
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,840
You know

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,599
I went to Chongqing the other day.

40
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,680
It's obviously not easy

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,759
to get Director Huang's written instruction.

42
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,840
Nianqiao.

43
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,000
You don't have to worry too much.

44
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,360
Captain Zhang took full responsibility for that.

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,840
Even if the court rules against us,

46
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,439
Chongqing will have the final say.

47
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,439
Relax.

48
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,000
My father thinks highly of Hanguang Squadron.

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,400
He will do something.

50
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,599
Lieutenant Li,

51
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,840
thank you.

52
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,240
Don't thank me.

53
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,919
I'm not just trying to save you.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,599
If you keep pampering Zhang Qi,

55
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,240
one day,

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,000
he'll be your doom.

57
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,199
I must warn you that

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,439
never warm a snake in your bosom.

59
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,199
Report!

60
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,120
Minister.

61
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,720
Urgent telegram.

62
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,120
Yesterday,

63
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,959
Japanese navy

64
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,439
launched a surprise air attack
on the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet.

65
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,079
Today,

66
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
the U.S. and the U.K.

67
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,839
officially declared war on Japan.

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
Japan's national policy has always aimed at

69
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,160
the domination of Asia and mastery of the Pacific.

70
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,319
Over the years,

71
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,879
China has resolutely
resisted Japan's aggression,

72
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,600
regardless of suffering and sacrifice.

73
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,639
The Chinese Government hereby
formally declares war on Japan.

74
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,680
The Chinese Government

75
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,079
further declares that

76
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,759
all agreements and contracts

77
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,399
regarding relations between China and Japan

78
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,199
are and remain null and void.

79
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,120
We just declared war.

80
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,879
So what were we fighting for

81
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,439
in the past ten years?

82
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,600
Now we're officially at war.

83
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,079
If America and Britain didn't do so,

84
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,240
I doubt whether our government

85
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,079
would dare to declare war on Japan.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,959
Now that the U.S. joins the fight,

87
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,120
will this affect Zhang Qi's case?

88
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,639
Zeng,

89
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,600
where are you going?

90
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,480
Somewhere I... I can't be blown up.

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,000
You're running again?

92
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,079
I am not.

93
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,560
This is called repositioning.

94
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,079
Alright, fine, go on.

95
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,160
Be careful.

96
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,920
Zhang Qi.

97
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,000
The verdict from Military Commission came out.

98
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,079
My father told me

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,519
the Americorps would be reorganized.

100
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,639
One group of our fighters

101
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,120
and one group of our bombers

102
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,959
will be incorporated

103
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,759
into the 23rd Destroyer Brigade of the U.S.

104
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,959
under their command.

105
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,480
The U.S. will supply

106
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,079
298 war planes within three months,

107
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,600
which means,

108
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
we will get aircraft and also pilots.

109
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,839
So you're saying

110
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,879
Hanguang Squadron

111
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
and our captain are no longer needed.

112
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,399
Nianqiao.

113
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,639
There's a co-pilot position open

114
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,720
and you can work for a big shot.

115
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,160
Would you like to consider it?

116
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,199
According to investigation,

117
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,759
Zhang Qi, Captain of Hanguang Squadron,

118
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,519
made great achievements in war,

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,680
but has got a perverse and arrogant personality.

120
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,759
He violated military rules,

121
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,399
and sympathizes with the communists.

122
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,639
He's no longer suitable

123
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,199
to continue serving in the air force.

124
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,600
From this day on, he's still
an active-duty member in the Army,

125
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,240
but his military ranks and titles are stripped.

126
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,480
He shall be transferred
to the Machinery Department,

127
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,079
continuing to receive political investigations.

128
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,839
All members of Hanguang Squadron

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,040
are incorporated into other brigades.

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,000
Hawk III Fighters in service

131
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,519
will retire successively.

132
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,040
You will be transferred from Kunming

133
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,439
and stay away from Lu Ziyi.

134
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,560
Remember what I'm going to say.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,759
If he investigates you, respond in kind.

136
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,839
He's not clean himself.

137
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,079
We can bring him down.

138
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,319
If you find any evidence, let me know,

139
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,959
and I'll take care of the rest.

140
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

141
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I've kept in mind.

142
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,240
Minister.

143
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,600
I've followed you for seven years.

144
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,639
I don't know

145
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,919
when we'll meet again.

146
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,679
I'm leaving.

147
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,440
Minister,

148
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,960
take care.

149
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,879
Big guy,

150
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
you're retiring, too.

151
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,360
How I wish we could fly one last time.

152
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,000
Sorry for making you worry all the time.

153
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,200
Don't say that.

154
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,559
It's not your fault.

155
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,000
You're not fully recovered yet.

156
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,679
And western Yunnan is humid.

157
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,759
This time,

158
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,759
can I go with you?

159
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,440
I cook and do laundry.

160
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,600
I can take care of you.

161

While I'm around,

162
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,440
I'll do all the chores.

163
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,639
I want my Haitang

164

to always be the happy little girl

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,360
Safeguard our magnificent homeland!

173
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,159
Everyone,

174
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,399
since Fuhua University

175
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,440
moved south from Peiping,

176
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,480
it had valued meticulous scholarship.

177
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,080
In the midst of war,

178
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,039
we still shouldn't give up studies.

179
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,960
Only by learning

180
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,600
can we achieve

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,200
national rejuvenation after the war.

182
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,679
Chongqing government

183
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,480
can't use students as cannon fodder

184
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,879
in their battles.

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,240
Have they ever

186
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,399
considered the future of our country?

187
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,519
The school officials

188
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,159
encourage students to join the military.

189
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,879
The war is raging.

190
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,320
If they don't go to the front,

191
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,399
our country will have no future.

192
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,600
You...

193
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,519
Guys.

194
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,039
Chongqing government is keen on civil war.

195
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,840
Therefore,

196
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,480
the school recommends us

197
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,399
to join Alpha Forces.

198
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,559
We'll fight in Burma

199
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,679
or join the translation team

200
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,039
as an Army translator

201
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:01,919
for the U.S. Air Force.

202
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,039
It'll both be joining the military,

203
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,519
but the result might be different.

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Listen,

205
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,120
you have to think it through.

206
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,080
You're still young.

207
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,919
Your job now is to study.

208
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,399
That's the priority.

209
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,399
Alright, enough.

210
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,759
No matter what it takes to fight the invaders,

211
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,639
I'll do it.

212
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:16,240
You...

213
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,159
Sir, count me in.

214
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,759
OK.

215
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,720
Me too! Me too!

216
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,240
Calm down.

217
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,879
My surname is Li.

218
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,159
Guys.

219
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,240
Guys, calm down.

220
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,639
Guys.

221
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,559
Dairong, have you decided?

222
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,440
You're too old

223
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,440
to join the Youth Army.

224
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,759
Senior.

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,480
I never said you were old,

226
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,600
but now you're judging me.

227
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,840
I didn't mean that.

228
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,559
I'm just saying

229
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,519
you're being overly impetuous.

230
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:52,879
Senior.

231
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,480
Why are you like the Chongqing government

232
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,440
who only knows to discourage people?

233
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,840
We've been losing the battles.

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,759
The way I see it,

235
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,519
it's because of the corrupted government

236
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,960
that our army becomes vulnerable.

237
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,360
Now we also have advanced weapons

238
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,240
from our allies.

239
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,559
I'm convinced that if more intellectuals

240
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,879
can pick up the guns and go to war just like me,

241
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,039
our troops

242
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
are likely to change,

243
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,519
so is our military situation.

244
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,919
I know, I get that.

245
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,000
But

246
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,919
teaching is your specialty.

247
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,720
You aren't good at fighting, are you?

248
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,399
Why not rethink it?

249
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,039
True, I'm a teacher.

250
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,480
But I have to do my part

251
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,399
to defend our country.

252
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:12,480
Lanshan.

253
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,919
Here are the flowers.

254
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
You're sending flowers again.

255
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,200
They look lovely today.

256
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,919
Oh, when are you leaving?

257
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,480
Tomorrow.

258
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
That soon?

259
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,559
Hold on.

260
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,960
I saw your pen was leaking,

261
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,399
so I bought you a new one.

262
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,480
Great!

263
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,000
I was just going to get a new pen.

264
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,200
Thanks.

265
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,519
Chen.

266
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,559
You used to send me flowers every week.

267
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,879
You're going to war tomorrow.

268
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,399
Take these flowers with you.

269
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,240
Thanks.

270
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,840
After we part,

271
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,600
I don't know when I'll see you again.

272
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,559
Take good care of yourself.

273
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,879
To be honest, my feelings for you

274
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,360
are the same as the way I feel

275
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,039
about our country.

276
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,960
I want nothing in return

277
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,200
and the passion will never fade.

278
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,000
Let me give you a salute.

279
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,080
Goodbye.

280
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,720
Goodbye.

281
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,360
Goodbye.

282
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,500
[December 1944, Western Yunnan]

283
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200
Enemy planes! Take cover!

284
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,759
Zhang Fugui.

285
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,839
Zhang Fugui.

286
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,079
Li Jin.

287
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,720
Li Jin.

288
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,440
Freeze.

289
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,279
Don't move.

290
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,359
Zhang Qi?

291
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,680
Perfect.

292
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,640
I've got a notebook over there.

293
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,880
Take it to Mr. Kang for me.

294
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,000
Stay where you are.

295
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:11,880
You're stepping on a blast mine.

296
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
Keep the pressure on your foot.

297
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,240
If I ask you to move,

298
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,519
immediately pull your foot out of your shoe.

299
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,039
That doesn't work.

300
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
Then what do you do?

301
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,160
It will explode once the pressure changes.

302
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,000
Pull out on the count of three.

303
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:39,759
One.

304
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,720
Two.

305
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:47,960
Three.

306
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,240
Take off your belt.

307
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,519
Here.

308
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,359
Use a knife

309
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,319
to dig out the earth around the mine.

310
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,720
OK.

311
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,480
Done.

312
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:35,920
Now

313
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,839
use your belt

314
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,599
to get through the mine slowly.

315
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,079
Remember to be slow.

316
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,880
When you get it through,

317
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:06,519
use the belt

318
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,559
to put pressure on the mine.

319
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,000
Make sure the pressure is strong enough.

320
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,319
A little bit less,

321
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,480
and the mine will explode.

322
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,480
Can you do it?

323
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,039
Yes.

324
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,400
I can.

325
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,079
Zhang Qi, I'm ready.

326
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,200
Give me your order.

327
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
I count to three,

328
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,319
and we let go together.

329
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,160
Alright, alright.

330
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,079
One.

331
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,599
Two.

332
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,839
Three.

333
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,200
Zhang Qi.

334
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,759
I didn't know you could disarm landmines.

335
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,039
Aren't you a pilot?

336
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,720
I'm not a pilot anymore,

337
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,079
but a mechanic.

338
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,920
I've been fixing planes for almost three years,

339
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,000
so I've become flexible.

340
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,559
And before,

341
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,240
I studied blast mines.

342
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,119
Why are you here?

343
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,680
Long story.

344
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,200
By the way,

345
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,240
have you got quinine with you?

346
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,640
What's wrong?

347
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,880
Are you ill?

348
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,160
Or you aren't recovered from the last injury?

349
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,200
It's not me.

350
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,440
It's someone else.

351
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,079
Who is it that needs quinine?

352
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,599
Have some water.

353
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,599
Father.

354
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,240
Father.

355
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,839
Is he having malaria?

356
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,839
I don't have quinine.

357
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,960
This disease is hard to be cured.

358
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,960
What happened to you?

359
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,559
A month ago...

360
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,830
[Zhijiang Air Base]

361
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,880
We can get some good stuff

362
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,039
when we fly over the humps.

363
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,079
Still flying planes?

364
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,640
Not anymore.

365
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,640
I've applied to return

366
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,880
the Sino-American Mixed Brigade.

367
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,720
From today,

368
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,160
we can spend time together again.

369
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,960
Then I'll take care

370
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,440
of your plane.

371
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,519
Deal.

372
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,079
Well,

373
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,880
now we've taken Bhamo,

374
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,759
it won't be long

375
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,039
before we take the China-India Air Route back.

376
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What matters most now is Mongyu.

377
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,480
Once we take it,

378
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,400
Ledo Road

379
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,319
and Burma Road can be connected,

380
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,359
and oil can be moved between
China and India through the pipelines.

381
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,039
We'll never be short of combat fuel anymore.

382
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:26,960
I remember,

383
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,279
Lieutenant Li

384
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,000
asked you to be the co-pilot for a big shot,

385
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,079
but you refused.

386
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,480
Instead,

387
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,200
you've been flying over humps for three years.

388
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,039
Now you still get this lofty spirit.

389
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,440
The superiors have approved the proposal

390
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,200
to establish a temporary
underground party branch

391
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,559
for The Air Force Officer School.

392
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,160
I got the order

393
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,319
to come and meet you.

394
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,079
Though the nationalists were defeated
in the campaign, Operation Ichi-Go,

395
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,559
having lost 146 cities,

396
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,440
and seven air bases,

397
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,880
the Japanese suffered heavy losses

398
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,079
from the Battle of Leyte Gulf,

399
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,119
and never sailed to battle like that.

400
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,720
On the battlefields in Yunnan, Burma and India,

401
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,720
our armies launched counter-attacks
and yielded fruitful results.

402
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,519
So the main task for the moment

403
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,440
is to assist the NRA in the fuel oil project,

404
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,559
restore the air power,

405
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:26,960
and take back our control of air.

406
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,839
Speaking of fuel oil,

407
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,720
last week,

408
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,559
Plane P-51 2253 of Zhijiang

409
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,839
exploded on its way back.

410
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,440
The plane crashed and the pilot was killed.

411
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,359
For three years in a row,

412
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,640
this is the 25th accident

413
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,359
if we count the 428 Aerial Battle.

414
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,839
I checked the remains of the fuel tank

415
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,039
and found that the antidetonator

416
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,440
by Cox Company in America with stable performance.

417
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,079
But why did it still explode?

418
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,880
Is it because of the antidetonator or the fuel oil?

419
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,519
I did some research,

420
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,440
and found one thing in common in these 25 accidents.

421
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
The fuel they used

422
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,519
were all imported from Jing'an Oilfield in Myanmar

423
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,599
by a trading company called Evergreen.

424
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,480
Jing'an again?

425
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:18,240
Yes.

426
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,599
Jing'an again.

427
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,039
They replace the expensive high octane fuel

428
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,240
with the cheap low octane fuel,

429
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,720
and pocket the wide trading spreads.

430
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,720
If that's true,

431
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,720
even though the antidetonator is fine,

432
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,359
our war planes

433
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,200
still have a risk of exploding.

434
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,200
So you're saying

435
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,759
my father's calculation was right?

436
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,480
Yeah.

437
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,200
I did the math over and over again.

438
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,759
Mr. Zeng can't be wrong.

439
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,759
I haven't found

440
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,319
the registration of ownership
of Jing'an Oldfield.

441
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,599
But I found out something else.

442
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,079
The general manager of Evergreen

443
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,079
is named Lu Zhaoming.

444
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,559
He's also

445
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,319
Lu Ziyi's cousin.

446
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,119
Lu Ziyi?

447
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,559
It's him again.

448
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,319
What do you have in mind?

449
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,680
Evergreen trading company

450
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,000
dissolved in this June.

451
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,839
And the last oil depot in the country exploded.

452
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,079
I didn't get the sample.

453
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:16,960
I suspect

454
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,759
this Evergreen trading company

455
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,920
changed the name

456
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,079
and kept supplying our planes with fuel.

457
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,640
If this is the case,

458
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,200
such accidents that Xishan and 2253 had

459
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,759
would happen again.

460
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,960
If Lu Ziyi is behind all these,

461
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,240
we have to get a sample

462
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,960
of the fuel oil for analysis.

463
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,759
We need to go to Jing'an.

464
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,400
I was going to fly Hongshi.

465
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,200
I'll fill out an application

466
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,319
so we can go to Jing'an together.

467
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,240
Let's leave tomorrow.

468
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,039
Before we crashed,

469
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,640
we were above the Yemang Mountain.

470
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,559
Yemang Mountain

471
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,240
is like a mass grave.

472
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,960
The magnetic field is chaotic.

473
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,720
It sure deserves the name.

474
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,359
We're back to where we were.

475
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:05,480
The mosquitoes here

476
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,880
are even larger than P-40.

477
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,440
Let's go.

478
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,480
Do you feel better?

479
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,960
This is malignant malaria.

480
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,519
I know about this disease.

481
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,200
It will relapse.

482
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,319
Where are we now?

483
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,240
Oh,

484
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,039
where's my bag?

485
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:00,440
Here.

486
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,920
The files for Mr. Zeng.

487
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,319
Protect them well.

488
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,119
Take a rest.

489
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,640
Let's keep going in a while.

490
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:08,720
OK.

491
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,599
Zeng Nianqiao.

492
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,920
A Chinese pilot.

493
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,720
There! Catch them alive!

494
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,440
You guys go search over there.

495
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,200
The rest of you follow me.

496
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,519
Captain.

497
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,400
There should be

498
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,319
one last bullet in my gun.

499
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,240
Give it to me.

500
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,720
I didn't know you're still sober.

501
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,559
Give me.

502
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,279
Give me.

503
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,599
Give me.

504
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,000
Give me the gun.

505
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,000
No Chinese pilot can be taken prisoner.

506
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,880
This isn't the last minute.

507
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,440
Don't give up and die like this.

508
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,319
Comrade Zhanlu.

509
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,599
Comrade Zhanlu.

510
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:16,839
They're here.

511
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:17,440
Search!

512
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,720
Comrade Zhanlu.

513
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,079
We can't both die here.

514
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:27,160
I now command you
as the Party Secretory

515
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,200
of the temporary underground party branch

516
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,680
of The Air Force Officer School,

517
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,079
leave right away with the documents.

518
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,200
When have I followed

519
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:40,960
any unreasonable commands?

520
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,240
Captain.

521
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,880
Captain, Captain.

522
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,759
How about this? Listen.

523
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,240
Let's flip a coin.

524
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,759
If you lose,

525
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,160
get... get out of here, okay?

526
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,720
If you don't leave,

527
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,720
I'll shoot myself now.

528
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,400
Ding!

529
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,400
Same old rule.

530
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,200
We're both soldiers.

531
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,400
Be a good loser.

532
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:08,760
OK.

533
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,039
Let's take the chance.

534
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:11,760
Alright.

535
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,239
This is Ding's coin.

536
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
You can't fool me.

537
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,119
Use mine.

538
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,239
The head.

539
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,440
And the tail.

540
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,400
Choose one.

541
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,119
Flip it.

542
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:46,719
OK.

543
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,400
I choose...

544
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,599
I choose neither.

545
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,599
Search along the river bank.

546
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,280
Nianqiao.

547
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,559
It's all right.

548
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,679
I'm fine.

549
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,320
I'm not gonna die, Captain.

550
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,199
You were good.

551
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,760
Captain, put me down.

552
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,239
Why didn't you follow my command?

553
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,239
My biggest regret is that

554
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,039
I couldn't bring Ding back alive.

555
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,920
Do you think

556
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,320
he can still see us now?

557
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:20,760
Yes.

558
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,880
I haven't asked you.

559
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,199
So

560
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,920
how did you respond to Qianying?

561
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,079
Nianqiao.

562
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,920
Do you like me?

563
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,880
I do.

564
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,880
In the same way as a brother likes his sister

565
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,760
or as Qi likes Haitang?

566
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,079
Qianying.

567
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,199
Actually, I...

568
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,000
I haven't had time

569
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,119
to tell her the answer.

570
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,480
If we could make it out of Yemang Mountain alive,

571
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,119
I'd definitely tell her.

572
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,079
Yeah.

573
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,639
If we could leave here alive...

574
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,360
Qianying, Qianying.

575
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,639
Qianying.

576
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,519
How time flies.

577
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,360
In my memory,

578
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,239
they are still a group of lovely children.

579
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,760
How I wish the war would end.

580
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,199
Under the shady trees,

581
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,199
beside the raging river,

582
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,480
in the lost June and July,

583
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,639
and on the deserted hills,

584
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,679
your bodies are still struggling to return home.

585
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,880
Nameless wildflowers are blooming on your heads.

586
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,440
The hunger,

587
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,039
the flash floods,

588
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,960
the poisonous insects,

589
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,920
and the miserable nights,

590
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,960
you couldn't stand them

591
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,639
and got stories to tell.

592
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,360
But now,

593
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,920
lush green trees have covered this place.

594
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,280
The past is behind us.

595
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,320
Before,

596
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,920
you fought for lives.

597
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,199
You sacrificed

598
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:07,679
so the living people could survive.

599
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:28,980
[May 1925 to July 1944]

600
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,519
They are the young soldiers
who died in the Battle of Western Yunnan.

601
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,599
In the Battle of Mount Song,

602
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,000
7,000 people died.

603
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,880
The youngest among them
was only nine years old.

604
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:03,700
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

605
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:11,600
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

612
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:57,580
