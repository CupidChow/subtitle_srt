[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
[Episode 39]

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,200
Your mom and I spent a long time

4
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,519
preparing your dowry.

5
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,280
Then the war broke out.

6
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,280
Everything we have is right in front of you.

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,239
Father, I don't need dowry.

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,079
Although we're living a poor life,

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,159
we pursue a spiritual existence.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,719
I wrote you a piece of calligraphy.

11
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,760
More important is serving the country.

12
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,840
More gorgeous is a faithful heart.

13
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,759
Do you understand what it's saying?

14
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,039
Aiju.

15
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,319
Our children are so great.

16
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,840
We are proud of Haitang and Haichen.

17
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,759
Let's put on this wedding veil.

18
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,879
Let me take a look.

19
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,960
Sure.

20
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,120
Let's see.

21
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,919
My daughter is getting married.

22
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,560
Mr. Ling, I'm sorry.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,439
Meng has been absentminded recently.

24
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,360
Haitang is getting married.

25
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,360
He's missing her already.

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,039
I can understand that.

27
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,599
Please take my long gown out.

28
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,680
I'll wear it tomorrow.

29
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,919
Don't forget to iron it.

30
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,240
Sure.

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,039
Recently,

32
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,039
I've been practicing divination.

33
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,759
It's either the bird burns its nest

34
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,680
or the last sound of the decreased.

35
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,280
All signs of bad luck.

36
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,680
But you're not superstitious.

37
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,719
I'm worried that

38
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,080
something might occur

39
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,759
to our memorial ceremony tomorrow.

40
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,240
Wuran.

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,599
Don't worry about that.

42
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,759
As the saying goes,

43
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,159
no need to be afraid of tax officials if you owe no tax,

44
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,039
no need to be worried about your destiny
if you never cheat.

45
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,719
Divination has a long history.

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
Before King Wu Ding marched,

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,719
he had it.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,160
So did King Wu of Zhou before going out for battles.

49
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,959
When King Wu of Zhou suppressed King Zhou,

50
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,040
three signs of bad luck.

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,319
Jiang Ziya told King Wu

52
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,399
going against one's destiny isn't always bad,

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,439
following god's will could be bad, too.

54
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,240
What's vital is the common aspiration.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
After hearing it,

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
King Wu of Zhou burnt all the oracle bones

57
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,160
and set off beating drums.

58
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,800
In the end, he wiped King Zhou of Shang out.

59
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,160
It all depends on human efforts.

60
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,199
Exactly.

61
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,199
Mr. Ling.

62
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,439
I'm afraid that's not why you're here today.

63
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,759
Since we came to the south,

64
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,800
I've been thinking.

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,240
Scholars like us are really useless.

66
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,480
All we do is to sit inside a chamber,

67
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,160
reading and writing.

68
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,279
We're swayed by gain and loss.

69
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,319
Turn the other cheek and stand the insult.

70
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,079
In a disaster-ridden country,

71
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,639
what could we do?

72
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,319
How will we build up a new world?

73
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,480
Where's the future of our country?

74
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
We should learn from the young people.

75
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,759
They are ambitious and adventurous.

76
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,839
What they're pursuing

77
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,759
is the future of China

78
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,879
and the hope of China.

79
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,000
We shall find a party, an organization,

80
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,399
which is devoted to this country and the people.

81
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Aid this party

82
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,040
while it leads Chinese people on the right path,

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,759
a path to a happy and bright new world.

84
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Are you talking about...

85
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,079
The record of a meteor shower.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,279
Where all stars head to the west.

87
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,759
That's where the hope lies.

88
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,600
You just read my mind!

89
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,240
Yan'an!

90
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,360
Zou Shenghong.

91
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,319
Captain.

92
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,560
You're aware that

93
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,360
I'm no longer your captain.

94
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,959
You're a combat officer of the sixth squadron

95
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,360
of 409 Bombing Brigade.

96
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,160
I can't believe you're here

97
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,399
because you disobeyed the order

98
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,639
to bomb the communists' supply line.

99
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Would you drop the bombs if you were there?

100
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,120
- Airplane!
- Airplane!

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
An airplane!

102
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Plane!

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,839
The order was to bomb the supply line.

104
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,519
But what I saw were villages!

105
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,680
Last week,

106
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,240
The Ninth Bombing Brigade bombed

107
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,600
more than 100 people.

108
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,759
The victims were not communists.

109
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,360
They were women and children!

110
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,399
We are doing the same thing

111
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,600
as the invaders did!

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,519
After years of war,

113
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,000
the Japanese are defeated.

114
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,519
I thought our life would be peaceful.

115
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,839
But now,

116
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,120
we're killing our fellowmen!

117
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,879
Captain,

118
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,079
I'm tired.

119
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,120
Tired of the orders.

120
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,319
I want to ask you for a favor.

121
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,879
Take care of my fiancee,

122
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,519
Shuqin.

123
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,000
On the record,

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,959
the sixth squadron disobeyed the order

125
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,000
because of bad weather and technical difficulties.

126
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,120
I don't want any turmoil.

127
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,560
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,000
Which squadron should we send

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,920
to continue the mission?

130
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,040
Take a walk with me.

131
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,960
Are you from Changchun?

132
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,919
No, sir. I'm from Siping.

133
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,080
Siping.

134
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,279
There was a big battle there in spring.

135
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,960
I thought we'd have a truce

136
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,879
after the consultative conference.

137
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,039
Instead, we fought with the communists.

138
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,360
I didn't quite understand.

139
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,679
Seeing from that,

140
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,679
the superior is determined

141
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,639
to settle it with the communists.

142
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,799
The consultative conference

143
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,759
isn't for Central Club or soldiers.

144
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,799
Prepare for the fight.

145
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,480
The sooner we win,

146
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
the faster you can go home.

147
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,519
It's been a long time since my last visit to Hangzhou.

148
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,159
Don't know if I could go there again.

149
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,360
Sir, our superior says

150
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,360
if the communists don't surrender,

151
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,960
we will wipe them out in less than a year.

152
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,559
The last time Director inspected us,

153
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,399
he said that

154
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,679
we have 40 mechanized divisions

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,799
and hundreds of fighter jets from the Americans.

156
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,799
The communists cannot match.

157
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,399
We could wipe them out

158
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,399
in three to six months.

159
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,279
After the fight with them in July

160
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,720
in Northern Jiangsu,

161
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,559
there are battles everywhere.

162
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,600
From what we know,

163
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,840
the communists cannot afford long fights.

164
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,320
To eradicate the communists soon,

165
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,360
I will send Hanguang Squadron

166
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,799
to bomb Northeast China.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,879
Are you thinking about promoting Zhang Qi?

168
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,159
I hope what Sixth Squadron did

169
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,279
wouldn't happen again.

170
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,720
If it did, you'd be embarrassed.

171
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,159
Zhang Qi.

172
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,639
Zhang Qi.

173
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,000
He's my student.

174
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,919
He's a talent, one of a kind.

175
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,120
Although he could be rash,

176
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,159
our party needs a talent like him.

177
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,120
If he could devote himself to the party,

178
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,759
we can forgive him for what he did.

179
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,080
This mission is a test for him, too.

180
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,240
If he has second thoughts,

181
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,080
we have no choice

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,159
but to get rid of him.

183
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,240
Alright, you may go back.

184
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,039
I need some time on my own.

185
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,799
Yes, sir.

186
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
Is the sky over Jianqiao Airport as blue as here?

187
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,519
Hanguang Squadron, follow my order.

188
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,480
Take 673 to Luoyang at 22:00, on 10th October.

189
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,759
Once you arrive,

190
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,120
pilot P-47 fighter bombers and take off.

191
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,320
The bombers will be fully loaded.

192
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,720
Your target is the newly-founded base

193
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,240
of the communists' aviation school.

194
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,120
The goal is to wipe out their so-called

195
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,440
air force before its establishment.

196
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm counting on you.

197
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,320
Our party is counting on you.

198
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,519
Zeng Nianqiao.

199
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,399
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,159
You have a different mission.

201
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,240
You're not part of this mission.

202
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,559
Chen Ran.

203
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,360
Yes, sir.

204
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,399
You're transferred back to Hanguang Squadron

205
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,600
to help them out.

206
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,080
Before you set off,

207
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,639
hand out your IDs.

208
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,399
We will secure them.

209
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Do you hear me?

210
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,200
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

211
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,720
Zhang Qi, it's your wedding day the day after.

212
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:49,720
Should you change the date?

213
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,799
Minister.

214
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
My fiancee has been waiting for years.

215
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,600
I shall stick to my promise.

216
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,279
You have my word.

217
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,679
I will keep it simple.

218
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,200
I dare not to misconduct.

219
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,799
I know my priority.

220
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,759
Okay.

221
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,480
While you carry out the mission,

222
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,080
I will send guards to protect Ms. Meng.

223
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,399
Yes, sir.

224
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,080
It's been a long time, Kunming.

225
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,720
Commissioner Lu.

226
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,320
As you ordered,

227
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,960
your flight away from Kunming

228
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,879
will be at 21:40, on 11th October.

229
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,919
You will take a transport plane to Beiping.

230
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,759
You will be flying

231
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,039
with professors of Fuhua University.

232
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,399
The captain will be Zeng Nianqiao.

233
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,879
Good.

234
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,799
Lieutenant Li.

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,679
I asked you to pick me up.

236
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,360
On the one hand,

237
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,960
your father asked me

238
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,320
to check on his daughter.

239
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,080
On the other,

240
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,399
the party needs talents.

241
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,200
The mission tomorrow

242
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,879
will be an evaluation as well.

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,159
Don't let me down.

244
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,879
Yes, sir!

245
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,519
Look at Fuhua University today.

246
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,480
Scholars don't stick to their jobs.

247
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
They join Democratic League,

248
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,279
and interfere with the government.

249
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,720
There are even some communists.

250
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,960
The authorities in Nanjing think that

251
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,279
in the activity Fuhua University holds tomorrow,

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,240
the scholars will promote
the communists' declarations,

253
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,159
slandering our government and stirring up trouble.

254
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,559
Same old stuff.

255
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,600
National Assembly is afoot.

256
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,679
To protect the people

257
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,000
and stick to constitutionalism,
we will wipe out the rebels.

258
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,639
There will be no room

259
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,080
for so-called democracy or third parties.

260
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,039
The communists are not tolerated!

261
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:57,879
As a result,

262
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,360
we must wipe out the rebels.

263
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,080
That's an order from Nanjing.

264
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,960
Yes, sir.

265
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,559
Commissioner Lu,

266
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,120
is there any specific instruction for me?

267
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,360
Calm down.

268
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,600
Deputy Zhang.

269
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,159
Yes, sir.

270
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,960
Get Kunming garrison command

271
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,600
and the thirteenth division of military police.

272
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,120
Make sure we have enough units tomorrow.

273
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,399
What's more,

274
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,879
make it clear to them.

275
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,840
They could go all out when attacking.

276
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,960
It's their chance to get promotion.

277
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,480
Understand?

278
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,320
Yes, sir.

279
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,240
As for you,

280
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,639
your task is simple

281
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,679
yet highly important.

282
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,360
Keep an eye on this man.

283
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,399
I believe

284
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,960
he's a communist hidden inside.

285
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,639
You must not let him go this time.

286
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,720
Yes, sir.

287
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,519
Hello?

288
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,679
Secretary-general Meng,

289
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,879
it's been a while.

290
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,159
How may I help you?

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,879
In the past 14 years of wartime,

292
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,200
Fuhua University spends
[Stop Civil War for Peace]

293
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,799
8 years and 11 months here.

294
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,480
Over the past eight years,

295
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,799
soldiers have been fighting hard at the front,

296
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,480
protecting our country.

297
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,960
While we, students and teachers of Fuhua,

298
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,919
stand our post on the Southwest corner,

299
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,440
protecting our culture.

300
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,960
We have preserved the fire of Chinese culture.

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,720
I am begging you

302
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,120
to remember the past eight years.

303
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,799
Wherever you are,

304
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,960
it's our duty and obligation

305
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,759
to pass on the fire of Chinese Culture,

306
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,440
to spread it all over China,

307
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,600
and across the world.

308
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,399
On behalf of our university,

309
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,639
thank you.

310
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,519
Here, I announce,

311
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,200
from today,

312
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,039
Fuhua University

313
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,919
ends its journey to the south.

314
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,039
We will return north!

315
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,440
Bravo!

316
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,279
Bravo!

317
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,400
Bravo!

318
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Students.

319
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,599
I want to show you a few pictures.

320
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,799
Qianying.

321
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,440
On March 27th,

322
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,240
the KMT tore apart the truce

323
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,119
and provoked civil war in Northeast China.

324
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,160
On October 4th,

325
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,440
the KMT bombed Mudanjiang,

326
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,680
killing 167 civilians.

327
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,440
Is that what they mean

328
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,920
founding a new country peacefully
by avoiding civil war?

329
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,480
Shouldn't we condemn them

330
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
for what they've done?

331
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,880
We must condemn!

332
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,279
We must condemn!

333
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,799
We must condemn!

334
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,160
What happened over the past year

335
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,079
deeply disappoint us.

336
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,599
It also gives us a warning.

337
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,599
On December 1st,

338
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,440
students in Kunming were massacred

339
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,720
when they were protesting against the civil war.

340
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
Three months ago,

341
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,440
Mr. Li Gongpu

342
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,640
and Mr. Wen Yiduo

343
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,960
was assassinated in Kunming.

344
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,519
In Fuhua University,

345
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,559
over the past nine years,

346
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:19,519
over 200 students died.

347
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,200
We must remember the sacrifice.

348
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
We must not forget.

349
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:31,200
We never forget.

350
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,960
Just as I expected.

351
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,319
We never forget.

352
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,599
We never forget.

353
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,359
We never forget.

354
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,759
We never forget.

355
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,119
We never forget.

356
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,559
We never forget.

357
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,400
We never forget.

358
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,880
We never forget.

359
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,160
Secretary-general Meng was right.

360
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,039
I confirmed it with Mr. Lu.

361
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,200
Just like Meng said,

362
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,119
there will be a transfer order next week

363
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,880
to remove all my positions.

364
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,640
I'd be the vice director

365
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,319
of Strategic Advisory Committee.

366
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,680
What is that committee about?

367
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,000
It's a sinecure with no power at all.

368
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,640
Chiang is depriving me

369
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,759
of my military power and political power.

370
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,200
What should we do now?

371
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,880
What is the salutation in Fuhua University?

372
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm afraid it's a mess already.

373
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,079
We must not follow Nanjing's order.

374
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,079
Instead,

375
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,039
we must act against them.

376
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,960
Whatever they're against,

377
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,480
we will support it.

378
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,960
Chiang is trying to get rid of me.

379
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,480
We have no choice

380
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,559
but to do it at all cost.

381
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,880
Head-to-head.

382
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,759
Let's go to Fuhua.

383
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,640
Yes, sir.

384
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,240
Inside this hall,

385
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,839
there are teachers, students of our university

386
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:09,519
and some irrelevant people at the door.

387
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,720
Well.

388
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,960
I'll take this chance and deliver a speech.

389
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,519
Read the newspaper in your hand.

390
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,240
Students.

391
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,599
What is this assembly for?

392
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,279
It's for peace.

393
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,480
For the democracy and freedom of China.

394
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,559
As you know,

395
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,400
Double Tenth Agreement just comes out.

396
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,200
But the civil war is approaching.

397
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,440
China will be covered by gunfire again.

398
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,599
The country may be at war again.

399
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,799
Once again, the people will suffer.

400
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,559
Together,

401
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,880
we shall cherish the memory of Fuhua alumni

402
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,799
who sacrificed for this country.

403
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,960
There are Professor Jin Zhilie,

404
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,200
and Professor Zeng Mu.

405
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,799
Their souls

406
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,680
keep reminding us,

407
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,839
and questioning us.

408
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,480
Teachers and students of Fuhua.

409
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,319
Will you pay the price for freedom?

410
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,359
My answer is

411
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,759
we do not fear death.

412
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,480
Don't fear death!

413
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,599
- Don't fear death!
- Don't fear death!

414
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,960
- Don't fear death!
- Don't fear death!

415
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,759
- Don't fear death!
- Don't fear death!

416
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,440
Stop civil war! We want democracy!

417
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,119
Stop civil war! We want democracy!

418
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,799
Stop civil war! We want democracy!

419
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,319
Stop civil war! We want democracy!

420
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,519
Stop civil war!

421
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,400
Protect Mr. Ling.

422
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,079
Why are you here?

423
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,279
Stop beating us!

424
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,119
What do you want?

425
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,319
Stop the violence!

426
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,480
What do you want?

427
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,920
Stop the violence!

428
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,680
Stop the violence!

429
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,720
How could you do that?

430
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,039
Don't you beat them!

431
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:02,680
Stop it!

432
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,640
Stop the violence!

433
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,599
Stop it!

434
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,880
Sir, what should we do?

435
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,519
Bai Zhenzhu.

436
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,519
I suspect she's a communist.

437
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,000
Keep an eye on her.

438
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:38,359
Yes, sir.

439
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,519
Stop the violence!

440
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,279
Stop it.

441
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:41,920
What are you doing?

442
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,759
Haitang.

443
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,880
Stop the violence.

444
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,440
Stop it!

445
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,319
- Mr. Ling.
- Stop!

446
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,440
Move!

447
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,920
Dad.

448
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,160
Dad.

449
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,119
Zhenzhu, are you alright?

450
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,880
I'm fine.

451
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,319
Professor Meng. Professor Ling.

452
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,119
You...

453
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,279
Thank you.

454
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,440
Thanks.

455
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,279
Killing innocent people.

456
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,160
This is the end of your time!

457
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
[Wanbaoquan Tailor Shop]

458
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,480
Comrade Zhenzhu.

459
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:41,160
You might have been exposed

460
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,839
in the assembly.

461
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,359
How could you be so reckless?

462
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,599
Ms. Bai did it to protect Mr. Ling.

463
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,519
That doesn't give you the reason

464
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,599
to violate our rule.

465
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,680
I accept the criticism.

466
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,880
What I did today

467
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,960
might bring stronger surveillance.

468
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,200
I want the party

469
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,480
to have a new liaison

470
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,799
for Comrade Zhanlu.

471
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,759
Waiting for your messages to know you're safe.

472
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,759
I'm applying to join the army to distinguish myself.

473
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,039
Haitang?

474
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,279
We are being followed.

475
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:02,799
Why are you here?

476
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,599
It's Chengying.

477
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:05,960
In Beiping,

478
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,000
when you took me out,

479
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,799
I got to know her through a pearl.

480
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,319
As time goes by,

481
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,519
I'm sure

482
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,759
she is the same kind of person as you are.

483
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,079
She leads me to the brightness.

484
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,079
Let's make it short.

485
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,440
She's been targeted.

486
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,039
For safety concerns,

487
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,200
I will take her place

488
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
to help you finish your task.

489
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,839
The KMT has torn apart the truce.

490
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,359
They will launch a general war.

491
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,480
Given the current situation,

492
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
the only way to bring peace to China

493
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,400
is by force.

494
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,559
Comrade Zhanlu.

495
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,039
Comrade Chunjun's and your proposal

496
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,079
of the uprising on October 11th

497
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,799
during the bombing mission is approved.

498
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,839
You shall fly to Yan'an and have a short break.

499
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,200
Then, you will be sent

500
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,160
to the newly found Aviation School

501
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,039
of Democratic Allied Army.

502
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,839
That's our aviation school.

503
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,000
It was built

504
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,960
for the backbones of our future air force.

505
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,319
Hanguang Squadron

506
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,960
is ready for the uprising on October 11th.

507
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,799
We shall discuss about the detailed plan.

508
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,839
It's our wedding day.

509
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,160
I'm a little worried about the mission.

510
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,240
Haitang.

511
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,759
October 11th.

512
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,400
It should be the happiest moment of our life.

513
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:42,200
But Tang Shizhen is suspecting me already.

514
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,200
If I miss it,

515
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,599
there will be no second chance.

516
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,640
Later,

517
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,039
- I will make it up for you with a more...
- Zhang Qi.

518
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,000
You're the only thing that matters.

519
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm just worried that

520
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
you'd have a hard time

521
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,640
adapting to the life there.

522
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,880
Promise me.

523
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,000
Eat on time. Don't be picky.

524
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,119
I will wait for your return.

525
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,799
Hanguang Squadron and Zhang Qi

526
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,720
guarantee to fulfill the task.

527
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,920
It's my greatest happiness

528
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,880
to fight by your side.

529
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:52,880
Minister.

530
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,920
This is the invitation to my wedding ceremony.

531
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,680
Please be our chief witness.

532
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,160
Congratulations.
[To Mr. Tang Shizhen]

533
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,200
I will show up on time.

534
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,319
By the way,

535
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,240
teachers and students of Fuhua

536
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,640
will return to the north in a month.

537
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,839
They must be packing up now.

538
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,960
It will be a long journey.

539
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
The superior gave out the order.

540
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,440
Teachers like Professor Ling and Professor Meng

541
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,440
are national treasures.

542
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,400
We will send jets to escort them.

543
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,480
Fortunately,

544
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,960
there is a transport plane to Beiping.

545
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,480
After the ceremony,

546
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,240
Meng's and Ling's family

547
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,640
will take the plane to Beiping.

548
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,119
Don't worry.

549
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,680
I will send guards

550
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,599
to take care of Ms. Meng.

551
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,880
Don't worry about her.

552
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,599
That's the best.

553
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,559
I don't want Haitang

554
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,920
to suffer again as we did nine years ago.

555
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,559
Thank you, Minister.

556
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,640
It's so considerate of you.

557
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:56,799
By the way,

558
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,759
Lu Ziyi is back.

559
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,559
He's promoted.

560
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:07,240
He will be on that plane to Beiping tomorrow, too.

561
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,839
You know the saying goes.

562
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,480
Catering to others makes you a duke.

563
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,039
Candor turns you into a corpse by the route.

564
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,680
My suggestion is

565
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:19,559
to stop your unrealistic idea.

566
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,680
Peace means everything

567
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,039
to a newly married couple.

568
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,079
Minister,

569
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,079
I get it.

570
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,000
For so many years of cultivation,

571
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,675
I have been more mature.

572
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,670
I can't fail your expectation.

573
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,319
By the way,

574
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm thinking about

575
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,400
inviting Zou Shenghong from Bombing Brigade.

576
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,720
To have fun with his brothers in Hanguang Squadron.

577
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,799
Do you know that he disobeyed the order

578
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,359
to bomb the communists?

579
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,599
A death sentence is very likely.

580
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,519
He has worked for you for years.

581
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,519
Whatever the sentence may be,

582
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,759
he was one of us.

583
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
[Flight 673 to Luoyang, Flight 923 to Beiping]

584
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,519
Captain, all set.

585
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,000
Xuzhi, wait outside the door.

586
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,599
Yes, sir.

587
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:13,759
Comrades.

588
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,839
Minister set up a trick for us

589
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,559
by separating me from Hanguang Squadron.

590
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,480
We need to modify our uprising plan.

591
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,640
What's your suggestion?

592
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,960
I'm thinking

593
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,599
Yanzhou and I

594
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,880
will stick to the plan and fly to Beiping.

595
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,160
This way, they won't suspect us.

596
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,759
And we could protect

597
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,759
the professors and their families.

598
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,640
The original mission is

599
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,160
that I take the squadron to Luoyang by 673.

600
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,920
Then, we'll swap to backup planes

601
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,599
to bomb the target area.

602
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,240
Now, Minister separated Yanzhou and Nianqao from us.

603
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,839
They'll fly to Beiping.

604
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,119
Lu Ziyi will escort you.

605
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,440
I suggest we act accordingly.

606
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,359
Have Yanzhou and Nianqiao

607
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,000
send the professors to Beiping.

608
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,680
We want Minister and Lu Ziyi

609
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
to believe that they have the hostages in their hands.

610
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,599
And we're afraid to take sudden actions.

611
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,559
Wujiaba doesn't have many airplanes.

612
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,200
Only local forces possess aerial defense weapons.

613
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,559
Plane 673 is a B-25 Mitchell.

614
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,559
There are only five seats in the rear.

615
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,319
There won't be other people watching us

616
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,240
apart from the pilot and co-pilot.

617
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,799
And the defense is weak.

618
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,079
That's to say,

619
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,279
we just need to take care of Liu Yaokun and Li Xinye

620
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,440
and take off safely.

621
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,160
Then we can take over.

622
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,920
Liu Yaokun is known to be greedy.

623
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,920
We can take advantage of him.

624
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,160
I will take care of him.

625
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,279
As for Li Xinye...

626
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
After we take off,

627
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,599
we'll take her as a hostage

628
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
and force her to fly to Yan'an.

629
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,160
We must not let her suspect us

630
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,440
before we pull up.

631
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,839
Captain will take Liu Yaokun's position.

632
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:50,519
No problem.

633
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:55,880
You'll pilot 673.

634
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,839
Me?

635
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
I can pilot.

636
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,160
But I need a navigator.

637
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,039
It used to be Zou Shenghong.

638
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:05,839
But now...

639
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,239
He will be your navigator.

640
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,599
Zou Shenghong?

641
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:12,960
But he's in prison.

642
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,280
I'll take care of it.

643
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,079
Carry out the order.

644

we can't get it from the meteorological department.

It's too suspicious.

656

677
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,719
But you're staying here.

678
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,039
As a result,

679
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,360
we must separate you

680
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,960
from our uprising.

681
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,119
Besides, you'll pilot the plane.

682
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,199
You cannot take care of him.

683
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,760
But now that he sends himself in,

684
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:32,480
I will take care of Lu Ziyi and Tang Shijian.

685
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,480
Zhang Qi, you...

686
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,400
Nianqiao.

687
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,599
Please protect Qianying and the professors.

688
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:43,840
And Haitang.

689
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,000
Keep drinking. Enjoy.

690
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,559
Enjoy. Make yourselves at home.

691
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,320
Have more wine.

692
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,519
Here.

693
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,519
Try the dishes.

694
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,239
Please.

695
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,400
Have some more.

696
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,840
Here.

697
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,320
Dad, mom.

698
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,239
Keep eating.

699
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,820
♫ Someone's waiting for you at home. ♫

700
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,760
♫ Homeland is still broken.
Don't know when will you return. ♫

701
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,599
The time is up.

702
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,519
I shall begin.

703
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,239
Mom, have some more.

704
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,760
Quiet, please.

705
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,800
Excuse me.

706
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,719
Welcome to the ceremony.

707
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,280
Here, all close friends and family members

708
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,800
gather together.

709
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,239
We've gone through the wartime,

710
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,800
and the departure.

711
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,440
Fortunately,

712
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,719
we can still witness true love.

713
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,079
Our hero is still young.

714
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,519
The beautiful lady is gorgeous as always.

715
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,719
The lovely couple

716
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,400
is a perfect match like twin stars in the sky.

717
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,679
Now,

718
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,480
let's witness Zhang Qi and Haitang's wedding ceremony.

719
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,000
First of all,

720
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:24,119
let's welcome the chief-witness nominated
by the bridegroom,

721
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,440
Mr. Tang Shizhen to deliver a speech.

722
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,320
Welcome.

723
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,679
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

724
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,119
Great!

725
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,119
Good!

726
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,400
Hello.

727
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,920
I am Tang Shizhen.

728
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,039
Zhang Qi is my student

729
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,599
and my comrade-in-arms.

730
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,239
It's a honor to be the chief-witness.

731
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,159
To witness with you their marriage

732
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,199
after sufferings and departures.

733
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,800
Eventually, they make it to the marriage.

734
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,880
I'm delighted with this outcome.

735
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,280
Zhang Qi and Meng Haitang

736
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,599
is a perfect pair.

737
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,840
They're the most harmonious couple.

738
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,519
Ms. Meng Haitang,

739
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,960
marrying to a pilot,

740
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,559
becoming his wife,

741
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,400
is the sweetest,

742
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,159
and the most torturing thing.

743
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:11,079
Looking up to the sky,

744
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,679
waiting for him to return.

745
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,440
That's the sweetest,

746
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,039
and the most terrifying wait.

747
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,920
The word flying side by side

748
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,320
is an exact metaphor

749
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,719
of the pilot and his spouse.

750
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,599
The pilot flies in the sky,

751
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,400
while his partner's heart drifts with him.

752
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,039
As a result,

753
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,800
a pilot's partner

754
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,400
must be the bravest, smartest,

755
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
the most enviable,

756
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,599
and the most respectful woman.

757
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,039
On behalf of the aviation school,

758
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,880
I pay my respect

759
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,159
to Ms. Meng Haitang,

760
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,400
who will soon be a pilot's wife.

761
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,000
At last,

762
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,920
I have a few words to share with Zhang Qi.

763
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:06,840
Zhang Qi,

764
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:09,840
you're the lighthouse of Hanguang Squadron.

765
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,199
From now on,

766
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:13,599
you have a lighthouse to guide you home.

767
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,280
Right?

768
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:15,519
Right!

769
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,000
I only have one tip for you.

770
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,239
Stick to the right course

771
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,000
and come home on time.

772
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:35,719
Bravo!

773
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,320
Thanks, Minister Tang.

774
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,480
As the couple requested,

775
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,719
we will keep the ceremony simple.

776
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:46,440
Now, the time has come.

777
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,039
The bride and the bridegroom,

778
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,920
please come up on stage and switch your rings.

779
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,000
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
