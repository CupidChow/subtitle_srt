[Episode 38]

4
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,480
Captain?

5
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,599
It's Captain Zhang!

6
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,760
Captain.

7
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,040
You know what I meant.

8
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
Stop dropping bombs.

9
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,599
What did Captain say?

10
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,680
I hear nothing.

11
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,599
He...he's stopping us.

12
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,080
He doesn't want us to drop bombs.

13
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,879
What? No, no.

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,000
Disobeying a military order
is a capital crime.

15
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,439
But he's our captain.

16
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,280
Remember,

17
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,680
do not return until the mission is completed,

18
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,319
or you'll be disciplined.

19
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,240
Bomber, get back to where you were just now.

20
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,639
Poshan,

21
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,080
I found the evidence that they cheated.

22
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,560
That's a treasure.

23
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,000
I must keep it hidden.

24
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,199
Captain, please give the order to drop bombs.

25
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,919
2127, follow the order of Captain Zhang.

26
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,120
Bomber, close the bomb bay.

27
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,159
Chen Ran, you...

28
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
The punishment will be mine to bear alone.

29
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,719
You're just following my orders.

30
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,159
2127, go back.

31
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,639
Sir,

32
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,000
these fighters are probably just passing by.

33
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:59,560
You are all trained and fearless warriors
of the Empire of Japan.

34
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,240
Chinese planes are nothing to be afraid of.

35
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,720
Maybe this plane is going to Mongyu
for reinforcements.

36
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
To prevent it from blocking our main forces,

37
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,079
now we must go in there, contact the main forces,

38
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,439
and report the presence of the plane.

39
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,160
We have 50 minutes to join the main force.

40
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,920
It's only 20 minutes from here to the side road.

41
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,600
Hurry up.

42
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,360
Yes, sir.

43
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,079
Okayama,

44
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,240
your cultural coverage plan has become

45
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,879
a joke for the world once again.

46
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
I told you,

47
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,839
defeating them only requires

48
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,480
the courage and loyalty of our men in uniform.

49
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,120
This is the end

50
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,439
of our flying squad's cooperative mission.

51
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Send your two friends to their doom.

52
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,120
Don't talk to them like women about poetry.

53
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,480
Don't waste our time any more.

54
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,439
Here.

55
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,240
Go.

56
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,399
Nianqiao.

57
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,839
The lab.

58
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,879
Something happened in the lab.

59
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,879
Are you OK?

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm fine.

61
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,839
Watch out.

62
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Stay safe.

63
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,800
OK.

64
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,079
Be quick.

65
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,439
Where's the sun?

66
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,560
Are you kidding me?

67
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,879
Donglai.

68
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,639
Yes.

69
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,839
I need you to take cover in a safe place.

70
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
You can see what's going on in the lab.

71
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,399
Signal me when they get safely into the basement.

72
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,639
I won't drop the bomb until I get your signal.

73
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,000
The signal is three dots and a dash.

74
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,040
Wait for two seconds, then three dots, a dash,

75
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,600
and two dots.

76
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,160
Donglai,

77
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,639
don't be impatient.

78
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,000
Is that clear?

79
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,879
Yes.

80
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,279
Without a weather forecast,

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,839
I can tell from the natural environment here

82
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,199
that the light will be very strong
at five or six tomorrow.

83
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,519
Qi, I'll keep that in mind.

84
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,320
Don't worry.

85
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Why is there no signal?

86
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh, no.

87
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,519
Get up.

88
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,080
They know we're here.

89
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,039
Chinese say never pursue a desperate foe.

90
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,879
It makes perfect sense.

91
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,879
There's an ambush.

92
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,720
We can't do what the enemy wants.

93
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,759
Our most important task is

94
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:38,759
to ensure the success
of main force's reinforcement to Mongyu,

95
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,440
to get in touch with main force,

96
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,960
and then to leave here.

97
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,600
Yes.

98
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,600
Damn.

99
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,519
Go to hell.

100
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,559
Damn it.

101
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Damn.

102
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,759
Damn them!

103
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,230
Where're Ling Wenyue and Meng Haitang?

104
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,519
They must still be here.

105
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,120
Go and search!

106
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,080
Yes.

107
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,600
Contact the main force!

108
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,600
Yes.

109
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,639
Sir, we found something.

110
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,559
There's a basement.

111
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,440
Go down there.

112
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,159
Yes.

113
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,759
Who let you in there?

114
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,799
Damn it.

115
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a door.

116
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,240
It's locked.

117
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,240
It's thick. It's no use shooting it.

118
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,720
A wire has been cut.

119
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
You go down too.

120
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
Yes.

121
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,840
What's the matter?

122
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,399
The wire. Fix it.

123
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,279
I'll go over here.

124
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,039
OK.

125
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,600
Thank god I kept it in reserve.

126
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,200
You wanna go into my wind tunnel?

127
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,039
No way!

128
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,320
Sir, a message from headquarter.

129
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,360
We're 11 minutes away from the main force joining us.

130
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,320
Okayama,

131
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,600
let's get this sorted out as soon as possible, OK?

132
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,519
The wire's fixed, but I can't open the door.

133
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:30,639
You.

134
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,919
Give me back my oil!

135
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,399
My oil.

136
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,960
Damn it.

137
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,639
You go to hell!

138
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,960
Dad, dad!

139
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,679
The sunlight is back!

140
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,039
Last 30 seconds.

141
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:16,480
How you feeling?

142
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,320
Xishan is going to drop the bomb.

143
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
Go, get out of here.

144
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,879
I'll take you with me.

145
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,919
No, I can't leave.

146
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,600
I can't move.

147
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,320
No, you must go.

148
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,799
Dad, listen to me.

149
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,200
It hurts...

150
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,080
Go.

151
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,679
Another Chinese fighter.

152
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,799
Drop the bomb.

153
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,200
B-25.

154
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,480
Be careful.

155
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,399
The target is Hongshi Road.

156
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:05,759
In the battle at Jiangyin,

157
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,720
Hanxun dropped 450-kilogram bombs.

158
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,850
The enemy's aircraft carrier was too large.
Hanxun couldn't descend to the required altitude.

159
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,600
The bombs were not powerful enough.

160
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,399
He dropped bombs at 800 feet,
but the carrier was only slightly damaged.

161
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,759
Hawk III is a chaser which needs
to dive-bomb for maximum effectiveness.

162
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,440
Without any support on the ground,

163
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,840
we can't finish the action.

164
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,519
Captain,

165
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,600
what should we do if this happens?

166
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,720
Dive-bombing below 40 feet

167
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,000
or even 30 feet.

168
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,279
Bomb at the lowest point.

169
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,960
Forty feet?

170
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,840
It's almost to the ground.
How can you pull it up?

171
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,879
To risk our lives?

172
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,960
The country is in such a state
that there is no other way to save it but to die for it.

173
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,599
Dad.

174
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,599
Dad.

175
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,200
Dad, how you feeling?

176
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,039
Son, listen to me.

177
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,960
You need to take Qianying to Fuhua University.

178
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:05,599
OK.

179
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,720
The Chinese character "hua"...

180
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,480
Hua?

181
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,599
There's something in it.

182
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,839
Okay, I got it, dad.

183
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,799
I got it.

184
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,559
Good boy.

185
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:19,920
Dad.

186
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,759
Dad, I'm here.

187
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,799
Dad!

188
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,039
Don't fall asleep!

189
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,440
Talk to me, dad!

190
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,599
Dad!

191
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,720
I haven't taken you back to Hailun City yet.

192
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,400
Dad!

193
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,160
Get up and talk to me, dad.

194
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,599
Dad.

195
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,279
I'm sorry.

196
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,359
Dad.

197
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,920
I haven't taken you back to Hailun City yet.

198
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,960
Sorry.

199
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm so sorry.

200
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,039
It's all my fault.

201
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,240
Whether it were the 51-kilogram bombs of Xishan

202
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,319
or the 55-kilogram bombs of B-25,

203
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,920
it would be very difficult to deal with that road.

204
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,400
Zhang Qi.

205
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,960
Here's a test. What would you do in this case?

206
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,330
A second explosion can be triggered
by mixing phosphoric acid

207
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,039
and saltpeter and burning at high temperatures.

208
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,480
Great, very good.

209
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,480
Dad, you're also proficient in chemistry?

210
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,680
Don't believe me?

211
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,160
Students from Fuhua university know everything.

212
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,000
You think your dad only teaches

213
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
physics and aerodynamics?

214
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,920
Your old man even writes plays!

215
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,240
Zhang Qi, I give you an A plus.

216
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,279
Of all my students,

217
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,519
he resembles me the most.

218
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,880
Good job!

219
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,440
Mr. Zeng,

220
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,599
how would you rate me this time?

221
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,119
Haitang, watch out!

222
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,680
Uncle, are you OK?

223
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,319
I'm OK.

224
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:29,839
Let me take it.

225
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,359
It was Mr. Zeng who built this secret tunnel.

226
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,319
He really should study
in the architecture department.

227
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,000
It's lucky that we've got your blueprints out.

228
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,640
Let's go.

229
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,200
Unfortunately, oracle bone inscriptions
of Wuding was taken away by them.

230
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,000
Where is this? Where am I?

231
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,279
Sir, you dropped your wallet.

232
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,640
Stop.

233
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:48,960
Give me my stuff back.

234
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,880
You thief!

235
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,960
The thief is you.

236
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm taking back our own stuff.

237
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,680
Stop.

238
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,920
Mr. Ling said we'd do whatever it takes to get you back.

239
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,039
I got you back.

240
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,880
But I have to find Haichen and go to Yan'an with him.

241
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,720
There must be lots of battles along the way.

242
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,200
So, I put you back in the ground.

243
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,079
When the enemy is completely driven away,

244
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,680
if I'm still alive,

245
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,839
I'll come back to you

246
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,880
and hand you over to Mr. Ling again.

247
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,920
And by then,

248
00:23:59,039 --> 00:23:59,880
I promise,

249
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,680
you'll be fine.

250
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,920
You won't have to run for your life.

251
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:39,720
No.

252
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,160
I need to make a mark.

253
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,200
Haitang said

254
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,480
that "dong" means winter,

255
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,920
the end of the four seasons, the prelude of spring,

256
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,359
and hope for the future.

257
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,640
[Aviation saves the country]

258
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,359
Minister,

259
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,599
this was given to me

260
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,839
by Professor Kang Lanshan of Fuhua
before Xiao Hong'en died.

261
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,400
It can prove that Lu Ziyi and others

262
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,000
are indeed guilty.

263
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,720
Guilty?

264
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,119
I can't believe

265
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,079
that you've been through
so many matters of life and death

266
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:20,920
but you haven't changed at all.

267
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,240
I remember when you first entered the school,

268
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,759
you defied Instructor Chen

269
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,279
and he wanted to expel you.

270
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,480
I thought you're too good to let you go.

271
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,759
So I told you to apologize.

272
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,759
But you told me

273
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,960
that you didn't care about anything but justice.

274
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,200
Right is right, and wrong is wrong.

275
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,319
From then on,

276
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,519
I knew that it was not easy being your teacher.

277
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,240
At that time,

278
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,000
you overrode all objections to keep me

279
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,680
and take me as your student.

280
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,359
But it's not easy being my student.

281
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,200
You should already know

282
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,839
that bombing Hongshi was my order.

283
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,160
We both have a lot on our minds.

284
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,160
We haven't had a long talk for a long time, right?

285
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,519
Come on, take a walk with me.

286
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,400
The Air Force Officer School

287
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,000
has moved to India.

288
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,039
This place is empty now.

289
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,599
Lu Ziyi will resign from all his duties at the school
and be transferred to Chongqing.

290
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,920
You'll never see him again.

291
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:54,160
It's better to leave room for maneuver.

292
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,279
I have no personal animus against Lu Ziyi.

293
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,440
However, because of him,
national cultural relics were stolen,

294
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,880
pilots such as Poshan died,

295
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,240
and fighter planes were damaged.

296
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,920
It's a disgrace to a soldier

297
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,400
to be associated with such a man.

298
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,000
As the Generalissimo said,

299
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,319
corruption in the Kuomintang army

300
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,400
reached an alarming level.

301
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,559
Lu did something wrong,

302
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,519
and then he put all the blame on his brother and Xu Te.

303
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,559
He was only responsible for bad supervision.

304
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,160
I don't know how many people
in Central Aviation Council

305
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,240
gained benefits from him.

306
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,559
Now they're all helping him smooth things over.

307
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,400
But he can never wipe out what he did.

308
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,599
Zhang Qi,

309
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,680
you've been familiar with history
since you were a kid.

310
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,680
The officialdom of all dynasties
has always been like this.

311
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,599
Even if everything changes,

312
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,519
what's supposed to happen will happen.

313
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,079
The biggest characteristic of a mature man

314
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,759
is to be at ease with everything.

315
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,440
What once seemed bewildering will no longer be so.

316
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,680
This guy will pay for it.

317
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,759
It's only a matter of time.

318
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,160
After all,

319
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,839
someone else will come to kick his ass,

320
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,839
so why should we get our hands dirty?

321
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,759
But if everyone is like Lu Ziyi, who uses power
for personal gain and enriches his own pockets,

322
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,880
when will China become
a fair and prosperous country?

323
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,000
That's why people are looking forward to a new China.

324
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,880
That's enough.

325
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,039
You have to remember who you are.

326
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,759
Don't discuss what you shouldn't mention.

327
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,319
A soldier of our national party

328
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,519
should always remember
to put the interests of our party first

329
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,279
but also be ready to sacrifice himself.

330
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,599
Zhang Qi, I can protect you once,

331
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,799
but can't protect you forever.

332
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,519
You've been talking and acting pro-Communist.

333
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,559
So remember,

334
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,720

and supported the new 22nd Division
to take Mongyu from the wings.

What will they do with Chen Ran?

353
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,720
Chen Ran and Zou Shenghong will be transferred
to the Ninth Bombing Brigade.

to use this light and heat

and to become the backbone
during the revival of nationhood.

496
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,119
Mom used to say

497
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,079
that as long as the four of us were together,

498
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,159
everywhere was home.

499
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,199
It'll be the same in the future.

500
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,800
As long as the five of us are together,

501
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,440
we are at home everywhere.

502
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,159
Haitang is right.

503
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,280
Father.

504
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,360
As long as we keep missing him,

505
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,280
our family will always be there.

506
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,920
Hurry up to dress up our daughter.

507
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,639
Let me have a look.

508
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,280
Come.

509
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,599
My daughter is growing up

510
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,119
and getting married.

511
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,599
Haitang, I'm sorry to make you go through all this.

512
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,039
When we were in Peiping,

513
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,280
your mother and I had been

514
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,599
preparing a large dowry for you.

515
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,320
But then the war broke out,

516
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,360
and our family is now in shambles.

517
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,400
Father, I don't need those.

518
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,239
Although we are poor materially,

519
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,320
we must not be poor spiritually.

520
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:06,880
Dad wrote you a couplet.

521
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,880
One must have a peaceful country
before she can have a harmonious family.

522
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:22,540
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

523
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:30,440
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

524
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:37,890
♫ Shed tears to our sweet love ♫

525
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:46,370
♫ The date of return is yet to come ♫

526
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,540
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

527

♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

528
00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:01,370
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

529
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:08,620
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

530
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:16,420
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

531
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,570
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

532
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:34,270
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫

533
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,520
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

534
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,040
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

535
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:04,340
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

536
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:11,370
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

537
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:19,190
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

538
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:25,540
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

539
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:38,440
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫
