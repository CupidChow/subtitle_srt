[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,880
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,600
[May 1935 to July 1944]

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,480
They were the young soldiers from Anti-Japanese War
in West Yunnan.

5
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,920
Seven thousand people died in the battle of Mount Song.

6
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,799
The youngest was only nine years old.

7
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,080
On that hillside that has been forgotten,

8
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,190
it was still raining, with a gentle breeze.

9
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,080
No one knows that

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,120
history has passed by before,

11
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,960
leaving the spirits of martyrs to nourish

12
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,560
by turning into the trunk of the trees.

13
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,240
His head is burning up.

14
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,360
Someone is coming.

15
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,120
Be on guard!

16
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,800
We are from the 88th Regiment of the 30th Division!

17
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,280
Who is there?

18
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,520
Zhijiang Air Base.

19
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,319
Air base?

20
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,400
Safe.

21
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:15,599
Go.

22
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,240
We are from the Interpreter Training Corps

23
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,840
of the new 38th Division.

24
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,800
This is Company Commander Zheng.

25
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,879
What?

26
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,479
Don't you salute when you see an officer?

27
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,919
- Sir!
- Sir!

28
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,800
Wasn't your regiment attacking Mongyu?

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,639
How about it?

30
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,680
Did you win?

31
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,450
Do we look like we won?

32
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,360
We were ambushed by the Japanese 56th Division.

33
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,759
Three hundred soldiers in total.

34
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,159
Only a few dozen left.

35
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,520
We also got separated from the brigade,

36
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,280
and got into this goddamned Yemang Mountain.

37
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,479
Yemang Mountain.

38
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,080
We can't find the way out.

39
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,080
I heard that

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,870
when General Du and 9,000 men were trapped in here,

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,430
only 1/3 went out in the end.

42
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,680
How can't we go out?

43
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,680
Is there a road on your side?

44
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,560
You know...

45
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,639
the Japanese are heading for Caotang.

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,319
Although they advance slowly,

47
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,519
once Caotang is lost,

48
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,399
the Japanese 56th Division will reinforce Mongyu

49
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,430
from the direction of Hongshi.

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,190
At that time, we will be attacked front and rear.

51
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,079
The Japanese are well aware that

52
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,759
if they lose Mongyu,

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,199
they will be doomed in western Yunnan.

54
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,800
So they will fight tooth and nail to defend.

55
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,800
If we want to keep Mongyu safe,

56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,680
we will have to sacrifice many lives.

57
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,279
So...

58
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,439
the road to Mongyu must be cut off.

59
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,920
To make it impossible for the Japanese to reinforce.

60
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,240
As an aircraft mechanic,

61
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
how do you know that?

62
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,950
Think about how to get out of this Yemang mountain.

63
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,800
Dude.

64
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,800
You are a smart person, I'll tell you the truth.

65
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,040
Your officer, he can't make it.

66
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,639
If you take him,

67
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,600
you will never get out of this mountain

68
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,839
for the rest of your life.

69
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,360
Everybody,

70
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,360
let's rest here!

71
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,800
Take a break.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,160
Slow down.

73
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,319
Slow down.

74
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,959
Are you okay?

75
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,839
I'll help you get some water to cool down.

76
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,680
Be careful.

77
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,920
Rao Jirong, calm down!

78
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,839
Do it!

79
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,120
All of you!

80
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,399
Let's die together!

81
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,639
Rao Jirong!

82
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,360
Put the knife down!

83
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,560
I am not Rao Jirong!

84
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
You think I'm a burden and want me to die?

85
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,560
Okay!

86
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,800
But I have to make it clear!

87
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,279
I am Wang Junyan!

88
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,630
What have you done to him?

89
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,480
You carried him all the way.

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,519
You gave him water and food.

91
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,439
Isn't that righteous enough?

92
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,759
Put the knife down.

93
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,680
Let's have a talk.

94
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,519
Yes, it was a misunderstanding.

95
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,399
Come on!

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We're soldiers!

97
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,879
Then we'll die together!

98
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,879
Wait a minute!

99
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:18,959
You three.

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Get out of here!

101
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,759
They are all your comrades in arms.

102
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,240
They carried you so far along the way.

103
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
You want them to die now?

104
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,519
Please ask them.

105
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,160
Ask him what he wants.

106
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,519
If it didn't happen that I woke up,

107
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,480
I have taken a shot here!

108
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,040
Why don't you let them shoot me here?

109
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,519
Are you afraid...

110
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,800
Are you afraid to look at me in the eye?

111
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,199
He came down from the Battle of Mount Song.

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,720
That fight was so bad.

113
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,879
Something is wrong with his head!

114
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,040
They want to shoot me here.

115
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,800
Later.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,070
What will people think when they see my corpse?

117
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
A deserter!

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,510
I am a deserter who forgot my family name!

119
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,399
If you stay,

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,399
we'll die together!

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,959
Wait a minute!

122
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,600
Department of Chinese at Fuhua.

123
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,240
Student of 1931, Wang Junyan!

124
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,639
I am Mr. Chen.

125
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,319
Chen Dairong!

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,959
I taught you, do you remember?

127
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,560
Do you remember the philosophy and reality

128
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,510
in Dream of the Red Chamber?

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,200
Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen.

130
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,759
Yanjun.

131
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,039
Put the grenade away.

132
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,960
Tell me if you have any complaints, okay?

133
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,919
Mr. Chen.

134
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,679
You'd better go.

135
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,879
I don't want to live anymore.

136
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,159
I am not Wang Junyan.

137
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,519
I, I am Rao Jirong.

138
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,080
Please tell my parents.

139
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,879
Tell them.

140
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,120
That their son is unfilial.

141
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,039
Why did you change your name?

142
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:31,480
I volunteered for the military.

143
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,679
Once I got enrolled,

144
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,910
it was Rao Jirong who was registered on the roster.

145
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,240
At first I thought I had made a mistake.

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
Not until later,

147
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,790
I knew that we were the substitution of some rich kids.

148
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,720
A third of soldiers from 88th regiment are like this.

149
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,080
But if you die here,

150
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,390
your parents will never know what you died for.

151
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,720
And no one will ever know if you are a deserter or not.

152
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Are you willing to die like this for no reason?

153
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,120
Leave him to me.

154
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,600
I'll take him.

155
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,720
We're good.

156
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,879
Good.

157
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,799
You follow him.

158
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,559
You go with your teacher!

159
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,120
Fuhua Physics Department, student of 1917.

160
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,799
Zhang Qi.

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,550
Student of 1919 of the Chinese Department at Fuhua.

162
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Zeng Nianqiao.

163
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,039
They are all your seniors.

164
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,200
Now you believe us, right?

165
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,720
Junyan?

166
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,279
Nobody move!

167
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,240
Take your people away!

168
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
Sir, can we have our guns back?

169
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,679
Take your people away!

170
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,559
That's an order!

171
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,320
Go!

172
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,159
Good! You can have the gun!

173
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,080
Let's go!

174
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,440
Nianqiao? Nianqiao!

175
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:45,759
Nianqiao?

176
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,360
Nianqiao?

177
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,280
[Call for Intellectual Youth to Join the Army]

178
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,440
Now.

179
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,240
The youth corp is trying to recruit in the city.

180
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,799
In these three months,

181
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,279
there are hundreds of students from our school

182
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,240
who have joined the army.

183
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,600
There are also professors who have signed up.

184
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,960
You are the dean of the National Academy
of Fuhua University.

185
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,440
What do you think about this matter?

186
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,440
At this moment in time,

187
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,919
no one can stay out of it.

188
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,679
It is everyone' duty to join the military

189
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,080
and defend the country.

190
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,639
Yes, having said that,

191
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
but these children are still young.

192
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,159
They are our students.

193
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,790
I feel heartbroken for them.

194
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,039
I feel that too.

195
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:02,720
Uncle Ling?

196
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,480
Uncle Ling!

197
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,600
Uncle.

198
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,030
Uncle Ling, I've been looking for you everywhere.

199
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,320
Didn't you go to the Yunnan-Burma Highway
for an interview?

200
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,399
How did you get back?

201
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,000
Why do you look for him...

202
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,639
What are you doing?

203
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,600
Didn't I pay you?

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,559
I came back from the front line

205
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,759
and you want money from me?

206
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
How can you beat him?

207
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,600
Beat him up! Beat him up!

208
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,759
Don't rush!

209
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,120
How can you beat him?

210
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,030
Don't you have any families?

211
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:34,840
Don't you have any soul!

212
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,480
Shut up!

213
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,440
Who are you?

214
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,279
Sir, let's talk about it.

215
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,639
This is a professor from Fuhua University.

216
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,360
Professor?

217
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes.

218
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,399
That's why I beat him.

219
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,759
How can you beat him?

220
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,919
Get out of the way!

221
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,120
Get out of the way!

222
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,600
Mr. Ling, are you okay?

223
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,120
Zhenzhu.

224
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,840
They just beat people up here.

225
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,240
What are you doing? Why are you beating people up?

226
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,720
Who are you?

227
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,480
This is Supervisor Bai's daughter.

228
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:15,320
Tell your people to get the hell out of here, now!

229
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,039
Go!

230
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,080
Move it!

231
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,039
How can they just beat people up?

232
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,120
Miss Bai, which unit is this?

233
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,480
What a jerk!

234
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,279
Mr. Ling, are you all right?

235
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,679
Ling?

236
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,559
Are you okay?

237
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,799
Lanshan, I just feel a little dizzy.

238
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,399
Take him to the hospital.

239
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,639
There is blood.

240
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,279
Go.

241
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:36,919
Are you okay?

242
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,639
I'm fine.

243
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,679
Did any student get injured?

244
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,320
Hurry up!

245
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,879
Go!

246
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,320
Gao Lin, escort Mr. Ling to the hospital.

247
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,270
Go check it out.

248
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,039
Go.

249
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,440
What is going on?

250
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,840
Please take me to find out which unit they are from.

251
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm going to get their officer.

252
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,879
Zeng Nianqiao of the Hanguang Squadron.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,159
How come you have it?

254
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,240
I...

255
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,399
I know all the things.

256
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,559
Well done.

257
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,120
It is a blessing since you escaped.

258
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,080
The Japanese are so shameless!

259
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,200
To save the lives of them two,

260
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,399
you need to stop publishing

261
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,679
the Study on the Shang Dynasty Calendar,

262
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,480
and go to the meeting in western Yunnan.

263
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,840
In that case,

264
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,200
this letter was written by Okayama Shinichi.

265
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,799
How did you meet him?

266
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,759
How are you going to bring him the letter?

267
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,919
Well, about this.

268
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,440
It's really a long story.

269
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,670
But I think the most important thing now

270
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,200
is to save Nianqiao out.

271
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,559
What are you talking about?

272
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
How about Zhang Qi?

273
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,360
Is he not important?

274
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,790
Well, uncle, that's not what I meant.

275
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,639
What about your sister Haitang?

276
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,320
We have lost contact with Zhang Qi for three years.

277
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,919
What...

278
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,080
Hongen.

279
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,480
Zhang Qi and Zeng Nianqiao are in the hands of
the Japanese.

280
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,000
Why did them let you out?

281
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,399
How should I know?

282
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,000
I wish I could know.

283
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,879
Well, uncle.

284
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,519
You tell us.

285
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,639
What should I do now?

286
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,080
How do I know what to do?

287
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,039
Wait.

288
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,030
The Japanese had captured you, released you,

289
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,480
and asked you to deliver this letter?

290
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,080
They asked you to send it to Professor Ling, right?

291
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,559
Their target is Professor Ling.

292
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,879
Also, to prevent the publication of

293
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,920
the Study on the Shang Dynasty Calendar.

294
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,720
First of all.

295
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,400
We can't let Professor Ling and Haitang
know about this.

296
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,000
And...Hongen.

297
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,750
Take me to western Yunnan and we'll leave tomorrow.

298
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,720
What problems can you solve then?

299
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,960
I need to go there first.

300
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,559
A way will surely be figured out.

301
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,960
I have to get these two kids out first no matter what.

302
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,799
Dad.

303
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,920
Why haven't you slept yet?

304
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,359
What's going on?

305
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,039
Nothing.

306
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,759
I came to...

307
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,559
talk to you.

308
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,359
- Sit.
- Sit.

309
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Tea?

310
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,000
Haitang.

311
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,119
In these years,

312
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,640
I always owed you an apology.

313
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,759
At that time,

314
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,160
I shouldn't have changed your college application.

315
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,160
Although you chose the normal school afterwards.

316
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,759
I was very relieved in my heart.

317
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,359
But still, I have to tell you that

318
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,920
in the future, never fulfill the wishes of anyone

319
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,400
by compromising yourself.

320
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,550
It was my wish to go to a normal school after all of this.

321
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,599
I want to be like you.

322
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,640
To be a teacher who will feel proud of himself.

323
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,079
So you don't have to think that way.

324
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,440
I didn't change my mind for someone else.

325
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,920
This is my wish.

326
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,440
Dad, do you know that?

327
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,880
When I was a kid,

328
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,750
I always felt that I have empowered myself

329
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,839
as long as it was against you and mom.

330
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,920
After I've grown up,

331
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,920
I realize that it's the love from you and mom

332
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,480
that allows me to be a naughty girl.

333
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,640
You and mom are the most loving and caring people
in the world.

334
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,480
My little girl has grown up.

335
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,119
Time flies so fast.

336
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,839
I hate to say this.

337
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,079
But I don't want you to grow up.

338
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,680
How nice it would be to still be a child.

339
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,759
Haitang.

340
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,160
No matter how big you grow,

341
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,759
you're the apple of my eye.

342
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,960
Yes, I know.

343
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,319
You are the eldest daughter in the family.

344
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,839
Suppose that...

345
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,559
I mean what if...

346
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,550
I can't be with you one day.

347
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:40,480
Take good care of your mom and your brother.

348
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,599
Why do you suddenly say that?

349
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,559
It just pops into my head.

350
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,000
Your mother...

351
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,160
married to me for over thirty years.

352
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,000
She has given her body and soul to this family.

353
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,960
Though she can't read or write,

354
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,599
she understands people and she is a sensible person.

355
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,119
She loves you and your little brother.

356
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,480
She loves me too.

357
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,480
She is the one who takes care of our family.

358
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:28,110
So I put my heart into Fuhua without any worries.

359
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,680
In fact,

360
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,680
I feel really sorry for your mother.

361
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,559
Dad, something is wrong with you.

362
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,160
What is going on?

363
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,759
Nothing.

364
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,519
If something is wrong,

365
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,920
it's just that I am getting old.

366
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,519
I am a nagger now.

367
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:54,759
By the way.

368
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,000
Tomorrow, I have to go out.

369
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,200
I'll be back in a few days.

370
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:02,720
That's it.

371
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,079
Remember.

372
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,279
Take good care of Uncle Ling.

373
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,519
Due to his temper,

374
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,200
he had a conflict with a group of soldiers
this morning.

375
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,640
And he was beaten up.

376
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,079
I'll go to see him.

377
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,519
It's quite late.

378
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,880
He is asleep.

379
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,720
You can see him tomorrow.

380
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,480
Okay.

381
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,200
I should go.

382
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,400
Give me a hug.

383
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,599
Go to bed.

384
00:22:59,279 --> 00:22:59,799
Good night.

385
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,839
Dad, what's wrong with you?

386
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,640
I'm getting old.

387
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,200
I got sentimental.

388
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,039
Go to bed.

389
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,240
Meng Wuran.

390
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,759
Something isn't right.

391
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,440
Having been married to you for thirty years,

392
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,599
you've never been in the kitchen before,

393
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,640
or done any work there.

394
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,599
Something must be wrong with you.

395
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
You want to hide it from me.

396
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,519
It must be a big deal.

397
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,559
At the beginning,

398
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,680
we were matchmaked by our parents.

399
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,310
I am uneducated and illiterate.

400
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,270
I know you feel aggrieved to marry me.

401
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,880
And you don't like to talk to me.

402
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,640
Even if you talk, you talk angrily.

403
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,680
But I know you are a good person.

404
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,559
I know you have me in your heart

405
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,759
and I have you in my heart.

406
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,070
Without you, there would be no complete home.

407
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,920
Our family can not do without anyone.

408
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,480
Aiju.

409
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,599
You are the backbone of our family.

410
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,400
Here, have some noodles.

411
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,240
No, I won't eat.

412
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm sure it's cooked.

413
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
Meng, are you hiding something from me?

414
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,039
Tell me the truth!

415
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,440
If I tell you, don't get excited.

416
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,400
Don't let Haitang know.

417
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,680
Zhang Qi and Nianqiao...

418
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
they were captured by the Japanese.

419
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,839
What?

420
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,079
Keep your voice down.

421
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,680
They are safe now.

422
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,310
The Japanese sent someone over to deliver the letter.

423
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,550
They want Professor Ling to negotiate with them.

424
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,200
Don't you know Ling Wenyue?

425
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,070
He's a man who has never grovel to anyone in his life.

426
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,119
If he goes to negotiate,

427
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,640
they will all die.

428
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,799
So what you're saying is that you want to go?

429
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,759
You go and you will solve it?

430
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,960
The thing is...

431
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,640
Haitang waited for Zhang Qi for three years.

432
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,720
If something happens to Zhang Qi,

433
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,160
what about Haitang?

434
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,440
And.

435
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,830
Now I don't know where Professor Zeng is.

436
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,880
If something happens to Nianqiao,

437
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,030
how can I explain to Professor Zeng when I meet him?

438
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,599
The most important part is Ling Wenyue.

439
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,359
The academic research of

440
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,960
the Study on the Shang Dynasty Calendar.

441
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,830
Now he is the only one who can finish it.

442
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,720
He is like a national treasure.

443
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,550
I can't let anything go wrong with him!

444
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,160
No way!

445
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
I understand what you are saying!

446
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,960
But I don't want you to go!

447
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,319
You are the backbone of our family.

448
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,510
If anything happens to you, our family will be apart.

449
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,960
No, it can't be.

450
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,599
You are a sensible person.

451
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,160
I am the only one who is best suited to go at this time.

452
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
So many things have happened over the years,

453
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,319
big or small.

454
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:31,519
And I survived every single time.

455
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Safe and sound.

456
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,680
Isn't it?

457
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,759
You have to trust me.

458
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,160
I will think of a way to bring them back safe.

459
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,960
I don't believe it!

460
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,880
You must trust me.

461
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,920
I don't believe it!

462
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,519
But...

463
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,680
But I want you to...

464
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,590
come home with them safely.

465
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:04,880
I will.

466
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,720
I definitely will.

467
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
I definitely will.

468
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,559
I will.

469
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,240
Trust me.

470
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,759
Trust me, okay?

471
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,720
Trust me.

472
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,759
Slow down.

473
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,880
Slow down.

474
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,480
Nianqiao?

475
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,440
Nianqiao.

476
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,359
Take a break.

477
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:18,759
Take a break.

478
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,440
Junyan's wounds are rotting.

479
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,759
Without any food or medicine.

480
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,440
They will die if we can't get out of here.

481
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,240
It's not sunny days these days.

482
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,359
The position of Polaris is not observed.

483
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,750
But last night I saw the Cassiopeia constellation.

484
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,440
The position of Polaris can be inferred in reverse.

485
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,880
If I'm not mistaken,

486
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,839
if we are always in this direction,

487
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,039
we can get out of the Yemang mountain.

488
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,400
I am afraid that

489
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,590
Nianqiao and Junyan can't wait for that time.

490
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,119
Someone is coming.

491
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,160
Watch them.

492
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,640
I'll go over and take a look.

493
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:07,720
Okay.

494
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,799
Be careful.

495
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,920
See that tree fort?

496
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,030
It should be left by the first expeditionary force.

497
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,200
Let's use it.

498
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,160
To fight them by ambush.

499
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:01,960
I object.

500
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,039
The number of Japanese troops

501
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:06,960
is twice as much as we do.

502
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,440
And they all have guns.

503
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,759
We only have two guns.

504
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,039
And two wounded soldiers like me.

505
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,599
We are not their match.

506
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,839
I think the best way

507
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,030
is don't go head-to-head with them.

508
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,519
The purpose of this action

509
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,359
is not to destroy the Japanese army.

510
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,279
Instead, we want the medical kit.

511
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,480
I'll set up the combat mission.

512
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,440
Captain!

513
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,079
It's not worth it!

514
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,880
My purpose is to bring you out of here alive.

515
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,119
As for whether it's worth it,

516
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,839
I call the shots.

517
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,640
Zhang Qi, you give the order.

518
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,880
Okay.

519
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,000
Then let's start the game of the flying swings.

520
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,839
I'll be the inducer.

521
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,160
Our plane crashed.

522
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,799
We need help.

523
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,039
My companion is still on board.

524
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,559
Can you help us?

525
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,359
Capturing the Chinese pilot is a big credit.

526
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,920
There may be a map on the plane, go check it out.

527
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:56,880
Mr. Chen.

528
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,079
Your mission is to take out the leader,

529
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,360
also draw their fire.

530
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,079
There is cement inside the tree fort.

531
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,760
It can temporarily stop the bullets.

532
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,150
Once you're in the crossfire, it's hard to shoot.

533
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,440
So...

534
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,199
there is only one chance.

535
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,239
I can do it.

536
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:23,960
Make sure to hit it right.

537
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,760
To hit it right!

538
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,239
Kill him!

539
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,400
The real killers...

540
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,599
ambush here...

541
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,400
ambush from both sides.

542
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,679
Wang Junyan, you are wounded.

543
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Can you do it?

544
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,960
Are you really just a mechanic?

545
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,119
He is the captain of the Hanguang Squadron.

546
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,480
Where is the medic?

547
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,679
The direction of eight o'clock!

548
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,480
The wound is open.

549
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,639
Mr. Zeng!

550
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,599
Do you want to go to see Captain Zhang?

551
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,119
Nianqiao! Nianqiao!

552
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,199
Nianqiao!

553
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,079
Mr. Zeng!

554
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,320
Nianqiao?

555
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:49,719
Nianqiao?

556
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,039
Nianqiao?

557
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,400
Father.

558
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,480
Father.

559
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:17,150
I will take Poshan and you back to Hailun town
to see my mother.

560
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,400
Nianqiao, take your medicine.

561
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,190
Here, open your mouth and take the medicine.

562
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,159
Good.

563
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,480
Okay, it's okay.

564
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,760
Dad is here.

565
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,239
Dad is here.

566
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,400
It's okay.

567
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,719
It's okay.

568
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:32,400
Mr. Zeng.

569
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,960
It's okay.

570
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,679
Three years.

571
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,400
I thought...

572
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,599
You think I'm dead?

573
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,599
It's good to see you.

574
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,400
Really good.

575
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,760
I won't die easily.

576
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,199
Mr. Okayama.

577
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,679
My Yunnan-Burma operations group

578
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,960
is to guard this western Yunnan highway

579
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,519
for the 56th Division of the Imperial Army.

580
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,320
To complement your cultural coverage plan,

581
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,710
we've been here for three days.

582
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,630
Are you sure Ling Wenyue can come?

583
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,559
Within seven days,

584
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,679
if your plan doesn't work,

585
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,510
then my group will go to the Yunnan-Burma Highway,

586
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,400
accomplish military missions.

587
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,840
Mr. Okayama.

588
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,320
The plan to subvert the soul of the Chinese people

589
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,000
has spent a lot of funds,

590
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,280
but it's of no avail.

591
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,840
Ling Wenyue will come for sure.

592
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:25,230
Please promise to cooperate with me in this play.

593
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,920
I'm a military man.

594
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,320
I can only guarantee the death of the enemy.

595
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,639
They are not guaranteed to live.

596
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,679
Zhang Qi led the right way.

597
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,480
This is the edge of the southeast corner
of Yemang Mountain.

598
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,800
A little further ahead is the road.

599
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:56,719
Mr. Zeng.

600
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,030
Aren't you in some kind of flight lab?

601
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,760
Why did you come to Yemang Mountain?

602
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,639
This forest is rich in tung trees.

603
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:05,800
I come several times a year!

604
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,159
Let me quiz you.

605
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,880
What can the tung tree be used for?

606
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,519
The tung tree?

607
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:17,280
You have no idea.

608
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,760
You have no idea.

609
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,360
Tung oil.

610
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:21,199
Shut up.

611
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,199
Don't you laugh.

612
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,519
It is tung oil.

613
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,760
That's a good stuff.

614
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,960
In critical times,

615
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,280
it can replace fuel.

616
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,440
I'm experimenting with it right now.

617
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,840
I want to see that

618
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,400
how would the mono-alkyl ester biodiesel

619
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:38,150
work in a warplane.

620
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,360
Father, that would be great.

621
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,480
What are you doing here?

622
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:48,880
Why would it be?

623
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,239
It's because of you.

624
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:51,440
Me?
