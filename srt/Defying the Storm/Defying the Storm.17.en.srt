[Episode 17]

4
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,280
We should find a way to get him a quilt.

5
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:40,800
I gave him back his quilt, but he didn't want it.

6
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,000
He's still out looking for firewood for us
on such a cold day.

7
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:48,057
Everyone, come on.

8
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Let's go to get some firewood for Mr. Fu.

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,599
- Okay?
- Yes.

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,400
Go.

11
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
- Donglai.
- Slow down.

12
00:01:58,114 --> 00:01:58,870
Go with us.

13
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,199
Mr. Fu.

14
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,479
Mr. Fu.

15
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,039
Mr. Fu.

16
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,280
Mr. Fu.

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,639
Why are you all here?

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,360
We're here to collect firewood for you.

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
Good.

20
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:32,680
Mr. Fu.

21
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,439
Go.

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,430
Come on.

23
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:45,750
The firewood in the south in winter
is too wet to kindle.

24
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,919
Who'd buy that?

25
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,857
Mr. Fu is still collecting firewood.

26
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,120
He has no common sense.

27
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,771
You have common sense?

28
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,030
If you hadn't pissed off
several bandits for your appetite,

29
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,940
Haitang and Yuanyin wouldn't
have no travel expenses,

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,120
and Mr. Fu wouldn't have to make
straw sandals and gather firewood for money.

31
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,960
Hey, kid, do you believe I'll rip your lip off?

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,680
Donglai.

33
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,599
Come on.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Tie the wood for me.

35
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm tired.

36
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,759
Quick, Donglai.

37
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,000
There's a rope.

38
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,439
Donglai.

39
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,400
Among us,

40
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,800
you're the strongest and smartest.

41
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:35,470
The way to Kunming is still long.

42
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:39,000
But having you with us makes me feel at ease.

43
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,319
I can't recite any poems.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,171
I don't deserve to go with you.

45
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,100
It doesn't matter that you can't recite poems.

46
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,480
It matters if you can protect others like a man.

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,719
Okay.

48
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,879
It's out.

49
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,759
Once again.

50
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,600
The wood is too wet.

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
I'll go to get some dry wood in the town.

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,839
Let me.

53
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,914
I'm good at begging for things.

54
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:11,070
You damn thief!

55
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,160
Put down my quilt.

56
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,839
Honey, go.

57
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,680
We got wood.

58
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
We got dry wood.

59
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,199
Make a fire.

60
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,399
Donglai, what's wrong with you?

61
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,160
You're wounded?

62
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,759
Make a fire.

63
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,240
I'm okay.

64
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,000
Mr. Fu, I begged for a quilt for you.

65
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,040
Take it.

66
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,839
Okay.

67
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,600
Donglai.

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,920
Why is your leg hurt?

69
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,680
It's fine.

70
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,639
By accident.
- No.

71
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,680
It's okay.

72
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,439
Let me check it.

73
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,600
The wound is ugly. Stop.

74
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,800
No.

75
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,160
Don't move.

76
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,950
Your leg was hurt by a steel trap.

77
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,879
A steel trap?

78
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,360
Miss Meng, fetch the drug box.

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,439
Miss Xu, take the kids to make a fire.

80
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,199
Okay.

81
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,480
Class, let's go to make a fire.

82
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,399
Okay.

83
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,360
Go.

84
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,800
It's finally on.

85
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,628
It might not be used to treat the wound.

86
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,430
It can only stop your bleeding.

87
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,240
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

88
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,342
Donglai.

89
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:17,314
Tell me the truth.

90
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,428
Why did you get hurt?

91
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,439
It was an accident.

92
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:25,480
When it rains, it pours.

93
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
You're the smartest usually.

94
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,800
Why did you step into a steel trap?

95
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,920
And where did you get this quilt?

96
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,319
I begged for it.

97
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,879
What?

98
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,959
Do you think it's dirty?

99
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,199
Fine. I'll burn it.

100
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I trust you, of course.

101
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,519
How would I not like it?

102
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,160
Donglai.

103
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,079
What a nice quilt.

104
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,680
Thank you.

105
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,000
It's so thick.

106
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I can sleep well tonight.

107
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,179
[Sun]

108
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
Miss Meng and Miss Xu,

109
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,440
keep cooking the porridge.

110
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,440
I'm going to buy some cough medicine in the town.

111
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,159
Okay.

112
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,120
Be careful, Mr. Fu.

113
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,240
Mr. Fu is back.

114
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:24,200
Does it still hurt?

115
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,639
No.

116
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,360
I've led a wandering life for years.

117
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,279
It's nothing.

118
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,080
Come on, years?

119
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
How old are you?

120
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,799
16.

121
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,840
You're still a kid.

122
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,457
I promised I'd make a storytelling for you last time.

123
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,285
Do you want to listen to it today?

124
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:48,971
Mr. Fu, I didn't expect you to remember it.

125
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,840
I'm a man of my word.

126
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,720
Go.

127
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,120
During the Spring and Autumn Period,

128
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,200
The State of Chu wants to attack the State of Song.

129
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:10,228
Mozi is entrusted by
the students of the State of Song

130
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,342
to persuade Emperor Chu not to attack them.

131
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:15,670
When Mozi meets Emperor Chu, he says,

132
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,320
Your Majesty,

133
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,559
I know someone

134
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,080
who always thinks his things are not good.

135
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:28,342
He even wants to rob someone's nasty shirt.

136
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,000
Do you think there's something wrong with him?

137
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,759
Emperor Chu thinks so after he heard that.

138
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,685
Then, Mozi says to Emperor Chu,

139
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:43,790
the land of the State of Chu is fertile.

140
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,400
It's a big country abounding in natural resources.

141
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,879
There are so many rhinoceros and elks.

142
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,279
The Yangtze River and the Han River
have the most fish in the world.

143
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,840
While the State of Song is weak and poor.

144
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,039
Emperor Chu wants to attack the State of Song.

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Aren't you the same as the guy I just mentioned?

146
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,320
Mr. Fu, that's Mo Zi and Gong Shu you told us about?

147
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,960
The Japanese occupied our land.

148
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,679
They're thieves.

149
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,720
Sir, you told us to choose death before being a thief.

150
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,120
Now we're making a precarious living,

151
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,159
but we have to plan for the long term.

152
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,039
You're just teenagers.

153
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:30,840
You should prepare for the future.

154
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,910
Study when you have to.

155
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,120
What's the use?

156
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,159
What you just recited can't be wood or food.

157
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,960
Our country was damaged by war.

158
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,399
But the war will end.

159
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,080
We need someone to rebuild our country.

160
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,480
Therefore, we should study hard.

161
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,279
If you can get our civilization memorized,

162
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,030
it'll be your wealth all your life.

163
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:07,200
There's so much knowledge in the books.

164
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,390
Books are good for your soul.

165
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:11,630
They can make you smart, reasonable

166
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,960
and a man of indomitable spirit.

167
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,200
Neither study nor labor,

168
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,399
but steal and rob.

169
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Is this what a man does?

170
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,960
I see.

171
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:28,628
Turns out you're working together to scold me.

172
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:31,200
I don't mean that.

173
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,870
Don't move, Mr. Fu.

174
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,120
I stole that quilt.

175
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,759
Do you want it?

176
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:37,840
You stole it?

177
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,600
Stole?

178
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,720
If it's stolen, I won't want it.

179
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:47,750
Gentlemen understand what is moral,

180
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,200
Villains value what is profitable.

181
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:52,514
We must know the difference
between moral and profit.

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,790
Fine. You're all gentlemen.

183
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,857
I'm the only villain.

184
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,279
Donglai.

185
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,440
I won't serve you.

186
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,480
Let's go our separate ways.

187
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,799
I don't mean you're a villain.

188
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,159
Donglai.

189
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,799
Li Donglai.

190
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,559
Stop chasing.

191
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,200
It's almost dark. I'm heading out to check.

192
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,840
Sir.

193
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,960
Bu, what happened?

194
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
Sir, I'm too scared to go to sleep.

195
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,759
I dreamed that my parents
were dead when I fell asleep.

196
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,919
It's okay.

197
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,840
Good boy.

198
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,679
Don't cry, Bu.

199
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,039
Okay.

200
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,000
Here, Bu.

201
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,639
Here. Let me get you something delicious.

202
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,279
Here you are.

203
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,240
Taste it. Is it sweet?

204
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,320
Yeah.

205
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,200
Don't cry, Bu.

206
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,799
Let's go to sleep.

207
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,480
Come on.

208
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,000
Here.

209
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,039
Yuanyin.

210
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,559
Hurry up. There's a fire!

211
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,159
Mr. Fu.

212
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:52,960
Kids.

213
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,279
Hurry.

214
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:54,799
Class.

215
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,559
- Mr. Fu.
- There's a fire!

216
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,320
Students, get up.

217
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,440
- Fire!
- Class.

218
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,440
- Quick.
- Wake up.

219
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,679
Wake up, everyone.

220
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,879
Go!

221
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,480
Wake up!

222
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,039
Fire!

223
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,960
Run!

224
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,000
Run to the gate.

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,519
Go!

226
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,559
Oh no!

227
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,759
Hurry!

228
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,360
Go!

229
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,159
Be careful, kids.

230
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:39,960
Run!

231
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,080
Be careful.

232
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,399
Are you okay?

233
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,320
Get up.

234
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,879
Quick.

235
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,220
- Let me see.
- Are you okay?

236
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,630
I'm fine.

237
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,279
Haitang.

238
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,080
Is everyone here?

239
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,279
One is missing.

240
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,559
One is missing?

241
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,720
Huang Shixing.

242
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,559
Huang Shixing is inside.

243
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,519
He's inside.

244
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,279
I'm going in there.

245
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,559
You two take care of the kids.

246
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,799
Stay away from the fire.

247
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,679
It's dangerous, Mr. Fu.

248
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,840
Sir, dangerous.

249
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,000
It's okay.

250
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,359
Huang Shixing.

251
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,440
Donglai.

252
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,119
What... what happened?

253
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,839
Donglai.

254
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,559
Where's Mr. Fu?

255
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,319
He's saving Huang Shixing inside.

256
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,160
I'm going to save him.

257
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,319
I'll go with you.

258
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,599
Haitang, it's too dangerous.

259
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,640
No, you take care of the kids.

260
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,880
Sir.

261
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,960
Don't move, kids.

262
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,799
Mr. Fu, are you okay?

263
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:39,960
How are you?

264
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,580
Wake up, Mr. Fu.

265
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,960
Sir.

266
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,640
Sir.

267
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,200
Sir.

268
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,000
Sir.

269
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,880
Mr. Fu.

270
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,880
You're all fine?

271
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,720
Mr. Fu.

272
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,079
Mr. Fu, we're all here.

273
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
- Sir.
- Sir, we're all here.

274
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,680
Sir, we're all fine.

275
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,759
It's all my fault.

276
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,420
I shouldn't have stolen someone's quilt,

277
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,860
certainly not leaving you.

278
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,400
Donglai.

279
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,440
It's an accident.

280
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,480
It's not your fault.

281
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,400
Sir.

282
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,119
You're a good boy.

283
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,319
Be a good man from now on.

284
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,119
Yes.

285
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,079
Sir.

286
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,200
Sir, don't leave me.

287
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,039
Miss Meng...

288
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,839
Mr. Fu.

289
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,079
Miss Meng.

290
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,839
Please...

291
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,000
take my students...

292
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,400
and Bu...

293
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,279
to Kunming...

294
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,920
to Kunhua...

295
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,799
to Kunhua Middle School.

296
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,880
We promised to meet there.

297
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Promise me.

298
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,519
Mr. Fu.

299
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,839
Trust me. I'll do it well.

300
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,119
Mr. Fu, please don't die.

301
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,839
Good boy, Bu.

302
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,559
Mr. Fu.

303
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,079
Sir.

304
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,160
- Sir.
- Mr. Fu.

305
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,200
Sir.

306
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,440
Sir.

307
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,599
Sir.

308
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,960
- Sir.
- Mr. Fu.

309
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,480
- Sir.
- Mr. Fu.

310
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,119
- Sir.
- Mr. Fu.

311
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,359
- Sir.
- Mr. Fu.

312
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,880
Sir.

313
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,599
Sir.

314
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,480
Sir.

315
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,119
Sir.

316
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:13,960
What happened?

317
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,400
Why did such a good man...

318
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm here to return the ring.

319
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,559
This gentleman got me yesterday.

320
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,000
He said his student stole my quilt.

321
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,160
He had no money.

322
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,160
So he paid with this ring.

323

he said I was his student?

328
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,640
Yes.

329
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,519
He said you stole the quilt

330
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,000
because you wanted him to keep out the chill.

331
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,279

Everyone, get up.

376
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,960
I have something to tell you.

377
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,680
From this day on,

378
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,720
I'll take over Mr. Fu's job

379
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,519
of taking you all the way to your teacher

380
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
in Kunhua Middle School.

381
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,240
Now counting the things to see what's left.

382
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,799
A geography book is the one thing left to me.

383
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,400
Nothing else.

384
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,880
How to take the class?

385
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,799
Me too.

386
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,079
And me.

387
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,680
All of the books and the rice
were burned out in the fire.

388
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,519
We've got so many people. We have no money left.

389
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,799
How to go to Kunming?

390
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,720
Did you learn the School Song?

391
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,279
Yes.

392
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,085
Alright. There's knowledge
of history and geography in it.

393
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:06,440
I know the Chinese Ancient Prose.

394
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Yuanyin, you teach math.

395
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,599
You know what, we'll teach the class along the way

396
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:12,960
until we get to Kunming.

397
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,599
As for money,

398
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,960
there's always a way.

399
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,640
I got you. You won't starve.

400
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,839
Don't worry.

401
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,960
I won't let Mr. Fu down again.

402
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,079
I thought there was a town ahead.

403
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,680
Let's go to see if we can get
some food there before we leave.

404
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,480
Say goodbye to Mr. Fu.

405
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,400
Zhang Qi.

406
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
I like you.

407
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,039
Wave your hand if you like me.

408
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,319
I'll marry you when you get back.

409
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:43,960
Done.

410
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,039
I'm also done.

411
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,359
Let me open it.

412
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,920
Haitang.

413
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,880
Haitang.

414
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,960
The landlady said it was New Year's Eve.

415
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,079
She gave us a cake to eat.

416
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,559
Here. Look, everyone.

417
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,160
It's still warm.

418
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:10,920
Here.

419
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,039
I'll carve it.

420
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,440
Here. Take one per person.

421
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,160
Take care. Don't grab it.

422
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,000
Zhang Qi.

423
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,319
Haitang.

424
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,119
Who are you?

425
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,559
Where's Zhang Qi?

426
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,559
Let's see what it is.

427
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
What's this?

428
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,640
A big plane.

429
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,319
Here, it's for Bu.

430
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,519
A big paper plane.

431
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:23,880
What...

432
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,160
What happened?

433
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,039
People in the next room are of
the 17th Squadron of the 3rd Brigade.

434
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,314
They said...

435
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,971
the whole Hanguang Squadron...

436
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,640
died in Jiangyin Campaign.

437
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,680
No.

438
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,920
I'm sure Zhang Qi is fine.

439
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:49,720
Captain.

440
00:30:51,657 --> 00:30:54,200
Captain, you're awake.

441
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,599
Are you better?

442
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,160
Great.

443
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,720
The doctor checked you out yesterday.

444
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,079
He said you were out of the danger zone now.

445
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,599
It's the New Year's Eve.

446
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,960
You're lucky because you wake up at this time.

447
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,839
You'll be the leader when you get better.

448
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,000
Captain.

449
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,079
Chen Ran.

450
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,160
No, Officer Chen.

451
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,240
Come on, why do you make such a fuss?

452
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,599
It's the New Year's Eve.

453
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,359
Crap!

454
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,279
I wish I had fought with Hanguang Squadron.

455
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,240
One more man and one more plane

456
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,839
would have nailed more enemy planes.

457
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,119
Chen Ran.

458
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,240
Captain, why don't you speak?

459
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,480
There will always be sacrifices in a war.

460
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,160
People who survived can keep fighting.

461
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, keep fighting.

462
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,559
We will never give in until we fight to death.

463
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,880
Don't even say that.

464
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,799
Fight for victory if fight.

465
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,599
Yeah, for victory.

466
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,400
Hangzhou.

467
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,920
Hangzhou is occupied.

468
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,559
Any news from Meng's Family?

469
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,319
I asked about it several times.

470
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,920
Uncle Meng has arrived in Kunming.
He's busy building the school.

471
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,540
Haitang and Yuanyin...

472
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,440
got separated from their families.

473
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:52,960
They sent a telegram that they'd
walked to Nanchang on December 6th.

474
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,540
We haven't heard one word from them since.

475
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,240
Walked?

476
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,960
They walked there?

477
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,160
It's so cold.

478
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,720
And the mountain paths are steep.

479
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,400
Two girls...

480
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,759
Captain.

481
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,119
It's okay.

482
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,680
Haitang went on a dig in Anyang with Professor Ling.

483
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,820
Hard times out there.

484
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,720
They can handle it.

485
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:24,480
Don't worry.

486
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,279
It's okay.

487
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,039
It's okay, captain.

488
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,240
Tell me once you get anything from them.

489
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,400
Yes.

490
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,680
Besides...

491
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:36,110
Besides what?

492
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,519
Besides,

493
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:45,440
don't tell her I'm injured.

494
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,750
Mark my words if you consider me a good friend.

495
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,960
Okay, trust me.

496
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,119
By the way, captain.

497
00:33:57,314 --> 00:33:59,110
Yesterday, Minister Tang told us that

498
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:02,039
your father called and said
he'd come to see you in Kunming.

499
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,279
Don't let him come over.

500
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:10,760
Did Minister Tang tell him I'm injured?

501
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,280
No. Relax.

502
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,159
Minister Tang told him we are in a closed training.

503
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:18,320
In principle, we don't allow our families to visit us.

504
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,679
And your father said he'd go to Nanyang

505
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,239
and raise money to support
the air force for the war at once.

506
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:25,238
He won't come to Kunming for now.

507
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,079
Here.

508
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,239
Captain, eat some apples.

509
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,685
It'll give you strength. Here.

510
00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:34,400
It'll get you better soon. Here you are.

511
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,079
Well, Niaoqiao is getting more like Huansheng.

512
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,240
Tomorrow...

513
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,000
we'll worship Huansheng and the guys.

514
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,039
Okay.

515
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,480
You know what, captain.

516
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:04,440
When you get better and can get out of bed,

517
00:35:04,514 --> 00:35:06,150
we'll go to visit them with you.

518
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,320
Yeah, we'll go together.

519
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,360
Here.

520
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,710
Fine. I'll find a wheelchair later.

521
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,719
We'll go tomorrow, okay?

522
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,080
[Wujiaba Airport, Yunnan]

523
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,079
Captain.

524
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:42,342
Look, that's the West Mountain ahead.

525
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:44,628
And Dianchi Lake is at the foot of it.

526
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:46,742
It's interesting in Kunming.

527
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:49,630
It has everything that Beiping has.

528
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,079
Beiping has Zhengyangmen.

529
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,228
It has Jinrilou.

530
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
It's worth a visit.

531
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,159
We'll go to visit the town
when the captain gets better.

532
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,599
I'm sure it'll feel familiar to you.

533
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,828
Because Kunming is like Beiping and Hangzhou.

534
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,039
Just stop.

535
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,000
Captain, why seven aircrafts?

536
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:55,599
And 019.

537
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,199
Say goodbye to Huansheng.

00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,079
Captain, drink some water.

557
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,840
Guys of Jianqiao all miss you.

558
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:39,070
Poshan and the fresh pilots
are waiting for you to train them.

559
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,800
You need to pull yourself together.

560
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,800
Don't be preoccupied all day.

561
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,440
Are you still worrying about Haitang?

562
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:56,971
Or are you thinking about other things?

563
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,159
Are you okay, captain?

564
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,440
What's wrong?

565
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:04,190
I'll get the doctor here. Hold it.

566
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,000
No need.

567
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,239
I'm okay.

568
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,360
Minister.

569
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,780
The Japanese have changed Jianqiao airport

570
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,457
into a flight base for invading East China.

571
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,760
Han Fuju ordered the 12th Army of the 3rd Corp

572
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
to withdraw to the south the other day.

573
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,719
Jinan was occupied.

574
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,840
Northeast China, East China
and North China all failed.

575
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,440
We lost half of our land.

576
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,280
And our aircrafts were almost destroyed.

577
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Zhang Qi, I asked you to
withdraw in a set amount of time.

578
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,800
Did you?

579
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,280
I should have arrested you for
defying the order during the war.

580
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,719
Six pilots of Hanguang Squadron were sacrificed.

581
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,599
We lost seven
Hawker III fighters and one Nuo Fighter.

582
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,440
Who should be responsible for that?

583
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,559
Don't tell me you were trying to cover
the army and the people's retreat.

584
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,880
You're the captain of Hanguang.

585
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,599
If it's not your fault, who should be blamed?

586
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,719
Yes.

587
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:32,514
I'm willing to take responsibility for that alone.

588
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,514
I'll accept the penalty.

589
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,600
We've got the outcome of the military trial.

590
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,371
Hanguang Squadron fought the enemy
valiantly in Jiangyin Campaign.

591
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,960
It destroyed seven enemy fighters,

592
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
did damage to the enemy craft

593
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,840
and covered Huangshan Battery
with its last breath.

594
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,159
However, it didn't withdraw in a set amount of time.

595
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,280
Although for good reason,

596
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,119
it's not in accordance with the order.

597
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,880
So, it's even. No punishment or reward.

598
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:12,742
I hope it guards against arrogance
and rashness and learn from the experience.

599
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Keep serving the party and
the country honestly and faithfully.

600
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,480
Yes.

601
00:41:33,028 --> 00:41:36,514
Fortunately you two of Hanguang Squadron are alive.

602
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:38,880
Zhang Qi.

603
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:43,510
I always keep the designation of Hanguang.

604
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:48,440
As long as you're alive, Hanguang will exist.

605
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,280
I still expect you to take back Jianqiao.

606
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,685
Now, I'm ordering you

607
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:06,800
to get better soon
and reorganize Hanguang Squadron.

608
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,519
Zhang Qi stays on as captain.

609
00:42:10,742 --> 00:42:12,857
Zeng Niaoqiao is the deputy captain.

610
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,400
And Chen Ran is the operator.

611
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:18,440
The rest of the members will be

612
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,590
supplied by the new trainees
from the 11th training class

613
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,679
and Yunnan Aviation School.

614
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,159
- Yes.
