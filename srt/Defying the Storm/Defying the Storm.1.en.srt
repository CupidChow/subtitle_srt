00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,060
In 1937,

15
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,500
before the burst of War of Resistance against Japan,

16
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,780
China has an elemental air power

17
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,900
but a weak foundation on industry.
[Jianqiao Base, Hangzhou]

18
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,860
The interior struggle,
corruption and confused commands

19
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,660
of Chinese Nationalist Party

20
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,340
weaken its strength.

21
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,580
What's the matter?

22
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,100
Within 30 miles of the air route,
the cumulonimbus is forming.

23
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,820
There are thunder, lightning, and heavy clouds.

24
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,260
The weather condition is getting poor.

25
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,460
He'll be overhead in about 20 minutes.

26
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,460
No radio. We have to lead him to land.

27
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,180
Check the time.

28
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,100
Ten o five in the evening.

29
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,340
According to our rules.

30
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,180
Guide him to land within 15 minutes.

31
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,780
Yes. Let's go.

32
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,780
I'm Lu Ziyi.

33
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,540
Deputy Director Lu is a member
of Central Aviation Council.

34
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,660
Central Aviation School appointed him

35
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,580
as the deputy director of
our Political Discipline Department.

36
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,100
Please cooperate with his work.

37
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,940
Who's Zeng Nianqiao?

38
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,380
Someone reports that

39
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,820
Zeng Nianqiao is under suspicion of

40
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,100
contacting Communist Party
and smuggling cultural relics.

41
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,140
I think the cultural relics
should still be on the warplanes.

42
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,060
Investigate all the planes.

43
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,580
Everyone! Protect our planes!

44
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,860
Zhang Qi, what are you doing?

45
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,380
Does Hanguang Squadron belong to you?

46
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,500
Zhang Qi. Put down your pistol.

47
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,700
Put down your guns.

48
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,020
And you!

49
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,100
Deputy Director Lu.

50
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,140
Jianqiao planes cannot be touched so easily.

51
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,660
Even if Central Aviation Council

52
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,780
and President Chen are here,

53
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,020
they still need to go with pilots and mechanics.

54
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,780
Anyhow, you only have the search warrant
to check his plane.

55
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,900
I won't think you want to make it serious.

56
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,420
Where's Zeng Nianqiao?

57
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,780
Report.

58
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,180
Operator Zeng Nianqiao is
carrying out an urgent task from Peiping.

59
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,100
He'll arrive here in eight minutes.

60
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,260
Because of the weather, radio
and the breakdown of the runway,

61
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,980
according to Aviation Safety Regulation,

62
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,020
we should turn off all the unnecessary lights here

63
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,220
and start to guide him on land.

64
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,380
Our captain was going to guide No. 095.

65
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,940
He can't land because of such a mist?

66
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,940
I'll check your skills for the council.

67
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,660
Let me see what the huge amount of funds can bring us.

68
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,500
What are you doing?

69
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,780
Cover me, 031 and 047.

70
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,700
Others guide him to land.

71
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,260
Yes.

72
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,380
Go to catch him!

73
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,540
Please wait, Deputy Director Lu.

74
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,220
I know you want to investigate Zeng Nianqiao's plane

75
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,540
but 095 is still in the sky.

76
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,380
I think the military commission should be primary.

77
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,820
The radio can't compare with
our captain and Guiding Tower.

78
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,500
Blind landing again.

79
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,100
Captain, catch me.

80
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,940
Catch him!

81
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,300
Zeng Nianqiao.

82
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,780
Where were you last night?

83
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,100
I was at No. 100 of Yunju Alley in Peiping.

84
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,180
No. 100 of Yunju Alley?

85
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,140
Yes.

86
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,300
Professors of Fuhua University live there

87
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,140
and I've grown up there too.

88
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,020
Mr. Jin is my respected teacher

89
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,140
so I went to visit him.

90
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,060
An informer said you went out hastily with a box.

91
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,420
Where's the box?

92
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,780
Box?

93
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,060
What do you say?

94
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,500
Pilots pay attention to speed

95
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,100
so we always walk fast.

96
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,460
I don't think it's anxiety.

97
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,540
There's a box on the plane.

98
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,780
But only a few books inside it.

99
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,140
- Take him away.
- Yes.

100
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,100
Wait!

101

Deputy Director Lu.

102
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,100
Jianqiao is a Central Aviation school.

103
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,940
It should be managed by
Aviation Bureau of Military Commission.

104
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,020
Do you have any conclusive proofs
to take my team member away?

105
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,340
Zhang Qi.

106
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,860
"Qi" represents open-mindedness.

107
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,060
Flying instructor and
the captain of the Hanguang Squadron.

108
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,740
We've been investigating who's the communist inside us.

109
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,660
It's said communists have hidden here for long.

110
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,860
When we asked our air force to suppress enemies,

111
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,940
the communists hidden in Jianqiao let the news out

112
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,660
so that the Communist Party could escape to Yan'an.

113
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,980
Captain Zhang.

114
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,140
I doubt you're the one I want.

115
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,340
Bring him back together.

116
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
Yes.

117
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,740
Who dares to act?

118
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,140
Hold on a second.

119
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,860
Deputy Director Lu, do you know Fuxing Plane?

120
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,820
Last Friday, the president of Guangdong
United Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Zhang Buchun,

121
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,340
spent millions to donate two Fuxing Planes
to Central Air Force.

122
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,420
The reception ceremony will be held this week.

123
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,300
Our chairman even inscribed

124
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,140
"Aim for the Sky" for it.

125
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,780
Medium report it a lot.

126
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,460
Does it matter?

127
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,540
Do you know who he is?

128
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,860
He's the youngest son of Zhang Buchun.

129
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,260
His father donates millions to our party.

130
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,380
It's a patriotic model.

131
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,220
How could his son be a communist?

132
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,020
Chairman's last birthday,

133
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,100
Zhang Qi guided an air group to form words for him.

134
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,660
- I...
- Shut up!

135
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,580
Minister Tang.

136
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,260
Please discipline your Captain Zhang.

137
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,540
Ask him not to bother other things.

138
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,020
Don't implicate Hanguang Squadron.

139
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,380
Otherwise, it will bring shame on the chairman.

140
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,700
Take Zeng Nianqiao away.

141
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,460
- Let's leave.
- Yes.

142

All the oil leaked out.

144
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,300
If we hadn't guided him to land, he would have died.

145
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,180
Last month, the Third Brigade lost 2 planes
for the same reason.

146
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,660
The nationalist government spent millions
on imported planes from Italy and America

147
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,340
but they're all secondhand.

148
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,860
They're all like this.

149
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,100
We have to go to Peiping again.

150
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,020
You're so arbitrary.

[Hangzhou, Jianqiao Aviation School]

152

Do you apply to go to Peiping to accept Fuxing Plane?

153
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,060
I know your mind.

154

Don't think too much.

I didn't look down upon your father's donation.

I really respect him and his behavior.

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,540
I need to ask you something.

333
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,260
So do I.

334
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,900
I want to say something to you too.

335
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,380
Well... I'm going to my room first.

336
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,740
You should act like a girl. Don't you understand?

337
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,140
Tidy up your clothes.

338
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,740
Sit down.

339
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,780
No.

340
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,620
Have the seat.

341
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,540
I refuse.

342
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,220
You've gotten the admission letter?

343
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,540
Congratulations.

344
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,660
You're now a college student.

345
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,300
I want to learn Chinese Studies.

346
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,340
But why education?

347
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,940
I went to find President Yu.

348
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,780
I changed it.

349
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
Father.

350
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,580
Do you think it's appropriate?

351
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,780
Why not appropriate?

352
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,500
In public,

353
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,620
how can Secretary General
of Fuhua University abuse his power

354
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,980
to change a student's admission decision?

355
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,140
In private,

356
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,460
you know I want to learn archaeology!

357
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,980
In public,

358
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,580
the university has the right to

359
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,540
allocate students' admissions.

360
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,100
In private,

361
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,820
our ancestors witnessed our national flag

362
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,300
was changed three times in a day on Tongji Ship.

363
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,180
Then he felt the importance of education
on saving the nation.

364
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,940
He exhorted his offspring to think highly of it.

365
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,380
It's our ancestor's opinion.

366
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,900
Not mine.

367
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,580
I only want to learn archaeology.

368
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,380
Haitang.

369
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,060
Archaeology doesn't fit you.

370
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:43,020
You almost need to stay in desolate places everyday.

371
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,060
You're too weak to suffer it.

372
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,940
Anyway, I don't want to study education.

373
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,860
I'll go to find President Yu when term begins.

374
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,060
I can go to resit.

375
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,820
- Dare you?
- Yes.

376
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,540
If nothing else, I'll leave now.

377
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,380
I have to go to Archaeological Society later.

378
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
Stay there!

379
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,580
You've expressed your ideas

380
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,060
but I haven't finished mine.

381
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,620
Come back and sit down.

382
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,940
I refuse!

383
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,460
Last week,

384
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,450
you asked me about Uncle Zhang Buchun
who donated planes?

385
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,220
Do you remember?

386
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,940
No.

387
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,580
You said he's like a monkey.

388
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,780
Don't you remember?

389
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,180
He has a son called Zhang Qi.

390
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,420
He's a pilot of
Jianqiao Central Aviation School in Hangzhou.

391
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,020
Young and handsome.

392
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,660
He's at a similar age to you.

393
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,980
So we've set a betrothal for you two
since you were young.

394
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,180
Your mother thinks
you should get in touch with him now.

395
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,940
Father.

396
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,780
You've told me you wouldn't agree with mom

397
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,740
but what is it now?

398
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,140
Are the civilization and freedom you mention fake?

399
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,220
What does it matter?

400
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,020
We know Zhang Qi well.

401
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,060
The reason why your mom mentions it

402
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,260
is that she cares you a lot.

403
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,500
The situation is now in turmoil.

404
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,900
You can't be reckless.

405
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,060
He's arrived in Peiping yesterday.

406
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,740
I've invited him to our home this afternoon.

407
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,900
We'll dine together this evening.

408
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,820
He's come from distance.

409
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,500
We need to attend him well.

410
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,340
Go to change into decent clothes.

411
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,380
Don't say anything rude when you meet him.

412
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,340
- Understand?
- No.

413
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,740
I want to attend archaeology activities.

414
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,420
You can go nowhere!

415
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,540
Just stay in your room,

416
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,180
reading and reflecting upon yourself.

417
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,260
Come with me.

418
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,420
You like taking photos?

419
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,300
Peiping is beautiful.

420
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,700
Take it as a memento.

421
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,060
Haitang.

422
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Come out. Zhang Qi is here.

423
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,140
Haitang.

424
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,580
Wandering in the yard is an interest.

425
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,700
Though there's a gate, it's always close.

426
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,460
Walking around with my crutch...

427
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,740
Have some tea, please.

428
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,780
I'll be right back.

429
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,140
He's been here for a while.

430
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,300
Come out to meet him.

431
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,260
I don't want status and wealth.

432
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,140
I don't expect to be an immortal.

433
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,500
You're so absurd!

434
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,980
Come out at once!

435
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,940
I'd like to appreciate brilliant views myself

436
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,740
or plow and plant in my own yard.

437
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,100
Do you refuse to come out?

438
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,460
Fine. Just stay there.

439
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,620
You can go nowhere today.

440
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,420
My daughter is diligent.

441
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,380
She won't come out of her room
until she finishes studying.

442
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,660
Qi.

443
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,180
When you're studying in Fuhua,

444
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,100
we've gone to France for academic exchange.

445
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,060
So there's no chance to invite you to my home.

446
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,540
Haitang will study at Normal University this year.

447
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,460
Haichen will take the entrance exam next year.

448
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,460
I planted a begonia tree when we moved in.

449
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,620
When she was born,

450
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,780
all the flowers bloomed.

451
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,700
That's why I named her "Haitang" (Begonia).

452
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,340
Uncle Meng.

453
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,940
I'm here to beg for your help.

454
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,580
Qi.

455
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,460
You're too polite.

456
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,260
Your father and I have been friends for years.

457
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,980
As long as I could help you, I won't decline.

458
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:10,100
Except the recruitment of pilots in Fuhua.

459
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,860
Except it.

460
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,420
That's my essential intention.

461
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
Why do you oppose it so much?

462
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,540
By the way.

463
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,820
Here's the invitation card for you
to join the trial flight of Fuxing Plane.

464
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,260
I'm sorry I could help you nothing
about the recruitment.

465
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,300
Only armies need people?

466
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,500
Industry, agriculture, commerce and medical science...

467
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,580
Every field needs talents!

468
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,540
Studying also can serve the nation!

469
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,100
If they all sacrifice,

470
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,180
there's no future for our country and nation!

471
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,380
Anyhow, everyone has his or her own will.

472
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,940
You join the army and your father donates planes.

473
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,420
I really admire your behavior.

474
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,900
Qi, I'll support the activity

475
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,220
because it's your father's chivalrous deed.

476
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,060
I have to answer the phone.

477
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,220
Excuse me, Qi.

478
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,300
Something urgent in the university.

479
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,900
I have to go back now.

480
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,139
What troubled times!

481
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,580
Sorry for the impoliteness.

482
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,100
Meng.

483
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,139
I have to work now but you can chat with your aunt.

484
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,780
Meng wrote a letter to your father.

485
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
Please bring it back.

486
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,420
I'm now fetching it.

487
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,020
You can come out if you want.

488
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,060
I don't want to go out.

489
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,540
I'm now studying.

490
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,420
A record in Xinwei year, emperor's wife Hao...

491
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,820
If you really like oracle bone inscriptions,

492
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,180
you should call her "Hao". It should be "Zi".

493
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,020
Surname decides one's family

494
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,380
while name divides one's class.

495
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,220
I think you should call her "Zi".

496
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,860
Both are fine.

497
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,100
How do you know that?

498
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,140
I don't know much.

499
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,940
Mr. Jin once told me about it.

500
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,220
That's it.

501
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,620
She's the first female general
recorded by oracle bone inscriptions.

502
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,780
She's honorable and the emperor loved her so much.

503
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,860
She's respected.

504
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,580
You know her either?

505
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,940
Zhang Qi.

506
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,380
Thanks a lot.

507
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,180
Let me see you off.

508
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,260
No thanks, aunt. I can leave myself.

509
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
Fine.

510
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,260
See you.

511
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,380
Take care.

512
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,420
Hello?

513
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,940
He has a son called Zhang Qi.

514
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,180
Young and handsome.

515
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,820
He's at a similar age of you.

516
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,020
So we've set a betrothal for you two.

517
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,620
Your mother thinks you should get in touch with him now.

518
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,060
Aren't you...

519
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,020
I'm...

520
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,020
What?

521
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,420
Youngsters of the new era should be our own masters.

522
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,420
A man like you who can't decide his own marriage

523
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,940
is really acting like a fool.

524
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,540
I don't think a vulgar man like you
could know what I mean.

525
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,860
Anyway, leave here at once.

526
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,900
Don't come back.

527
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,740
Far more than a fool?

528
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,380
Confucius said

529
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,100
Ning Wuzi is smart when the nation is in order.

530
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,660
He pretends to be a fool when it's in a mess.

531
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,060
Others could compare with his wisdom

532
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,460
of being smart, not acting like a fool.

533
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,900
Acting like a fool here is
to praise someone who knows the condition well.

534
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,620
Family Meng is a family of scholars.

535
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,620
So how could Mr. Meng's daughter know nothing about it?

536
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,500
I think you shouldn't be Miss Meng Haitang.

537
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,580
You know a lot.

538
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,620
I'm absolutely not Meng Haitang.

539
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,380
It's a fine day so I'm out to bask.

540
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,220
A fine day.

541
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,900
Okay.

542
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,700
Stay safe.

543
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,100
By the way.

544
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,900
If you're not a member of Family Meng,

545
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,460
then you should get off early.

546
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,540
Otherwise someone will treat you as a thief.

547
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,980
Hey!

548
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,820
I have a name.

549
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,900
I'm called Zhang Qi.

550
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,580
Come back first.

551
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,620
You don't want to bask in the sun anymore?

552
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,900
Please do me a favor.

553
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,580
Turn around and bend over.

554
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,820
I can get down myself.

555
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,900
I've never learned to bend over.

556
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,700
Just jump. I'll catch you.

557
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,900
♫ Shimmer goes through the cloud ♫

What are you doing?

564
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,580
There's a flower.

565
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,780
And here.

566
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,220
There's a "flower" falling on me either.

567
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,860
You're really a flighty playboy.

568
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,660
Wait a minute.

569
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,980
You're a soldier so I don't want to lie to you.

570
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,460
Secretary General Meng
dislikes students joining the army.

571
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,060
As you're so young, you must
have quit your study to join the army.

572
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,340
Secretary General Meng won't like it.

573
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,860
Don't scheme to marry his daughter.

574
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,780
How did you know I abandoned my study?

575
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,820
As you hide nothing, I want to tell you something too.

576
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,140
No egg can stay in a broken nest.

577
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,340
Do something to save our nation.

578
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,980
Rather than staying there indifferently.
