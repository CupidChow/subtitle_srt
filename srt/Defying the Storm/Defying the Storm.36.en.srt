00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,710
[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,910
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:36,571
Well, call me dad.

4
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,428
Dad.

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,879
Captain.

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,680
Well, what do you think?

7
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:00,342
Sir, you're amazing.

8
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,628
It's a bit narrow down there,

9
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,719
but it leads right to the back of the lab.

10
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:08,800
And there's an iron door
that's 40 centimeters thick

11
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,200
between it and the wind tunnel lab.

12
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,599
In this case, even the 55 kilos missile
of B-25 can't destroy it.

13
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
Without a missile that's more than 500 kilos,

14
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,714
my lab is unbeatable.

15
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,639
Although the wind tunnel is narrow,

16
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:27,759
maybe the first jet plane
in China will fly out of here.

17
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,400
Zhang Qi.

18
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
You can blow anywhere.

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,680
Try not to bomb this place.

20
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,800
If you blow here up, I'm okay with it,

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,771
but Mr. Meng will fight you.

22
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:45,120
Therefore,

23
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,039
forget it.

24
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,039
I have another secret.

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Come on. There is one more secret.

26
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,057
This iron button can control
the iron door when you hit it.

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,171
Look.

28
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,371
What do you think?

29
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,960
There's another secret in there.

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,680
Come on.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,159
Come on. Here.

32
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,080
Look.

33
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,280
Here we are again after we took a turn around it.

34
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,430
Come on. Hurry.

35
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,457
Come with me. This way.

36
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,400
Just in case, I installed a set of switches here.

37
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,028
Come on. Look.

38
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,800
In case of emergency,
this can also control that iron door.

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,240
How? Am I wise?

40
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:04,590
Minister Tang, here's the order
from Kunming Defense Command.

41
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,028
I know it's hard for you.

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,199
But orders are orders.

43
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:17,085
Our aviation school is obliged
to support the conquest of Mongyu.

44
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,959
But the school is an empty shell now.

45
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:23,270
Its former main pilot, Zhang Qi, the captain
of Hanguang Squadron got transferred.

46
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,571
And its deputy captain,
Zeng Nianqiao is still missing.

47
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,971
The fighters are almost retired.

48
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:31,885
Few planes can fly and fight.

49
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:36,000
Supervisor Bai, I'm not refusing the order.

50
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,828
I can't offer support without weapons.

51
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,942
According to credible intelligence,

52
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:53,480
Okayama Shinichi is not only a scholar,

53
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,720
but also a member of Panlong Society.

54
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,399
A mission team of the remnants
of the Japanese 56th Division

55
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,371
is active in Hongshi with him.

56
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,628
They know how to fight in mountains and jungles.

57
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:10,630
Once the mission team makes
Hongshi Lab their stronghold,

58
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,114
and opens the way to reinforce Mongyu,

59
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:20,220
it's very bad for our troops
in India to capture Mongyu.

60
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,399
Therefore, the Aviation Council

61
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,720
and Kunming Defense Command
gave instructions together.

62
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,439
They ordered the Air Force Officer School
to bomb the stronghold with fighters.

63
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,400
This action can dispel
the bad international influence

64
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,200
caused by the loss of the cultural relic.

65
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:41,360
More importantly, it'll stop the remnants
of the Japanese 56th Division

66
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,828
from reinforcing Mongyu.

67
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,400
Minister Tang,

68
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,942
it's now or never.

69
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,171
Minister Tang, are you doubting
the quality of my intelligence?

70
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:11,828
The Aviation Council?

71
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,428
I see.

72
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:19,142
Supervisor Bai, you have a strong
relationship with the Aviation Council.

73
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,000
It didn't pass the order.

74
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:23,371
But you're transmitting the order to me in person.

75
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:27,142
I know your intel must be solid.

76
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,720
My man, Zeng Nianqiao,
the deputy captain of Hanguang Squadron

77
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,514
and my former student, Zhang Qi,

78
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,950
got lost near the mountains
in Hongshi the other day.

79
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,485
Their whereabouts are unknown.

80
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,942
They might be in the target.

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,800
While Meng Wuran, Zeng Mu and Ling Wenyue

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,360
are all professors of Fuhua University.

83
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,560
They're also in the target.

84
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:50,571
Besides, they're all influential.

85
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:53,028
If I ask my men to carry out the task,

86
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,360
how can them escape?

87
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,485
Or, are there other troops that can rescue them?

88
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,519
If not, I'm afraid our people would be killed.

89
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,600
Take Mongyu,

90
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,600
the Chinese troops in India
and the expeditionary forces

91
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:17,920
can completely open up Ledo Road.

92
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:20,390
Then we might win the war.

93
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,630
Several people die for the country,

94
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,200
or the world is ruined for several people.

95
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,560
Minister Tang, I hope you think about it.

96
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,079
Zhang Qi and Zeng Nianqiao are both soldiers.

97
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Ignoring that we're not sure if they're in Hongshi,

98
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,199
even if they're there,

99
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,085
it's their duty and honor to die for the country.

100
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,360
Think about it.

101
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:45,360
Those professors are defenseless scholars.

102
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,120
And that Miss. Meng is weak.

103
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,800
They even dare confront the Japanese.

104
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,742
I guess they're ready to die for the country.

105
00:07:56,971 --> 00:08:00,070
We're soldiers who defend the land for the nation.

106
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,720
But we're indecisive.

107
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,310
I'll send a fighter to complete the task.

108
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,360
We'll destroy Hongshi Lab
and the way to Mongyu at a certain time.

109
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,120
Good.

110
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,720
Supervisor Bai.

111
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,720
Zhang Qi was my student.

112
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,800
I must stress that I accept the order
because I'm a soldier.

113
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:31,360
Don't read into it.

114
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,120
A top-secret mission.

115
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,080
2127 takes only one bomber, Zou Shenghong.

116
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,200
No gunners or radio operators.

117
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,799
Liu Yaokun is the navigator.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,790
Fly with full missiles
and destroy the target completely.

119
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:08,550
Return to Longling for refueling
as soon as you finish the task.

120
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:19,550
Remember, the name of the mission is Hongshi.

121
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:22,960
It's a top secret forever.

122
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,600
Remember?

123
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,320
Yes.

124
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,000
Dad, what's that light?

125
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,200
Zhang Qi.

126
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:39,314
Here's a question for you.

127
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:41,485
What's it on the ground?

128
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:00,840
Orthophosphoric acid.

129
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:02,571
Right.

130
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,257
Yunnan is a land of phosphate.

131
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,485
Looks like we got it under Yemang Mountain.

132
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:13,840
Let it be fireworks for wishing
us good luck tomorrow night.

133
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,742
- Who's it?
- Here's something.

134
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
Brother, is it you?

135
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,679
It's you!

136
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,159
Brother.

137
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,679
Donglai.

138
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,440
Donglai.

139
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Brother.

140
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,240
Brother.

141
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,919
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

142
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,030
That's great.

143
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,857
Oh yeah, I have something to tell you.

144
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,399
Haichen gave it to me.

145
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,600
He stayed there alone.

146
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,039
Donglai.

147
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,120
Haichen gave this amulet to you.

148
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:03,910
He must want you to finish what he wants to finish.

149
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,279
He asked me to send the message.

150
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,840
I met Zhenzhu's guard
when I was at the intersection of Hongshi.

151
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,919
We almost had a fight.

152
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,550
If not for that, I'd go to Jianling.

153
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:14,628
In that case, I'd miss you.

154
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,960
So,

155
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,742
you were in Xiangping.

156
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:29,200
According to Lu Ziyi
and the regular pace of the army,

157
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,440
the Japanese 56th Division will arrive at Hongshi,

158
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,870
between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m.

159
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,550
If the way is clear, they'll arrive
in Mongyu at midnight, tomorrow.

160
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,200
Looks like they timed it perfectly

161
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:41,480
to launch an attack in the middle of night.

162
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,670
There's only an hour or one and a half

163
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:50,039
between the time of the deal and the arrival time
of the Japanese 56th Division.

164
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,171
No wonder Okayama is imperious.

165
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:58,080
Where's Uncle Meng?

166
00:11:58,457 --> 00:11:59,600
And Haichen.

167
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,030
All that you said makes me confused.

168
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,600
What good would the deal do?

169
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,200
Brother, give me the gun.

170
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,360
Zhenzhu, assign the uncle
who just showed me the way to me.

171
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,000
I have to save Haichen.

172
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,559
I'm afraid...

173
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,720
it's too late.

174
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,639
I don't care. I'll go to save him.

175
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,771
Zhang Qi is right. Sit down.

176
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,879
As the underground party branch secretary
of the Air Force Officer School,

177
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,960
I'm holding the branch meeting before the war

178
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,600
to discuss tomorrow's battle plan.

179
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:22,400
I talked with Haitang just now.

180
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,685
She'll hold off the enemies tomorrow.

181
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:27,080
You protect Mr. Zeng to get tung oil.

182
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,910
I'll hide nearby with Chengying.

183
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,428
Deal with the enemies depending on the situation.

184
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:34,240
We've lost contact with the organization.

185
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,360
Although Chengying brought some news here,

186
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,159
war changes quickly.

187
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,085
All I'm worried about is,

188
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,270
whether our mission will help the whole situation.

189
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:52,510
Lately, the KMT troops suffered
much great defeat on the battlefield.

190
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,200
Hengyang was fallen in August.

191
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,200
In November, Guilin and Liuzhou were lost.

192
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,039
The forces under Zhang Fakui
in Guangxi retreated from the west,

193
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,828
which made the Japanese troops occupy Dushan.

194
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:07,028
Although they've withdrawn from Dushan now,

195
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:09,940
their next move is more obvious.

196
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:12,870
My analysis is that they might attack Kunming.

197
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:16,910
In such a situation, the war is getting worse.

198
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
Chiang Kai-shek could only say
Guiyang could be abandoned.

199
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,960
But Chongqing must be kept.

200
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,679
That means he's at the end of his rope.

201
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,879
Now we're on the key part of Burma Road.

202
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,639
According to the analysis of Li Donglai's intel,

203
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,039
the enemies will move towards Mongyu

204
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,685
and meet the Japanese troops in India.

205
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:37,320
We must cut off the side road to Mongyu.

206
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,440
You guys, things have changed.

207
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,120
This is Comrade Gao Lin, the messenger
of the CPC underground party branch in Kunming.

208
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,679
He and Comrade Xu Zhice have
been lurking in the camp in Kunming,

209
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,720
cooperating with me.

210
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,320
Comrade Xu Zhice will guide Okayama tomorrow.

211
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,600
He'll lead them up here.

212
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,440
Oh yeah, Gao Lin brought further
instructions from the organization in Kunming.

213
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,399
Thank you, comrade. Sit.

214
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,159
It's an emergency. I'll just get to the mission.

215
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,159
According to the latest intelligence,

216
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,759
we have to rescue those
professors of Fuhua University,

217
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,028
keep them safe,

218
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,919
and stop the mission team of
the Japanese 56th Division from fleeing to Mongyu.

219
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
We should block them

220
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,440
and blow up the way from here to Mongyu.

221
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,159
Now, count me and Zhice in, there are only five people.

222
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:25,320
Weapons are not enough.

223
00:15:25,428 --> 00:15:27,714
But we must finish the task.

224
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,000
Our suggestion is,

225
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:31,840
we save Professor Meng together first.

226
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,670
Then Comrade Zhanlu and Comrade Chunjun

227
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,342
will take them out of here with a plane here.

228
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:39,390
Zhice and I will deal with it here.

229
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
You two?

230
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,080
How can you two handle so many enemies?

231
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,879
No way. I'll stay here with you.

232
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,630
No. There's another assignment for you.

233
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,057
You're in charge of the mission of
persuading your father Bai Fei to allying with us.

234
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,840
Comrades,

235
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:03,080
I have an idea.

236
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:06,960
May I have the attention
of you two and the organization?

237
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,630
You guys, according to what we know right now,

238
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,740
we decided to carry out Plan B.

239
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:39,870
We have no guns or ammo now.

240
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:42,150
We can fly B-25 with missiles.

241
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,870
The potassium nitrate that we made

242
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,657
can only produce four missiles, 55 kilos each.

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,480
One for the lab.

244
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,840
The remaining three may be
enough to blow up the road.

245
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:55,910
The last two, 51 kilos each, are kept for Xishan.

246
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,790
We don't have a control tower.

247
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,685
So, we'll contact each other
with this configuration.

248
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,913
We've been experienced at running
for air-raid shelter over the years.

249
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,510
The success of the operation depends on

250
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,314
whether the signal is conveyed accurately.

251
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,000
Here's the lab.

252
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,000
This is the big tree in front of the lab.

253
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:25,160
And this is the highland behind the lab.

254
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:26,590
Here's the apron.

255
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:33,085
First, set two warning signals
at the intersection and the hillside.

256
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,914
Use bamboo whistles to send the signals.

257
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:37,750
Comrade Gao Lin is in charge of this place.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,750
No problem.

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
Set an observation post on this position,

260
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,720
like the first formal warning signal
when the Japanese planes entered Yunnan.

261
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:48,640
Send the signal once you notice the enemies.

262
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,000
At this site, we can always
observe the situation of the lab.

263
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,600
So we should keep contact at all times.

264
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,680
- Li Donglai.
- Yes.

265
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:30,400
This position faces the enemies. It's dangerous.

266
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:33,480
So we need someone who's fast and good at hiding.

267
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,800
Can you do it?

268
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:36,400
Trust me, brother.

269
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,559
However, which warning way are we going to use?

270
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,480
During the Air Battle on April 28th,

271
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:45,428
the Japanese spies
signaled their planes with flares.

272
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,030
We're going to play it in their way.

273
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:50,628
I have them all ready.

274
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,200
This is for you, kid.

275
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:57,200
I took off several small devices. Look.

276
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,160
These lenses are all useful.

277
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,000
Here they come.

278
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,960
Haitang.

279
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,640
You're like the second warning signal
when the Japanese planes entered Kunming.

280
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,285
You have to resist the enemies,

281
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:30,680
and you might be in a blind spot.

282
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,240
So, we'll set a mobile signal tower.

283
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:36,057
Mr. Ling is acting as it.

284
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,319
Zhenzhu.

285
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,720
Here's your position.

286
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:00,480
It's the highest. You can see the apron.

287
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,790
Perfect to be Wuhua Mountain.

288
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,400
So, I'm the person who hangs the lantern.

289
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,400
Remember,

290
00:20:22,857 --> 00:20:26,680
your task is not to defeat the enemies,
but to keep the signal unobstructed.

291
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:31,070
Besides, we need a set of
more precise signal language.

292
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:32,680
Haitang.

293
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,110
I'll show you a set of light codes.

294
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,542
The Japanese won't know
its meaning even if they notice that.

295
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:53,428
It's called Qiming Code.

296
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,920
What's it?

297
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,160
This is a set of codes I invented
when I was in the U.S. military school.

298
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:03,428
It's called Qiming Code.

299
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,000
Qiming Code?

300
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,142
The meaning of what I just played is,

301
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:12,920
I love you forever.

302
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:32,340
The crucial part of the operation
is the air control force.

303
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,240
I repaired B-25.

304
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:36,800
I'm familiar with its condition.

305
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:39,880
So, I'll fly B-25 to carry out bombing raids.

306
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,428
Nianqiao, you need to get the tung oil for me
before 4:30 p.m. with Mr. Zeng.

307
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,285
I have 15 minutes to fuel it up.

308
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
Then I'll fly up to the sky at once.

309
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,640
- Zeng Nianqiao.
- Yes.

310
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,839
- Make sure to deliver the tung oil to me.
- Yes.

311
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,119
Target for 2127 is Yemang Mountain in Hongshi.

312
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,680
2127, altitude 1,200.

313
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,359
speed, 400 knots, course 130.

314
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,750
ETA to the target is an hour and 40 minutes.

315
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,200
Kid, hold still.

316
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:27,119
My oil.

317
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,200
- Smooth.
- Don't worry, father.

318
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,028
What's going on?

319
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:50,110
- Who's he?
- Father, get down.

320
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,480
What to do?

321
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,880
Don't let them shoot.

322
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,559
The oil will blow.

323
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,085
Don't let them shoot.

324
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,440
Get down, father.

325
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,599
My oil.

326
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:22,790
Damn. You guys got no sense.

327
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,319
It'll blow.

328
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,480
Don't shoot here.

329
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,799
My oil, my...

330
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,319
I'll fight you!

331
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,079
Don't touch my oil!

332
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,400
Don't move my oil!

333
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,039
Don't touch!

334
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,240
Don't shoot!

335
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,960
Father.

336
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,920
Father.

337
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,720
Father, are you okay? Father.

338
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,960
- Father, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

339
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,799
- Is my oil okay?
- It's okay.

340
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,028
What time is it now?

341
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:24,914
Almost the appointed time.

342
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,200
Go.

343
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,799
Don't care about me. Go.

344
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,839
Okay.

345
00:26:02,342 --> 00:26:05,314
Why haven't Nianqiao and Mr. Zeng arrived?

346
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,640
Faster! Drive faster!

347
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,720
Okay, don't worry.

348
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,599
Father.

349
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,920
Haitang.

350
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,400
Father.

351
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,400
Haitang.

352
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,000
Father.

353
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,359
Don't touch my father.

354
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,142
Haitang, that's crazy.

355
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,960
Miss Meng Haitang.

356
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:58,400
Where's Mr. Ling Wenyue?

357
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,440
Do you know where he is?

358
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,559
Mr. Ling has left.

359
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:08,114
I have the oracle bone inscriptions
of Wuding that you want.

360
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,480
Let my father go before you get it.

361
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:13,640
She doesn't know where it is.

362
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,000
It was lost in Hangzhou three years ago.

363
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,920
She's talking nonsense for saving me.

364
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,960
You... She's lying.

365
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,119
It has nothing to do with her.

366
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,000
Let her go.

367
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,240
Father.

368
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,079
Donglai brought it to Hangzhou three years ago.

369
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,200
I've kept it for all these years.

370
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:32,228
I didn't tell you because I thought you'd be worried.

371
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,400
I'm Mr. Ling's student and your daughter.

372
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,319
Let me protect you.

373
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
Haitang.

374
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:52,070
Miss Meng, how can I know you're not lying to me?

375
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,960
No matter how precious it is,

376
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:58,350
it's just a lifeless oracle bone.

377
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:01,142
People are more important than it.

378
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,799
I can give it to you.

379
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:05,350
But you should promise us,

380
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,440
you won't make it harder for all of us when you get it.

381
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:15,720
Okay.

382
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:20,310
Mr. Okayama, you should think carefully.

383
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,720
We're in middle of nowhere.

384
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:23,590
If you don't let my father go,

385
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:27,085
you can't find it even if you tear this place apart.

386
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,914
Miss Meng, I'll trust you this time.

387
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,119
Release Mr. Meng.

388
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,519
- Father.
- Haitang.

389
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,519
- Are you okay?
- That's crazy.

390
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,480
Listen to me,

391
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,039
Zhang Qi is here, he'll protect me.

392
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,160
You need to leave first.

393
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,680
Are you safe?

394
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,960
Don't worry, father.

395
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,510
Let my father go.

396
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,240
Okay.

397
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,279
Okayama,

398
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,559
you're a famous scholar.

399
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,920
You won't hurt my daughter.

400
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,720
Can I trust you?

401
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:20,270
Mr. Meng, of course, you should trust me.

402
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,400
All I want is the oracle bone
inscriptions of Wuding.

403
00:29:22,514 --> 00:29:25,400
Once I get it, your daughter is no good for me.

404
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,640
So, trust me, I'm a gentleman.

405
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,200
I won't hurt her.

406
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:34,742
Mr. Meng, please.

407
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,400
You mustn't hurt my daughter.

408
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,880
Understand?

409
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,319
Father.

410
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,440
Wait for us.

411
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,000
Please.

412
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,285
Miss Meng, can you take me to see
the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding?

413
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,119
Go.

414
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:40,310
We found an apron on the back hill.

415
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,359
There's a fighter and a small runway.

416
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,759
So, B-25 is just a cover.

417
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:05,640
If nothing goes wrong and I can fuel it in time,

418
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,119
B-25 is the first choice.

419
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:08,571
It can do significant damage.

420
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:11,000
But if something goes wrong,

421
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:13,440
I can't drag that big plane.

422
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,480
As for Xishan, although it's an old type,

423
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,680
it's light and flexible.

424
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,750
It consumes less oil.

425
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:24,228
And with the modification from Mr. Zeng,

426
00:31:24,742 --> 00:31:29,640
I believe it's still the most potent weapon
in the air battle.

427
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:32,960
But Xishan got a big problem.

428
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:36,350
It can only hang two missiles, 51 kilos each.

429
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,480
Two missiles are enough to blow up the buildings.

430
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,057
I'm afraid it's hard to blow up
the road with the remaining two.

431
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:21,885
Please move the table for me.

432
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:16,914
Mr. Okayama, you said,

433
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:19,830
once you verified it was true,

434
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:21,657
you'd let me go at once.

435
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,359
Of course.

436
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:09,000
Miss Meng, you should give me some real evidence.

437
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,920
Or, I won't let you go.

438
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,639
The evidence lies on
these three cinnabar carvings.

439
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,230
What do you mean?

440
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,320
It came from the Yin Dynasty.

441
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,320
It's been more than 3,000 years.

442
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:28,510
Carvings of Oracle bones from Shang
were always painted with cinnabar

443
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,342
and buried in the ground for thousands of years.

444
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,571
There's much hematite around Xiaotun in Anyang.

445
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,360
For a long time,

446
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:36,280
the hematite penetrated into oracle bones.

447
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,360
So, there's cinnabar and hematite on the carvings.

448
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,880
Mr. Okayama, do you accept this conclusion?

449
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,159
I don't deny it.

450
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:49,630
What you said might make sense.

451
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,800
Mr. Okayama, you've studied
inscriptions on bones for many years.

452
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:57,942
You must know we can't tell
cinnabar from hematite by eye.

453
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:02,190
But they're quite different
under X-ray Debye camera.

454
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:03,920
As far as I know,

455
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,119
Mr. Okayama, you got a fake seven years ago.

456
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,085
You took it to Japan and verified it.

457
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:12,760
I guess you verified it with a professional camera.

458
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,519
Yes. So?

459
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,599
So,

460
00:36:18,685 --> 00:36:21,110
here's Fuhua University's physics lab.

461
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:24,857
It just got an X-ray Debye camera.

462
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:29,559
I asked Professor Zeng to leave it here
so you can verify the oracle bone inscriptions.

463
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:44,228
Haitang.

464
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,360
As I understand it,

465
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:49,960
the key of your plan is in Kunming.

466
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:59,159
You want Ms. Kang to battle Okayama Shinichi

467
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,719
and see who sends out the manuscript first, right?

468
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,440
Yes.

469
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:05,630
Ms. Kang is busy publishing lately
and she has to contact the major media.

470
00:37:06,342 --> 00:37:08,440
She's as rigorous as Uncle Ling.

471
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:10,030
Although Uncle Ling isn't with her,

472
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,971
she'll publish Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar
at the right time.

473
00:37:14,914 --> 00:37:18,971
It's also a battle for Lanshan.

474
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,079
It's 5:30 a.m.

475
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,079
After we verify it's real,

476
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:36,920
send the telegram to Asahi Shinbun Office in China

477
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,280
and ask it to send the news to the world.

478
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:40,280
Yes.

479
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,057
They've got the oracle bone inscriptions
and it's being examined now.

480
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,800
Once they verified it's real,

481
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,639
send the telegram to all of the newspapers.

482
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:29,670
Yes.

483
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,171
[January 21th, 17:35]

484
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,559
Mom, I asked the students of
Left-Wing Association to help us.

485
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,000
We're all your bodyguards.

486
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,639
Okay.

487
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,000
Qianying, there are reporters outside.

488
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:48,840
I got it.

489
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,719
Mom, I'm going to receive them.

490
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:53,719
Okay.

491
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,880
By the way, Qianying, you must act with caution.

492
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:00,800
Don't worry.

493
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,159
Go ahead.

494
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,000
This is the flight lab of Fuhua University.

495
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,000
It's reasonable that there's a plane here.

496
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,000
However,

497
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,760
we can't leave loose ends.

498
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,599
- Blow it up.
- Yes.

499
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,760
Why hasn't Mr. Zeng arrived?

500
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:24,285
Good news.

501
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:28,840
I've verified it's true.

502
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:32,079
Congratulations! Mr. Okayama.

503
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,239
What a shame.

504
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:38,239
My only regret is not catching Mr. Ling Wenyue.

505
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:54,480
Or, we can take a photo of him sending it to me.

506
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:58,150
Then it can endorse my article. Right?

507
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,510
Mr. Okayama,

508
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,119
since you've confirmed it's true,

509
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,039
then keep your words and release me.

510
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:12,000
Miss Meng, you're very trusting.

511
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,280
What do you mean?

512
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,800
Looks like your father,

513
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,519
Secretary General Meng
is more clearheaded than you.

514
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,719
Didn't he say I was not a gentleman
and I wouldn't keep my words?

515
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,599
Miss Meng, let me tell you the truth,

516
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,000
now your father, Secretary General Meng may be...

517
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,119
Okayama Shinichi,

518
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,800
you're a scholar.

519
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,840
But you're base.

520
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,480
Base?

521
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:19,460

522
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:27,360
