[Defying the Storm]

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,439
Zhang Qi.

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,280
You look preoccupied.

5
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,959
Anything wrong?

6
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,319
Mr. Meng.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,319
Mrs. Meng.

8
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,280
Haitang and I broke off our engagement

9
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,439
but still fell in love with each other.

10
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,920
Thank you for not hating my illness.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,799
You never object.

12
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,439
But if I don't tell you my decision,

13
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
I will feel guilty.

14
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,000
What do you want to do?

15
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,039
I'm going to have an operation

16
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,199
to remove the bullet.

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,280
Qi.

18
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,759
I have some doctor friends.

19
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
As far as I know,

20
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,439
this surgical technique is immature.

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,639
If the operation fails,

22
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,840
you may be paralyzed

23
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,879
or even life-threatening.

24
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,159
Zhang Qi.

25
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,000
You shouldn't have this operation.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
You will recover slowly.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,680
Yes, she's right.

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,479
You're young.

29
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,400
You'll recover slowly.

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,120
But if you risk to have the operation for Haitang,

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,719
I won't agree.

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,199
In fact,

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,919
to be honest,

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,680
we feel at ease since you can't pilot.

35
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,080
I have the same idea.

36
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,560
Qi.

37
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,599
Your parents gave you everything.

38
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,240
Mr. Meng.

39
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,479
Don't tell my father.

40
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,280
I made my decision after careful consideration.

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Now our country is in peril.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,560
When a bird's nest is overturned,
no egg can remain intact.

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,520
My life mission is to sacrifice for my country.

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,080
However,

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,479
I don't want Haitang to be the same as Yuanyin.

46
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,960
Are you feeling bad again?

47
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,039
I'm fine.

48
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I'll get better.

49
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,479
Qi.

50
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,800
If you must have the operation,

51
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,039
you must inform your father.

52
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,840
You must let him know.

53
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,039
Yes.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,199
The person I worry about most is my father.

55
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,860
But it's hard to achieve both loyalty and filial piety.

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
I'm ashamed that I can't be filial to my parents.

57
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,560
So I never tell them the truth.

58
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,360
But even if I die,

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,600
my brother and sister can take care of them.

60
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,839
As for Haitang,

61
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,639
If I can't wake up,

62
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,279
accompany her and help her restart her life.

63
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,199
Got it.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,399
You mainly want to recover your health

65
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,000
and be able to fly planes again to protect our country.

66
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,199
It's a good idea.

67
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,920
But Qi.

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,920
Can you think from the perspective of your parents?

69
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,879
Master.

70
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,439
How to calculate Planck constant

71
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,360
in Heisenberg uncertainty principle?

72
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,560
Could you teach me?

73
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,439
Come in.

74
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,839
Meng.

75
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
You're all here?

76
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,800
Mr. Ling.

77
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,959
Here you come.

78
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,190
What are you talking about?

79
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,639
Luckily, you come.

80
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,959
Let me persuade Zhang Qi.

81
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,959
He's showing his righteousness

82
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,759
and ambition to serve the country.

83
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,800
I can't persuade him.

84
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,439
OK. Thanks.

85
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Have a chat.

86
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,519
Let me get some water.

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,279
OK.

88
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,319
I think Zhang Qi is cautious in words

89
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,160
and quick in action.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,319
He wants to remove the bullet through the operation.

91
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,480
But as far as I know,

92
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,040
the surgical technique is immature.

93
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,000
He'll risk his life.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Really?

95
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,600
It's a good idea that

96
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,279
he wants to get better

97
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,720
so as to pilot again and protect our country.

98
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,319
Qi.

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,040
This is not the only way to protect our country.

100
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,240
Fuhua University, namely, your teacher, Mr. Zeng,

101
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,519
wants to restart his major in aerodynamics.

102
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,079
With your ability and knowledge,

103
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,079
you can be a teacher

104
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,360
and train more aviation talents for the country.

105
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,759
It's also an important way to protect our country.

106
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,639
Right?

107
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,519
No need to fly planes.

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Mr. Meng.

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,439
Mr. Ling.

110
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,079
I am ashamed to show off my incompetence.

111
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,720
I think it is a long way to save the country
through education.

112
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,959
We must pay attention to national inheritance.

113
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,800
But now the country is in great trouble.

114
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,240
Disasters can happen at any time.

115
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,600
If you want to turn the tide,
you must resort to force.

116
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,425
Although after joining the army,

117
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,310
the pain and war followed me like death,

118
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,800
I'd rather challenge death than surrender to it.

119
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,279
Throughout history,

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
if the weakness of the nation is caused by
the weakness of individuals,

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,680
the whole country will be bullied.

122
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,519
Master.

123
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,519
What have I taught?

124
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:48,879
Here.

125
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,480
It has to be done with this formula.

126
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,199
What Zhang Qi said just now

127
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,240
reminds me of the different views of the KMT

128
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
and the Communist Party on the Anti-Japanese policy.

129
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,600
The KMT advocates internal pacification
before external resistance.

130
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,560
The Communist Party advocates

131
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,560
uniting all forces that can be united.

132
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,759
We must fight even if we're weak.

133
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,439
Meng, I support it.

134
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,079
Ling Wenyue.

135
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,360
I want you to talk him out of the operation.

136
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,199
But I think you support him.

137
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Take it easy.

138
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,399
I have more to say.

139
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,120
Speak.

140
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,600
Since Fuhua was bombed,

141
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,199
I've thought a lot.

142
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,919
I thought that although the Japanese were rampant,

143
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,639
they dare not bomb our school

144
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
because of the constraints of international law.

145
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,879
But they arrived.

146
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,960
They directly attacked Fuhua.

147
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,320
What does it mean?

148
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,000
It shows that they fear our idea of saving
the country through education.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
So they bombed our school.

150
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:52,799
Yes.

151
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,559
Soldiers charge on the front line.

152
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,639
It's a battlefield.

153
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,159
But education is also a battlefield.

154
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,200
Yes.

155
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,120
They bombed our school

156
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,480
because they're afraid of our culture.

157
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,200
More importantly,

158
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,960
They want to destroy our will

159
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,559
to unite in the war of resistance.

160
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,440
So I want to persuade him not to have the operation.

161
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,039
Teaching is also a way to strengthen our country.

162
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,080
Think carefully.

163
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,720
What would have happened

164
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,840
if Zhang Qi, Poshan and Nianqiao
hadn't piloted the planes

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,720
to defend when the enemy bombed?

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,879
I'm afraid not only Poshan will die,

167
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,639
but also thousands of people will be buried
in the sea of fire.

168
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,320
One more thing.

169
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:40,440
It's been ten years since the September 18th Incident.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,440
The KMT government has not declared war on Japan.

171
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,639
Coward!

172
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,799
Cowardice is the root cause of our failure step by step

173
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,320
in the past decade.

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,480
Look at the Communist Party's opinion.

175
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,000
Unite all forces that can be united in the war
of resistance against Japan.

176
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,799
Our young people responded to this call

177
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,799
and actively participated in the front-line war
against Japan.

178
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,879
You want me to help you persuade Zhang Qi.

179
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,519
Now I want to stand with Zhang Qi and persuade you.

180
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,440
He is right.

181
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,919
Many examples at all times and in all over the world

182
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,159
have proved that as long as a country

183
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,399
keeps courage and uprigtness,

184
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,159
even if it is temporarily defeated,

185
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,080
there's still chance of rejuvenation.

186
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,519
As long as a country is afraid of fighting,
it will certainly be defeated,

187
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,159
and there is no chance of rejuvenation.

188
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,879
We'll all die.

189
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,559
As long as we have value,

190
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,720
the life length doesn't matter.

191
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,519
I'm just a scholar.

192
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,159
I'm old.

193
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,440
If the time goes back 30 years,

194
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,000
I will join them in the front-line battle.

195
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,039
I even hope to fly a plane

196
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,320
and beat the invaders to pieces to end the war.

197
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,080
Great.

198
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,720
If they want to attack, we must fight.

199
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,879
In a word, fighting.

200
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,960
Yes.

201
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,799
One more thing.

202
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,960
Haichen submitted a suspension application
to the school today.

203
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,240
He has passed the 14th examination of
the Air Force Officer School.

204
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,080
What?

205
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,679
What a good boy!

206
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,080
China now has tens of thousands of
young people like him

207
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,799
who are actively engaged in the front-line battle
against the enemy.

208
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,279
Meng.

209
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,279
This upsurge cannot be stopped.

210
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,360
What we can do is to support them,

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,240
send them to the battlefield

212
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,000
and wait for their triumph.

213
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,240
Meng, do you think so?

214
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
Let me see.

215
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
Nice.

216
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,720
Now it is certain that Xiao Hong'en

217
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
handed the manuscript of
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar by Ling Wenyue

218
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
to the subordinate of Lu Ziyi,

219
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,159
director of Political Discipline Department.

220
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,159
I saw him at Nanjing Institute of Beiji Pavilion.

221
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,879
And he's responsible for Jin's death.

222
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,919
If he only wants oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

223
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,799
we can't tell if he colludes with
the Kuomintang government

224
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,879
or Japan.

225
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,360
But he always stops Mr. Ling from finishing

226
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,679
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

227
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,879
We think he's in cahoots with the Japanese.

228
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,360
I agree.

229
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,720
I saw Lu Ziyi at Beiji Pavilion.

230
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,600
He said he would get back oracle bone
inscriptions of Wuding for Chongqing.

231
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,559
He also told Xiao Hong'en.

232
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,240
But I don't think so.

233
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,639
He used to purchase smuggled oracle bones
for the Japanese.

234
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,240
So I think he's supported by the Japanese this time.

235
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,120
Mr. Wan.

236
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,879
Could you give Xiao Hong'en one more chance?

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,639
Although he has done some shameful deeds

238
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,559
for the central government,

239
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,120
he is not really working for the Japanese.

240
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,440
And I think we can know more

241
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,840
about the origin of the people who persecuted
Xiao Hong'en behind his back.

242
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,039
Zhenzhu.

243
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
As for Xiao Hong'en,

244
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,279
I hope you can stand your ground.

245
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,240
OK.

246
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,279
I'll deal with it.

247
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,080
Nianqiao.

248
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:13,960
Lieutenant Li.

249
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,120
Why are you here?

250
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,159
I'm sorry for Poshan, too.

251
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,039
I want to see you

252
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,200
and tell you something.

253
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,559
Thank you.

254
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,480
But shall we talk tomorrow?

255
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,399
I'm in a hurry to give this document to the captain.

256
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,399
What document?

257
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,759
Miss Bai has been looking for an operation plan

258
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,519
that can treat the captain abroad.

259
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,639
There's an article
about artificial heart-lung machines.

260
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,519
Maybe it's useful.

261
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,759
It is said that the bullet in Zhang Qi's body
can't be removed.

262
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,200
The operation will kill him.

263
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,840
Why do you encourage him to have it?

264
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,000
I think Miss Bai is right.

265
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,639
As his friend and teammate,

266
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,960
I should give him useful information

267
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,399
and let himself decide
whether he should or can have the operation.

268
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,759
Poshan's death is a great blow to the captain.

269
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,960
He's an eagle.

270
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,759
He doesn't want to lose his wings forever.

271
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,000
Sorry, I can't say more.

272
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,360
Nianqiao.

273
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,120
Do you have any further consideration?

274
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,080
What?

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
Let's make it clear.

276
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,360
The Japanese army will not let Kunming go.

277
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,879
In the whole Wujiaba,

278
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,240
your squadron is the only remaining combat power.

279
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,120
You have four Hawk III.

280
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,000
But how many planes can you keep in the next battle?

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,200
What do you want to say?

282
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,039
Nianqiao.

283
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,000
I like you.

284
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,799
I've asked my father to write a letter to Minister Tang.

285
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,840
As long as you want,

286
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,480
you can immediately transfer
from the squadron of fighter plane

287
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,200
to become a combat staff officer.

288
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:03,879
Or...

289
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,000
If you really want to fly a plane,

290
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,960
go to the transportation brigade.

291
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,720
You mean,

292
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,960
you don't want me to fight?

293
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,600
Nianqiao.

294
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,840
I don't want to be a second Xu Yuanyin.

295
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,200
Have you ever thought

296
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,960
that you were lucky to survive the last battle?

297
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,320
But how much luck can you have?

298
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,440
I love you.

299
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,440
Please stay alive.

300
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,519
Will you live with me?

301
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,360
Lieutenant Li.

302
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,320
Thank you.

303
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,799
Thank you.

304
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,720
My life has long been dedicated

305
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,039
to this troubled country.

306
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,960
Sorry, I have to find the captain.

307
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,279
Press briefing on 22th April, 1941.

308
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,720
Fuzhou was occupied by the 48th division
of the Japanese army.

309
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,240
The National Defense Industry Commission

310
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,039
canceled the decision of the Executive Yuan

311
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,839
and decided that the government should
develop Yumen oil mine

312
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,960
to meet wartime military needs.

313
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,559
Mr. Shao.

314
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,640
As for the business of Yumen oil mine,

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,720
Since the Executive Yuan has canceled the investment
invitation of 120 million silver dollars

316
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,319
and asked the government to run it,

317
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:51,039
will me get...no benefit from it at all?

318
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,720
We must guard the Jing'an oil field in northern Myanmar.

319
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,400
Our share of direct fuel cannot be reduced any more.

320
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,680
It's getting harder and harder to make a little money.

321
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,960
[Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar, Part 2]

322
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,720
Mister.

323
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,759
We must be careful recently.

324
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,519
Should we look for oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding?

325
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,079
Getting Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

326
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,960
is a great help to Okayama.

327
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
We'll make a lot of money.

328
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,079
Shall we stop?

329
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,359
The Bureau of Census of Military Commission

330
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,640
has been very vicious recently.

331
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,440
Their first task is to kill the military

332
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,480
and political personnel
who have surrendered to Japan.

333
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,480
I'm from National Rejuvenation Society.

334
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,599
I know their methods best.

335
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,799
You want to stop because of fear?

336
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,559
No.

337
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,599
What do you mean?

338
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,759
Mr. Xu.

339
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,759
There is no turning back when you bow.

340
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,079
You need to know your family status.

341
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,480
You live in your wife's house.

342
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,640
The money you earn is not enough for your wife

343
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,720
to play Mahjong in Shanghai.

344
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,000
Do you want to stop?

345
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,960
Don't you want to get the oil field
in northern Myanmar?

346
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,359
Mister.

347
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,880
I don't mean that.

348
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,480
Since you appreciate me,

349
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,920
I'll follow you through ups and downs.

350
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,920
But the situation has been tense recently.

351
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,519
We have to find a way out.

352
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,680
We shouldn't fight recklessly.

353
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,720
Xu, besiege Wei to rescue Zhao.

354
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,680
Investigate Hanguang Squadron.

355
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,759
Falsely accuse them of violating discipline and laws,

356
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,359
and colluding with the Communist Party.

357
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,160
First, deal with Zhang Qi.

358
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,319
Pull this nail out for me.

359
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,000
Even if you fail,

360
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,400
you can still divert attention.

361
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,680
Muddling the water is what you should do.

362
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,960
I see.

363
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,359
News!

364
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,039
News!

365
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:42,519
I'm coming.

366
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,640

367
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,720
On June 5th,

368
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,759
24 Japanese planes bombed Chongqing.

369
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,839
The great tunnel tragedy

370
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,839
caused more than 1000 people to suffocate and die.

371
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,440
News!

372
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,759
24 Japanese planes bombed Chongqing.

373
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,920
More than 1000 people died in the tunnel.

374
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,200
Japanese army...

375
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,319
Here you are, sir.

376
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
News!

377
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
On June 5th,

378
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
24 Japanese planes bombed Chongqing.

379
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,920
More than 1000 people died in the tunnel.

380
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,559
News!

381
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,599
Why does Aviation Council directly ask
Zhang Qi to retire?

382
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,680
Report!

383
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,799
Come in.

384
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,000
Minister.

385
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,400
A new order from Aviation Council.

386
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,480
What?

387
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,079
An unwarranted report.

388
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,400
Temporarily revoke the designation of Hanguang

389
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,240
and let the team members wait for investigation?

390
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,039
They're going too far!

391
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,920
They turn a blind eye on me?

392
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,279
Minister.

393
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,240
I've got the news.

394
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,400
It's a new plot of Political Discipline Department.

395
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,720
Higher authorities sent you a pending notice

396
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,759
because they care about your identity.

397
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,640
Identity?

398
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,839
Since Lu Ziyi came to Aviation School,

399
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,319
he's never stopped making trouble.

400
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,920
He almost slaps me in the face.

401
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,799
Does he want to play a game?

402
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,240
OK.

403
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,599
Well.

404
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,119
Where's Zhang Qi?

405
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,799
Someone has been sent to invite Captain Zhang back.

406
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,839
One more thing.

407
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,559
There's a Mr. Zhang back from southeast Asia
waiting for you.

408
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,519
Mr. Zhang?

409
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,559
Who?

410
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,319
Mr. Zhang Buchun,
President of Overseas Chinese Association.

411
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:29,839
Let him in.

412
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,480
Yes.

413
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,559
Mr. Zhang.

414
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,079
Sorry for the poor reception.

415
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,039
Take a seat.

416
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,359
OK. Thank you.

417
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,799
Minister Tang.

418
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,039
Excuse me.

419
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,400
I just arrived in Kunming and came to bother you.

420
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,839
Mr. Zhang.

421
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,599
Don't say that.

422
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,799
The last time I saw you was on the chairman's birthday.

423
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,079
Looking at you from afar,

424
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,960
I admired you very much.

425
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,680
I didn't expect that you came here years later.

426
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,799
It's my pleasure.

427
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,759
Thank you.

428
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,720
Minister Tang.

429
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,720
I'm here to thank you.

430
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,359
Thank you for your care and support

431
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,839
for Zhang Qi over the years.

432
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,240
By the way,

433
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,960
I came to Kunming this time

434
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,200
to deal with the import of aviation fuel.

435
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,920
Mr. Zhang.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
The fuel really matters.

437
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,759
Thank you very much.

438
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,720
I'll try my best.

439
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,799
By the way,

440
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,200
I have a small request.

441
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,079
Please do me a favor.

442
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,680
Mr. Zhang.

443
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,200
You're welcome.

444
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,200
Certainly, it's about Zhang Qi.

445
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,039
The order of the Aviation Commission

446
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,680
to ask Zhang Qi to retire is really rude.

447
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,160
But after all, he has made military achievements.

448
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Don't worry. I...

449
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,279
Minister.

450
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,799
The decision of the Aviation Commission
is also my request.

451
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,519
I hope you can approve Zhang Qi's retirement.

452
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,359
Young Master, here you come.

453
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,799
Master is waiting for you.

454
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,920
Dad.

455
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,759
It's you!

456
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,599
Nianqiao said you would be back tomorrow.

457
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,880
I'm going to pick you up.

458
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,720
Qi.

459
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,279
You got injured two years ago.

460
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,680
Why are you still so haggard after such a long time?

461
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,039
Dad.

462
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:34,880
I'm fine.

463
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,400
Kneel down.

464
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,960
Articles 3 and 5 of family instructions.

465
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,480
Article 3.

466
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,799
Cherish your life and save your reputation.

467
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,119
Don't let parents worry.

468
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,319
Article 5.

469
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,640
Serve the country

470
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,240
and bring happiness to family.

471
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:04,880
Stand up.

472
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,160
Sit down.

473
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,799
OK.

474
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,000
You still remember that.

475
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,039
Let me ask you.

476
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,680
Your body is given by parents.

477
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,519
It shouldn't be damaged.

478
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,000
This is the beginning of filial piety.

479
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,200
What did you do?

480
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,359
And...

481
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,240
What does bringing happiness to family mean?

482
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,240
Since you went to the military school in America,

483
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,599
your grandpa, the whole family and I

484
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,319
have been very worried about you.

485
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,519
But we know you went out to study

486
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,039
so as to serve the country.

487
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,599
So we never disturb you.

488
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,599
Later,

489
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,079
you returned to join the air force.

490
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,440
I could only call Ding Huansheng to learn about you.

491
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,359
After Huansheng died,

492
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,599
it's Zeng Nianqiao who wrote to me,

493
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,960
telling me that you were safe.

494
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,240
Do you know

495
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,119
your grandpa got the letter,

496
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,319
read it over and over again

497
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,480
for a long time,

498
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,559
and then he was in a daze?

499
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,039
Finally,

500
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,039
he pretended that nothing happened

501
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,279
and asked us not to disturb you.

502
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:23,720
But what did you do?

503
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,359
Why have you never written to us?

504
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,319
Why?

505
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,319
Dad.

506
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,960
The motherland is in ruins.

507
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,079
I've decided to serve my country

508
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,440
since the day I left home.

509
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,400
I didn't write letters

510
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,799
because I wanted my family to gradually forget me.

511
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,480
In this way, even if I die one day,

512
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,920
you don't have to be too sad.

513
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:57,960
Naive!

514
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:03,920
Even if you don't write to us,

515
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,319
we won't forget you.

516
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,359
Our hearts are connected.

517
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,720
That just makes us more worried.

518
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,559
Understand?

519
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,319
Qi.

520
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,440
You've done your best for our country.

521
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,160
You are now covered with injuries.

522
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,480
Don't strive for bubble reputation of a hero

523
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,640
or risk your life.

524
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,640
I've got along with the Kuomintang government
for years.

525
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,000
I know them better.

526
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:43,720
I know more about current politics than you do.

527
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:51,160
Let's talk about the purchase of aircraft
by the air force.

528
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,200
I donated two Fuxing Aircraft before.

529
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,440
It cost me a lot of money.

530
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,920
But do you know where the money went?

531
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,799
You mean...

532
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,200
Let's talk about the order of September, 1936.

533
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,920
A total of 70 aircraft,

534
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,440
including 26 British aircraft

535
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,839
and 44 French aircraft.

536
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,440
These planes cost twice as much as

537
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,559
those in the Soviet Union and are paid in full.

538
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,759
But do you know

539
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,079
that it was not until 1937

540
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,240
that these 70 planes were transported back to China?

541
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,519
Do you know what happened then?

542
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,759
So are the previous batch of Italian planes.

543
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,480
Qi.

544
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,359
You young people are doing your best

545
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,759
to serve the motherland on the front line.

546
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,960
But what about others?

547
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,119
They embezzle in the rear.

548
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,200
You can't wake them up.

549
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,759
You can't wake up those who pretend to sleep.

550
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:55,000
You can't wake up those who don't want to wake up at all.

551
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,640
Listen.

552
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,519
You young people cannot save this turbulent country.

553
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,079
Dad.

554
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,119
Xinzhi Times said

555
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
you provided oil refining equipment to
Yumen Oilfield

556
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,079
to provide fuel for fighters.

557
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:18,160
You also want to serve the country.

558
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,920
Why not let me fulfill this wish for you?

559
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,839
There are many ways to serve the country.

560
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,079
You don't have to sacrifice.

561
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,039
I've told Minister Tang

562
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,519
I can donate two new Russian fighters

563
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,720
but you must retire.

564
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,160
Dad.

565
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,279
Since I got injured,

566
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,440
there's been no leader in the squadron.

567
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,400
Zeng Poshan died in the sky on his wedding day

568
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,440
because I couldn't fly.

569
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,599
And his wife also died after his death.

570
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,039
How can I drag out an ignoble existence?

571
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,039
Instruction of Aviation Council.

572
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,559
You shall retire.

573
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,880
And I signed.

574
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,279
Minister.

575
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,319
I apply to take off as a leader.

576
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,920
Please approve my request.

577
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,599
Take off?

578
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,440
Can you fly?

579
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:37,200
I'll have the bullet removed.

580
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,000
So I'll be able to take off.

581
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,279
What operation?

582
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,000
You've had countless operations
in the past three years.

583
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,240
It's a miracle that you can stand here.

584
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,160
Accept it.

585
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,880
Go back with your father.

586
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
As a soldier,

587
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,920
you have done your duty.

588
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,319
Go back and live a peaceful life.

589
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,759
There is no peace in the world.

590
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,640
How can I enjoy peace alone?

591
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,799
I must have the operation.

592
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,720
After removing the bullet,

593
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,839
I can return to the sky

594
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,240
and lead my squadron

595
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,440
to defend the enemy again.

596
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,960
Zhang Qi, you did a good job.

597
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,079
Our squadron...

598
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,720
Do you know that our squadron has been canceled?

599
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,200
What?

600
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,759
The instruction sent by Aviation Council yesterday.

601
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,359
Take a walk with me.

602
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:55,960
Minister.

603
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,640
Keep running.

604
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:58,799
Yes.

605
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,839
They remind me of you in the past.

606
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,920
When you just came here,

607
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,720
you were also a little boy.

608
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,920
6 years have passed.

609
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:13,680
Yes.

610
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,279
How time flies!

611
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,680
I always hope that you can return to the sky.

612
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,680
In fact, as a minister,

613
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,720
some words shouldn't be said by me.

614
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,079
I'm happy that you survive.

615
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,920
I'm sorry that you can't fly anymore.

616
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,359
But in addition to regret,

617
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,200
I'm very glad that,

618
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,160
at least,

619
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,119
you did not sacrifice like Huansheng and Poshan.

620
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,400
I don't want to receive your death notice.

621
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,319
Zhang Qi.

622
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
I'm your teacher and friend.

623
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,599
Aviation Council gave the order.

624
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,000
And your father came to Kunming in person.

625
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,400
That also solves many difficulties in my heart.

626
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Be a good boy. Live a good life in a new way.

627
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,119
Minister.

628
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,319
I know you care about me.

629
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,519
But have you forgotten how your wife died?

630
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,920
Tang Shengzhi left Nanjing behind and fled.

631
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,519
Your wife was killed in a bombing
on her way to escape Nanjing.

632
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,160
I know you vowed to live or die with China.

633
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,240
Since you made such a decision,

634
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,640
how can you ask me to be a deserter?

635
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:39,799
Zhang Qi.

636
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,079
Are you determined

637
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
to run counter to Aviation Council and your father?

638
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,359
Please let me stay.

639
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,559
OK.

640
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,359
I can give you a chance.

641
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,920
After Zeng Poshan died,

642
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,920
Xishan was seriously damaged.

643
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,359
If you fix Xishan in a week,

644
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,279
I'll approve your operation.

645
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,839
If you survive the operation,

646
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,759
I'll support you in front of Aviation Council.

647
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,360
Lu Ziyi wants to dismiss Hanguang.

648
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,039
No way!

649
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,039
Listen.

650
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,800
I'll check it a week later.

651
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,079
If Xishan fails to take off,

652
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,920
you should retire and leave.

653
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,920
Yes.

654
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,320
How's it going?

655
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,519
Done.

656
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,199
We need a machine gun.

657
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,320
Machine gun...

658
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,119
Machine gun...

659
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,239
Minister.

660
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,159
According to your order,

661
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,400
all machinery factories and other brigades

662
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,960
will not hand over surplus machine guns to Zhang Qi.

663
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,320
Just one day left.

664
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,440
He can't finish the task.

665
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,280
Thank you.

666
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:14,480
The air force came to our army territory to rob things?

667
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,920
You want to take away our guns?

668
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,719
Report.

669
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,559
Our army received a batch of weapons a few days ago.

670
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
Some of them were removed from aircraft.

671
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:28,079
So was this 7.62-caliber machine gun.

672
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,239
We don't need it.

673
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,400
Return to them.

674
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,400
Return?

675
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,519
I lost my big house in Hukou.

676
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,559
But no one returns the house.

677
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,119
How dare the air force show off in front of our army?

678
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,199
Just because your pay is twice as high as ours?

679
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,199
If you want this gun,

680
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,239
get my permission first.

681
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,840
What do you want to do?

682
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,199
I don't like you young air force.

683
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,920
It's said that you pilots are able to wield
both the pen and the gun.

684
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,920
Let me see your skills.

685
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,039
If you win, you shall take away the gun.

686
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,840
If you lose, call me grandfather thrice

687
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,199
and then take away the gun.

688
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,599
OK?

689
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,880
Great!

690
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,480
Do you admit your loss?

691
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,360
Great!

692
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,079
You can't defeat me.

693
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,480
Call me grandfather thrice

694
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,840
and you shall take away the gun.

695
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,199
Yes!

696
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,800
Call him grandfather!

697
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,159
Call him grandfather!

698
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,039
Call him grandfather!

699
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,360
Great!

700
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,719
Young man.

701
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,119
Why must you get this gun?

702
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,840
Aren't you afraid of death?

703
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,039
It's our captain who's not afraid of death!

704
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,599
There's a bullet in his heart that can't be removed.

705
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,519
But he still wants to fight against the Japanese in the sky!

706
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,039
We managed to fix a plane.

707
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,559
We just need a machine gun.

708
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,719
You don't have to call me grandfather.

709
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,000
Just admit your loss

710
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,239
and take away the gun.

711
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,039
Yes. Admit the loss.

712
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,519
Admit your loss. Stop fighting.

713
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,760
Or you'll die.

714
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,320
No!

715
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,960
Win or die!

716
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,519
I never learn admitting the loss!

717
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,800
Come on!

718
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,639
It's a draw.

719
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,159
Take away the gun.

720
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:28,760
Follow me.

721
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,039
12.7 mm caliber.

722
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,559
Standard configuration of Hawker III.

723
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,519
It's just been shipped from Chongqing.

724
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,480
It's said that it was in Wuhan

725
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,519
and was shipped to Jiangyin.

726
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,840
It was removed from a crashed destroyer.

727
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:04,760
Jiangyin?

728
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,679
Jiangyin.

729
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,800
It was installed on a fighter in Jiangyin

730
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,000
and shot a Japanese plane.

731
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,199
The fighter crashed

732
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,239
so the gun was removed again

733
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,039
and sent to Kunming.

734
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,519
Our army doesn't need it.

735
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,280
If you want,

736
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:23,679
take it away.

737
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,079
Thank you.

738
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,320
Tell your captain

739
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,800
I admire him very much.

740
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,159
You beat Japanese in the sky.

741
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,039
we beat them on the ground.

742
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,480
Just a mater of life and death.

743
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,920
Fight until the end!

744
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,159
Captain.

745
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,079
Minister.

746
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,320
We have a gun.

747
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,119
Zhang Qi.

748
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,639
Well done.

749
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,679
Well, you win.

750
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,360
You have my permission.

00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:08,100
