[Episode 11]

4
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,439
Stay there.

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,920
Let me see.

6
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,359
You have a fever.

7
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,239
Shall we see...

8
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,439
Zhang Qi, screwdriver.

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,719
Coming.

10
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,480
Here you are.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,640
Thanks.

12
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,240
It's for you guys.

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Thank you.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,240
What are you waiting for?

15
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,840
Maybe we should wait for the captain.

16
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,520
No need.

17
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:16,759
I made it for you.

18
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,520
No need to wait for him.

19
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,599
Go ahead.

20
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,159
Is it good?

21
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,439
Very nice.

22
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,479
Then have more.

23
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,759
Captain.

24
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
The room smells full of vinegar.

25
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm saying this with a stuffed nose.

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,159
Captain, your Haitang flower dropped by.

27
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,680
She made soup for you.

28
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,840
She's here?

29
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,919
Where is she now?

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,080
She left.

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
You were too intimate with Miss Zhenzhu.

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,879
Maybe she's crying over it right now.

33
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,400
Long Zhenzhu?

34
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,479
I see her as a brother.

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,639
Don't be stupid.

36
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,439
She made this?

37
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,439
Well, in this case...

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,840
let's share it.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,759
It's too much for me.

40
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,240
We've already had it.

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,879
Have you?

42
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,719
Is it good?

43
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,840
Yes, have a taste.

44
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,919
Well, captain, nice, huh?

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,280
How do you like it?

46
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,839
Appetizing.

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,040
I like it.

48
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,560
You do?

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,279
Have more.

50
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,980
Captain.

51
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,300
This Haitang flower must be very special.

52
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,439
Indeed.

53
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,160
All of you have had piloted a plane,

54
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,279
but never had a parachuting class.

55
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,839
Now Officer Li will give a demonstration.

56
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,959
Hey, dude.

57
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,639
Can you hear me?

58
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,800
Stay with me.

59
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,199
We'll get to the hospital soon.

60
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,560
30 seconds.

61
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,839
45 seconds.

62
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,600
One minute.

63
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,040
Hold on.

64
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,519
Why are you laughing?

65
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,279
This is a waste of time.

66
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,279
When speaking to an officer,

67
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,079
start with Sir or Madam.

68
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Madam, I think this is a waste of time.

69
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,399
Once detached from the aircraft,

70
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,120
pilots are the most vulnerable objects in the air.

71
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,839
Whether your enemy fire or not

72
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,959
depends solely on his humanity.

73
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,040
You're learning this to save your own life.

74
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,639
Sir, I don't think so.

75
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,199
By then, there will be no need to hold on.

76
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,360
Live or die together with the plane,

77
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,240
says the school's motto.

78
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,839
Officer Li, ultimately, wars are fought by men.

79
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
Live or die with the plane.

80
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,839
It is meant to tell you newbies to not

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,160
make sacrifices in vain.

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,480
If the plane is destroyed,

83
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,879
a living soldier can still fight the enemy.

84
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,279
Apologize to Officer Li for your imprudence.

85
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,639
Officer Zeng, I come here to learn fighting in the air

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,240
so that I can take revenge on enemy.

87
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,839
And I mean it.

88
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,279
I'm willing to have a fight with Officer Li.

89
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,839
If she wins, I'll apologize.

90
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,079
Officer Zeng, what do you think?

91
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,079
Okay.

92
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,879
Teach him a lesson.

93
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,319
Everybody, fall in.

94
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,360
Excuse me, Officer Li.

95
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,519
Well?

96
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,319
Zeng Poshan, wars are fought by women as well.

97
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,519
In a real battle,

98
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,879
only one side can survive.

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Take note of it.

100
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,600
Where are you from?

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
How did you get in?

102
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,720
Officer Li...this is Meng Haichen.

103
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,960
He's here to see the captain.

104
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,679
Haichen, why don't you go in?

105
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,799
My sister is in there.

106
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,279
Oh I know.

107
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,799
You're the student Captain Zhang saved.

108
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,600
One of the 29th Military Academy Corps.

109
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,960
Yes, I'm only a student.

110
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,960
Excuse me.

111
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,639
You were a soldier.

112
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,759
Look alive.

113
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,039
Head up.

114
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,080
The boy hasn't been himself

115
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,440
ever since he was saved.

116
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,360
Because he is a student.

117
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,159
Poshan is impudent.

118
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,879
He is weak.

119
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,879
They can't face a real war,

120
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,879
and will be a shame of soldiers.

121
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,559
Officer Li, give them time.

122
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,559
They're students.

123
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,320
They're also young patriots,

124
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,919
who stand ready to fight for their country.

125
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,360
Otherwise, they wouldn't have volunteered to join us.

126
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,200
You don't learn how to face a war in school,

127
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,320
but in the battlefield from the enemy.

128
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,799
The way I see it, none of them can compare with you.

129
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,159
Courageous, resourceful, always composed.

130
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,200
You're flattering me.

131
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,399
I'm just older and have learned more than them.

132
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,960
I have to talk with him sometime.

133
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,120
Uncle!

134
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,360
Aunt!

135
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,320
Uncle Ling!

136
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Good news!

137
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,360
Why is he so excited?

138
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,639
Uncle, uncle Ling,

139
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,120
have you listened to the radio?

140
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,360
No, why?

141
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,879
Turn on the radio.

142
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,000
The Central News Agency will rebroadcast it.

143
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,799
Rebroadcast what?

144
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,240
You'll find out in a minute.

145
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,399
Good news.

146
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,919
Dear compatriots,

147
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,720
with great enthusiasm, the central committee

148
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,039
of the Communist Party of China

149
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,759
declares to our fellow brothers and sisters.

150
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,200
At a time of national crisis, our people are in great peril.

151
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,159
To save the Chinese nation from destruction,

152
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,440
on the basis of peaceful reunification and united resistance,

153
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,000
we have reached an understanding with
the Chinese Nationalist Party.

154
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,639
We will work together to save our nation.

155
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,960
This understanding is of great significance

156
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,799
to the future of the Chinese nation.

157
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,480
The Communist Party of China will now

158
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,000
declare the ultimate goal we strive for to our compatriots.

159
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,399
It is to strive for the independence, freedom and liberation

160
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,240
of the Chinese nation.

161
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,799
Firstly, we need to faithfully and rapidly

162
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,200
prepare and launch national revolution

163
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,679
to regain lost territory and restore the integrity
of territory and sovereignty.

164
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,759
We will cancel the name and designation of the Red Army

165
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,039
and be reorganized as
the National Revolutionary Army.

166
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,440
We will be subject to the Military Commission of
the Kuomintang government,

167
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,840
We will act as ordered,

168
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,519
and assume the responsibility of the anti-Japanese front.

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,440
Dear compatriots, let's stand up

170
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
and be united as one.

171
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,799
The great Chinese nation will never yield.

172
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,879
Arise.

173
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,159
Let's strive to consolidate national unity.

174
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,559
Let's strive to overthrow
the oppression of Japanese imperialism.

175
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,399
Victory belongs to the Chinese nation.

176
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
Long live the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

177
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,879
Long live an independent, free, and happy new China.

178
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:45,279
Long live the central committee
of the Communist Party of China.

179
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,519
Long live.

180
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:46,960
That's great.

181
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,200
The CPC sounds very sincere.

182
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,200
The Kuomintang central government
will have to respond to it.

183
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,879
The two Parties will join hands
to fight against the Japanese.

184
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,200
We'll beat the crap out of them.

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,279
If so, it will be a good thing to our country and people.

186
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,039
Again, China will be rescued from desperation.

187
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,320
The Central News Agency released the declaration

188
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,480
in a formal manner today.

189
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,559
It marks the KMT-CPC cooperation.

190
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,360
At the eleventh hour,

191
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,240
we will have to make necessary sacrifice
and fight to the end.

192
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,399
Guys, get ready for the real battle.

193
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,799
Yes, sir.

194
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,360
Another battle is coming.

195
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,320
Captain, as usual,

196
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,799
let's go to the Temple of Yue Fei for good luck.

197
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,919
Meng, do you remember this?

198
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,000
In Beijing, Mr. Jin left two items in the Temple of Guan Yu.

199
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,440
Oracle bones?

200
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,879
Here's a letter.

201
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,720
What does it say?

202
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,519
- Well...
- Weiqi manual?

203
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,080
Those broken oracle bones are fakes,

204
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,679
but that Weiqi manual is quite interesting.

205
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,120
I have studied it after we came back.

206
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,279
And I think it's more than a manual.

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,399
It is a set of codes.

208
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,960
The other day, I visited Professor Ma

209
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,320
of the mathematics department.

210
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,960
I asked for his opinion.

211
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,399
Professor Ma studied it for several days.

212
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,879
He told me the codes might be cracked into four characters.

213
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,159
Jin Zhong Bao Guo.

214
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,919
As we all know,

215
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,799
these four characters are related to general Yue Fei.

216
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,759
There are three temples of Yue Fei nationwide.

217
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,879
Two of them are in Henan province.

218
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,960
Specifically, Tangyin county and Zhuxian town.

219
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,960
However, both temples have it as "Jing" Zhong Bao Guo,

220
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
as in the phrase "Jing Shen".

221
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,120
Only the one in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province

222
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,919
has it as "Jin" Zhong Bao Guo,

223
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,759
as in the phrase "Jin Li".

224
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,519
Therefore, I think Professor Jin left the manual
to tell us that

225
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,200
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

226
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,480
is in the Temple of Yue Fei in Hangzhou.

227
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,879
We should go there to find it.

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,960
The Temple of Yue Fei?

229
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,780
[Three months ago]

230
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,879
Then you should go as soon as possible.

231
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,879
The Man Jiang Hong over there

232
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,080
was written by Wen Huiming

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,720
in the 9th year of Emperor Jia Jing's reign.

234
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,799
At the end of the tablet, it reads

235
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,200
I laugh at Qin Hui,

236
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,119
for he can't have everything he wants.

237
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,119
Does anyone know what it means?

238
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,200
No.

239
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,200
Well, it means that

240
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,240
Qin Hui didn't have enough power

241
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,079
to kill whoever he wanted.

242
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:18,679
So who gave him the power to kill Yue Fei?

243
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,240
It must be a higher organ of power.

244
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,519
Do you agree?

245
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,799
By Ming Dynasty,

246
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,599
Confucianism has shifted to the school of mind.

247
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,480
Where are my dates?

248
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
[Jin Zhong Bao Guo]

249
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,319
Wow, what is that?

250
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,240
A real genius hiding place.

251
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,480
Where is Ling Wenyue?

252
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,359
Let's go check over there.

253
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,680
Okay, let's go.

254
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,039
Sir.

255
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,000
Gentlemen.

256
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,200
Be kind.

257
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,319
Please give me some food.

258
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,640
I've been starving for a long time.

259
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,599
It's not a place for beggars.

260
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,440
Get lost.

261
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,079
Well, in ancient times, philosophers believe that

262
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,920
our behaviors are governed by internal consciousness.

263
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,839
A person who is truly good-hearted

264
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:50,960
will naturally do good deeds.

265
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,039
Isn't that Captain Zhang?

266
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,079
Come on.

267
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,880
I'll see you later.

268
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,519
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,599
Just bring it back.

270
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,759
Somebody will pick it up in a while.

271
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,000
A member of the CPC or not,

272
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,799
the two of us, old and young,

273
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,880
scholar and soldier,

274
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,039
must defend our country in our own way.

275
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,759
We don't have to say it out loud,

276
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,680
but we have to do it.

277
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,920
Haitang, why are we standing here?

278
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,599
We can go over and say hi to captain Zhang.

279
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,079
Does he look slimmer to you?

280
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,039
Well...I can't tell.

281
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,319
Come to think of it,

282
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,839
I was so petty.

283
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,839
He's a soldier.

284
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,880
He doesn't see love the same way as I do.

285
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,480
Maybe all he can think about now

286
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,480
is to serve our country, as it writes on the wall.

287
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,319
Indeed, Poshan also said once

288
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,359
that even in his dream, he want to drive the plane

289
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,839
to drive the Japanese out of our country.

290
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,279
At a time of national crisis,

291
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,640
to save the country is the top priority.

292
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,720
We should do whatever within our scope.

293
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,400
I will serve the country in my own way.

294
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,319
What is that?

295
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,400
Haitang, I think to love them properly

296
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,400
is something within our scope.

297
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,279
Yes, to love them properly.

298
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,839
Right now, our top priority is to study, so we can

299
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,880
be eligible patriots.

300
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,640
Come on.

301
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,640
Director, since Okayama Shinichi said

302
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,759
the one brought to Japan is a fake.

303
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,400
Ling Wenyue must have the real one.

304
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,160
When Ling Wenyue and Meng Wuran come out later,

305
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,799
shall we take them to a quiet place and...

306
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,400
Uncle Ling, I heard you're going to the Institute

307
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
of History and Philology.

308
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,240
Yes, I am.

309
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,400
May I come with you?

310
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,960
I can help you with some of the work, so that

311
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,039
Mrs. Ling can spend time with Qianying.

312
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,000
Please, take me with you.

313
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,319
Director, that's the daughter of Ling Wenyue.

314
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,279
Also lives in Xu Village.

315
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,079
Shall I ask Laosan to distract the two girls or...

316
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,519
Yes, sir.

317
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,079
We won't spare them.

318
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,319
Your rubbing skills are in fact very good now,

319
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,240
better than Qianying's mom.

320
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,319
On October 15th, I plan to go to Nanjing Institute

321
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,480
of History and Philologyon.

322
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:46,759
Rubbing oracle bone inscriptions is hard work.

323
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,720
Can you bear it?

324
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,799
Of course I can.

325
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,599
It can't be harder than the work we did in Anyang, right?

326
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,000
Isn't that Mr. Ling and Haitang?

327
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,039
You really wanna go?

328
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,279
Well, then let's go back and tell your parents first.

329
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,039
Okay?

330
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,599
Okay.

331
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm going to the Institute.

332
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,279
Thank you, uncle Ling.

333
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,359
Let's go.

334
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,440
Director, shall we tail after Hanguang Squadron?

335
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,079
Not today.

336
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,880
But keep an eye on Zeng Nianqiao.

337
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,680
After all, he's Jin Zhilie's student.

338
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,839
Keep a sharp lookout.

339
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,240
I believe there is more to him.

340
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,480
Yes, sir.

341
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,640
Well well well, Yue Wumu,

342
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,720
you died in Fengbo Pavilion after all.

343
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,519
No surrender, no disgrace...

344
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,240
Chief Editor Chen is dedicated to

345
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,079
serving the country with his articles.

346
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,400
He writes it to encourage

347
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:54,400
himself as well as fellow compatriots.

348
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,240
No surrender is a kind of idealism.

349
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
But given the current situation,

350
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,599
I'm afraid that a stubborn chief editor

351
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,359
is not a good thing for our newspaper's development.

352
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,359
I don't think so.

353
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,039
We're Chinese.

354
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,759
We run Chinese newspaper.

355
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,880
As this article says,

356
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,359
no surrender, no disgrace.

357
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,160
He's a journalist of integrity.

358
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,640
I think he's right.

359
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,559
Okay, see you.

360
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,640
Zhenzhu...

361
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,720
The engagement pearl bracelet...

362
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,599
you said you lost it.

363
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,799
It upset me a lot.

364
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,880
So I had the artisan of Shanghai Lao Feng Xing

365
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,720
make this for you.

366
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,720
The black sea pearl in the middle

367
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,720
looks nearly the same with the lost one.

368
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,880
Thank you.

369
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,720
Zhenzhu, marry me.

370
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,759
Be patient.

371
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
I've already promised you a verbal engagement.

372
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,480
Now our country is in great danger,

373
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,920
personal affairs should come next.

374
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,079
Like Zhang Qi and the guys,

375
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,440
saving China is their priority.

376
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,119
They all...

377
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,279
I...I'm talking about us.

378
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,200
What do they have to do with this?

379
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,039
I really need to go.

380
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,359
I'll take Xing Hua Times with me.

381
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,200
For now, I'll continue presiding over

382
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,880
the work of Jianqiao Party branch.

383
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,759
You and Ding Huansheng need to establish
an independent branch

384
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,119
in the aviation school.

385
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,000
You'll be in charge of it.

386
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,359
Okay, I understand.

387
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Dear audiences, attention here.

388
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,880
I'll begin today's storytelling.

389
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,279
In the Warring States period,

390
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,799
there was a major state...

391
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,359
Waiter!

392
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,200
Yes, sir.

393
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,680
Private room?

394
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Yes, sir, upstairs.

395
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,720
Manager Xu.

396
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,839
You like to drink tea?

397
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,720
Please let me invite you to Longjing tea.

398
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,960
Zhang Qi?

399
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,759
What are you doing here?

400
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,000
Captain!

401
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:29,920
What took you so long?

402
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,799
I've been waiting for long.

403
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,960
Nianqiao, what a coincidence.

404
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,720
You offered to treat me with tea.

405
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
So I brought an old friend with me.

406
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,079
Manager Xu, what a pleasant surprise.

407
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:40,680
Please join us.

408
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,519
Tea? Seriously?

409
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,559
Shouldn't you get back to school?

410
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,559
Well, if you don't like tea,

411
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,200
how about Lou Wai Lou across the street?

412
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,880
Manager Xu, do come.

413
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,240
Sounds good.

414
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,119
I heard they make great sweet and sour fish.

415
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,359
Yes, they do.

416
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,559
That's their specialty.

417
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,559
We must go have a taste.

418
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
With some great wine.

419
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,079
Manager Xu, this way.

420
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,559
Their sweet and sour fish is real good.

421
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,440
Is that so?

422
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,119
Absolutely.

423
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,319
Just give it a try.

424
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,480
Coming.

425
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,440
What are you doing here?

426
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,799
You keep postponing marrying me.

427
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,880
Is it because of Zhang Qi?

428
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,720
Have you been tailing after me?

429
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:52,839
Zhenzhu...

430
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,440
Zhenzhu...

431
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,200
Zhenzhu, please let me explain.

432
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,440
So, Manager Xu, how is Lou Wai Lou?

433
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,319
Director, I didn't want to go in the first place.

434
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,880
The sweet and sour fish is too raw.

435
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,319
I thought maybe I could get more information from

436
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,319
Zhang Qi and Zeng Nianqiao.

437
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,720
Did you?

438
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,240
Zeng Nianqiao looks like a good student,

439
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,759
but he drinks like a fish.

440
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,000
I made a momentary oversight,

441
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,880
and got nothing useful.

442
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,000
Maybe you should drink more.

443
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,279
I asked you to keep an eye on Ling Wenyue.

444
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,880
Hanguang Squadron got in the way.

445
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,240
I asked you to tail Zeng Nianqiao.

446
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,400
You ended up drunk.

447
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,079
Two slips in one day.

448
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,279
I'm impressed.

449
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,480
I didn't see it coming.

450
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,839
Who'd have thought Hanguang Squadron

451
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,480
would go to the Temple of Yue Fei?

452
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,160
You can make predictions?

453
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,559
Okay, can you help me see

454
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,440
if Hanguang Squadron is a part of it?

455
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,799
Sir, I've been observing.

456
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,359
They never met in private.

457
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:59,000
Does it mean Hanguang Squadron isn't involved in it?

458
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,000
This Zhang Qi...

459
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,559
Were Hanguang Squadron not a force

460
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,079
fighting against the Japanese,

461
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,480
he would have been dead already.

462
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,799
Jin Zhilie, Ling Wenyue, and Meng Wuran

463
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,880
are all well-known scholars worldwide.

464
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,680
The death of Jin Zhilie is enough trouble for us.

465
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,759
Nothing can happen to the other two.

466
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,960
Director, we can make something happen to them.

467
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,720
We just have to choose a good place,

468
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
so that no one will know we are behind it.

469
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,680
What are you up to?

470
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,480
Let me hear it.

471
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,079
Sir, I heard that on 15th next month,

472
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,880
Ling Wenyue will go to Beiji Pavilion in Nanjing.

473
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,039
Nanjing...a city of turbulence now,

474
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,920
which makes it a perfect place for us.

475
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,240
Dad, come back early.

476
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,319
I'm only going for a couple of days.

477
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,880
Listen to mom at home.

478
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,319
Listen, this is for the trip,

479
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,359
in case you're hungry.

480
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,400
Zhenzhu...

481
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,559
Can't you just send someone to Nanjing

482
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,559
with uncle Ling and Haitang?

483
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,119
You don't necessarily need to go.

484
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,680
You will be gone for several days.

485
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,400
The bombing in Nanjing has been going on for days.

486
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,480
I'm really worried.

487
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:33,079
I need to take the film to Nanjing anyway.

488
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,559
True, I was wrong the last time.

489
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,519
I've apologized.

490
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,759
But you have to know.

491
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,359
It's only because I care too much about you.

492
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,720
Will you forgive me?

493
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,440
I'm not that petty.

494
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,240
Miss Long...

495
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,240
Mr. Meng.

496
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,000
The Japanese army has been bombing Nanjing
for half a month.

497
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,559
A young lady like you

498
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,519
should be taken care of by us.

499
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,279
But now you have to accompany them.

500
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,000
I feel real bad about it.

501
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,039
Mr. Meng, it's my pleasure.

502
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,680
Upon arriving, the Institute will send a car

503
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,480
for Miss Meng and Mr. Ling.

504
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,200
I also have some work in Nanjing.

505
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
So I can be a guide,

506
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,960
showing them around.

507
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,359
Don't worry.

508
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,079
Thank you so much, Miss Long.

509
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,279
Take care.

510
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:29,640
Thank you.

511
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,000
Mr. Ling.

512
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,400
Miss Meng.

513
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,000
Shall we get on the train?

514
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,160
Okay.

515
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,920
Your luggage.

516
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,440
What did your mom pack for you?

517
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Take care.

518
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,720
Take care.

519
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,759
Captain.

520
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,480
I was informed just now.

521
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,279
There will be a bomb attack on Beiji Pavilion

522
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,440
and Nanjing Institute.

523
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,799
Luckily, most of the cultural relics have been moved.

524
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,759
Are you sure it's Beiji Pavilion?

525
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,400
Yes.

526
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,559
Okay?

527
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,200
Okay.

528
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,920
I'm going to the Institute.

529
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,880
Thank you, uncle Ling.

530
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,839
No.

531
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,400
What's wrong?

532
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,559
Mr. Ling and Haitang are in the Institute.

533
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,559
I'm going to take a transporter to go get them.

534
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,599
Shall I come with you?

535
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,000
No, I don't time to wait for you.

536
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,780
[Institute of History and Philology]

537
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
The film is running out.

538
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,519
It's getting late.

539
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,720
Already 3 a.m.

540
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,480
Yes, it is.

541
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,759
Zhenzhu, thanks to you

542
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,720
and your camera.

543
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:08,159
Or it will take forever to
rub these oracle bone inscriptions.

544
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,840
The Institute has transferred

545
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,960
most of the oracle bones.

546
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,280
The rest are all here.

547
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,199
Let's hurry up

548
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,440
and try to finish it overnight.

549
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,480
Okay.

550
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,320
Zhenzhu, you've been a big help.

551
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,920
Go back and take a break.

552
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,880
Without the film,

553
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,159
there's nothing I can do.

554
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,840
I'll go to the office

555
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,159
to see if there is any film.

556
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,119
Okay.

557
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:37,198
Thank you.

558
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,119
See you later.

559
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,559
Uncle Ling, look.

560
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,119
There's another one with Zi.

561
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,559
Zi is the surname of Queen Fu Zi.

562
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,480
That's right.

563
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,559
King Wu Ding must have loved her deeply.

564
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,239
That's why he left her name on so many oracle bones.

565
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,039
Too bad she died too young.

566
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,400
King Wu Ding has reigned for 59 years.

567
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,480
Just imagine how sad he must have been

568
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,199
since she passed away.

569
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,199
Are you grieving for people who lived 3,000 years ago?

570
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,280
Yes. But I also envy them.

571
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,800
The couple dedicated their whole life

572
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,039
to the rejuvenation of the Shang dynasty.

573
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:25,119
What's more, Fu Zi was a general.

574
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,159
True.

575
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,440
After she passed away,

576
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,119
King Wu Ding carried on their cause.

577
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
That was what she wanted, right?

578
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,800
Uncle Ling, do you think the love they had is perfect?

579
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,960
Perfect or not...

580
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,920
I don't know.

581
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,599
After all, that's 3,000 years ago.

582
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,079
But the reign of King Wu Ding

583
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,280
is marked by the worship of deities,

584
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,559
the importance attached to commerce,

585
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,159
and the respect paid to women.

586
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,079
Given the status of women at ancient times,

587
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,639
to have her name inscribed on so many oracle bones

588
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,159
suggests her uniqueness and status.

589
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,639
Mr. Ling!

590
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,480
Mr. Ling, you need to leave right now.

591
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,440
This is a bomb alert.

592
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,760
But I haven't finished my work yet.

593
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,159
Sir, if these bones can survive,

594
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,480
the air force will bring them to Chongqing in a few days.

595
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,119
Please leave now.

596
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,400
Life comes first.

597
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:22,079
Fine, hurry, take them.

598
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,519
Take the most important ones.

599
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
What do you want?

600
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,079
Who are you?

601
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Mr. Ling, nice to meet you.

602
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,239
Transport Brigade of Central Aviation School.

603
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,039
We're here to transfer cultural relics

604
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,239
of the Institute by order.

605
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,159
According to an informant,

606
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,639
you're hiding the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

607
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,199
Law on the Preservation of Antiques
by the Legislature Assembly

608
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,079
stipulates all underground antiques
are owned by the state.

609
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,960
Now, please give it to us.

610
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,639
We'll escort it to Chongqing.

611
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,639
Fuhua University should have it for study.

612
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,079
This has been approved by Academia Sinica.

613
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,840
If you want to take it,

614
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,800
you must have the written approval
from Academia Sinica.

615
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,320
You want a written approval?

616
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,239
Fine, go with me, and I'll show you.

617
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,559
Mr. Ling, please.

618
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,360
That's unnecessary.

619
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,960
You can take the approval

620
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,639
and find me in Hangzhou fair and square.

621
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:30,840
Haitang, let's go.

622
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,599
Stop!

623
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,519
Give it to me.

624
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,440
What are you doing?

625
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,000
Stop!

626
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:34,800
You...

627
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,519
Mr. Ling...

628
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,559
Be gentle.

629
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:58,199
Director, the oracle bone of Wuding is not here.

630
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,199
In 30 minutes, the Japanese army will bomb this place.

631
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,760
I don't have time for your tricks.

632
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,079
Give it to me,

633
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,239
or take me to it.

634
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,480
There's no third choice.

635
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,639
Where is it?

636
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,440
By resorting to violence,

637
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,280
it's impossible to get the oracle bone
inscriptions of Wuding from me.

638
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,119
My patience is running out.

639
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,239
I'll count to three.

640
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,119
Think hard.

641
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,159
Where is it?

642
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,199
Take me to it.

643

645
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,039
Wait.

646
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,920
The death of Professor Jin Zhilie...

647
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,719
Do you have something to do with it?

648
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,039
What?

649
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,320
Master Fayan once said,

650
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,239
it's better to leave sentences unfinished.

651
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:52,480
Mr. Ling, I don't know about Professor Jin,

652
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:53,639
or how he died.

653
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,559
Since we're already in this place,

654
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,880
how about I shoot this dear student of yours?

655
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,480
Maybe that will jog your memory.

656
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,119
- Who is it?
- Show yourself.

658
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:18,880
It's me.

659

You scared me.

660
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,519
Let's put on a show.

661

- Who is it?
- Show yourself.

Zhang Qi, are you a ghost?

Should you interfere with our official duty,

even if you have a powerful dad,

672

I'll make you pay.

673

I'll count to three.

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,119
Shoot me.

680
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,039
I knew you're bluffing.

681
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,519
There's no agent at all.

682
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:32,000
Zhang Qi, this girl in front of me

683
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,239
is your fiancee, right?

684
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,920
Wanna bet?

685
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,159
Let's see if you're faster,

686
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,440
or me,

687
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,840
and agent 031.

688
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:13,900
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

689
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:21,800
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

690
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:29,250
♫ Shed tears to our sweet love ♫

691

♫ The date of return is yet to come ♫

692
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,900
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

693
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,730
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

694
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:52,730
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

695
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:59,980
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

696
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:07,780
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

697
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,930
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

698
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:25,630
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫

699
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,880
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

700
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,400
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

701
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:55,700
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

702
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:02,730
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

703
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:10,550
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

704
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:16,900
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫
