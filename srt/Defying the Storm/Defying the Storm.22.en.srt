[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,060
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,560
I remember that Aunt Meng said she had asked someone

4
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
to tell you fortune, didn't she?

5
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,230
It's said that there will be

6
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,000
a begonia flower on the body of your future husband.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,760
Do you remember?

8
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,950
Is there any begonia flowers on Zhang Qi?

9
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,400
Yes!

10
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,430
When I first met him,

11
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,430
I saw a begonia flower under his ear.

12
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,790
When I got closer, I found it was a birthmark.

13
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,640
Isn't that what people called

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,920
marriage coming by destiny?

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,120
I also remember

16
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,480
the first time I met with Poshan

17
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,590
was in a bookstore in Hangzhou.

18
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,840
I'm telling you,

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,870
I didn't even plan on buying books.

20
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,960
But when I passed that store,

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,360
I suddenly wanted to go inside.

22
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,630
To my surprise,

23
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,000
Poshan and I chose the same book.

24
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,310
What surprised me even more was that

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,710
you rented our house later.

26
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,840
Isn't it just fated?

27
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,470
Who's fated to be with me?

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,560
Don't mention Nianqiao.

29
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,430
Choose another one.

30
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,280
But who's fated to be with Nianqiao?

31
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,080
Cheers.

32
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,120
Father, don't drink too much.

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,750
I'm fine.

34
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,960
Poshan.

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,710
After you get married, you should be nice to your wife.

36
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,710
She's chosen you over her parents.

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,190
From now on, you'll be her everything.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,190
Be nice to her.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
If you treat her badly,

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
I'll never agree to that.

41
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,800
What I regret most in my life is

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,240
leaving your mother behind in Hailun City.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,560
I failed to take care of her.

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,680
Dad,

45
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,240
do you know

46
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,560
how mom used to repeat from sunrise to sunset,

47
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,630
saying "he'll be back today"?

48
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,470
She's been saying that all her life,

49
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,150
waiting for you to come home.

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Can you tell me why you did that?

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,150
She's been dead.

52
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,630
Just forget it.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,870
But we can't pretend it never happened.

54
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,030
If you don't talk about it anymore,

55
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,310
it's gonna stay between us for the rest of our lives.

56
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,920
You abandoned my mother and me

57
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,950
for more than a decade.

58
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,310
I used to wonder

59
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,310
if I was your real son.

60
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,120
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,600
You're definitely my real son.

62
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,800
You...

63
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,190
Do you remember a swing

64
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,390
you used to play on when you were a kid?

65
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,160
Yes.

66
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,720
Mom made it.

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,920
It's me who made it.

68
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,390
I made it myself when I came back to Hailun

69
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,160
to see you two when you were three years old.

70
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,600
You were too young to remember it.

71
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,510
OK.

72
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
You made the swing.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,310
But the person who pushed me on the swing

74
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,830
was always mom.

75
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,600
I wished you could go home
and do the same thing at least once.

76
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,800
But it never happened.

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,800
At least I don't remember.

78
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,390
Yes.

79
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,600
You're right.

80
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,190
When I was a kid,

81
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,070
I was often bullied by the older kids
in the neighborhood.

82
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,070
At that time

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,120
I always wished you was there with me.

84
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,830
I was sure you'd protect me.

85
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,630
I gradually got over it
and was completely disappointed.

86
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,950
Do you know why I joined the army?

87
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,510
I failed to protect them.

88
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,600
I couldn't save my mom, grandma and grandpa

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,430
from the Japanese.

90
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,120
Then I have to

91
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,920
protect other people's mothers and grandparents.

92
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,160
I want to save everyone as long as I can,

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,310
even at the cost of myself.

94
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,950
Father, father.

95
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,560
OK.

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,240
Take a break.

97
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,270
I don't want to talk about it.

98
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,240
Remember.

99
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,560
It's not that I don't like your mother.

100
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,750
OK?

101
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,160
Poshan,

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,390
now,

103
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,310
don't put father on the spot.

104
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,270
It's hard for him, too.

105
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,600
Tomorrow is the big day for you.

106
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,390
Let the past be forgotten.

107
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm sure father will have a talk with you one day.

108
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,950
Take it.

109
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,160
I bought it for your mother when I was abroad

110
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,870
but never got a chance to give it to her.

111
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,480
Now I give it to your wife.

112
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,270
As a wedding gift from your father.

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,920
The pigeon...

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,430
knows the way home.

115
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,800
By the way,

116
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,720
you used to call Mr. Zeng Mu "Uncle Zeng",

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,070
now you call him Master Zeng.

118
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,270
Have you ever thought that one day in the future...

119
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,240
if you really marry Nianqiao,

120
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,510
you have to call Mr. Zeng "father"?

121
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,240
Yes!

122
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,390
Nianqiao is the adopted son of Master Zeng.

123
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,950
Nianqiao once annoyed Master Zeng,

124
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,190
then Master said "I'll disown you".

125
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,270
His bark is worse than his bite.

126
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,310
When I was a kid, I always watched him

127
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,070
carry Nianqiao around on his shoulders.

128
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,800
Besides,

129
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,830
he's been raising Nianqiao longer than Poshan.

130
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,390
It's kind of interesting to think you're gonna

131
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,000
call Uncle Zeng "father".

132
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,870
"Always respect your teacher as you do your father."

133
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,950
"Master" and "father" mean the same thing.

134
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,240
Oh, come on!

135
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,190
For better or worse,

136
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,240
the past is the past.

137
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,040
Now.

138
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,920
We're a family of four now.

139
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,560
Yes.

140
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,870
One day Poshan will have a baby,

141
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,120
and you'll get a wife.

142
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,600
Well, then we'll be one big family.

143
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,870
Yes.

144
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,160
Even Scholar Meng is no match for me.

145
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,160
Yes, he is.

146
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,120
Oh, dear!

147
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,790
Oh, my!

148
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,120
I got a name for your kid.

149
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,390
Jintian.

150
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,150
Jintian?

151
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,670
Yes, it means beautiful and bright sky.

152
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,440
Jintian!

153
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,390
Whether the baby will be a boy or a girl.

154
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,550
There are clouds in the bright and beautiful sky,
just like your kid will have the same virtue as jade.

155
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,750
Jintian is a great name.

156
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,080
I chose this name because I hope that your kid

157
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,790
will not only be fed and clothed,

158
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,120
but also learn knowledge, be educated
and be promising in the future.

159
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,320
Yes.

160
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,150
Jintian!

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,790
Aunt Meng,

162
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,750
you're still awake.

163
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,870
Is your dad drunk?

164
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,320
A little too much.

165
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,720
But father could hold it.

166
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,750
He'll be up tomorrow morning.

167
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
Have you arranged for the vehicle

168
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,390
to pick up Yuanyin tomorrow?

169
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,790
Yes, sure.

170
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,600
But...

171
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,910
the bride's home and the groom's home

172
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,240
are both in the Barn Compound.

173
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,720
How will you pick her up?

174
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,600
Tomorrow, all the people of our Squadron will come.

175
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,670
We'll set up a cycling team

176
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,320
and pick up Yuanyin here.

177
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,600
Then we'll pedal to Fuhua University.

178
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,960
After all,

179
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,870
Poshan was a student of Fuhua University.

180
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,000
After that tour,

181
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,870
we'll pick up everyone here

182
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,080
to the wedding feast in Yulong Hill.

183
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,390
The vehicle to Yulong Hill is also arranged?

184
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,510
The captain said he'd do it.

185
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,720
OK, that's good.

186
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,600
Mom said

187
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,480
that Yuanyin need to get up early tomorrow.

188
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,840
Then,

189
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,550
she'll come and do your makeup.

190
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,910
My mom can do your hair for the wedding!

191
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,550
What are you going to do?

192
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,960
You can't see the bride the night before the wedding.

193
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,390
I have something for Yuanyin.

194
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,720
You should follow the wedding rule.

195
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,440
I can give it to her for you.

196
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,670
OK.

197
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,030
I won't see her tonight.

198
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I'll go back.

199
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,840
Nianqiao, wait for a second.

200
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,600
You!

201
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,790
Yuanyin,

202
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,080
it's Poshan.

203
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,360
Poshan?

204
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,630
Poshan,

205
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,550
you'll see the bride tomorrow.

206
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,440
I'll turn my back, and I won't see her.

207
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,840
Yuanyin,

208
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,630
open the window.

209
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,870
I got something for you.

210
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,030
OK.

211
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,200
Here.

212
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,200
I got it.

213
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,910
Open it.

214
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,870
What's that?

215
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,390
It's a ring made of colored glaze.

216
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,200
There is a pigeon on it.

217
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,600
My dad asked me to give it to you.

218
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,270
It's from my mom and he.

219
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,320
Pigeons know how to find their way.

220
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,600
No matter how far it flies, it'll find its way home.

221
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,270
I grew up with an incomplete family.

222
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,870
But from now on you are my family.

223
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,080
I swear to you that I will come back to you

224
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,440
no matter how high or how far I fly.

225
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,870
Poshan, I know.

226
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,910
Well, Yuanyin,

227
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,720
have you tried on the cheongsam?

228
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,670
How's it fitting?

229
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,550
I tried it on and it fits perfectly.

230
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,910
Great.

231
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,790
Can you wear the button on your chest forever?

232
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,750
OK.

233
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,440
For my whole life.

234
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,120
OK.

235
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,000
Then I'll go back.

236
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,240
See you tomorrow.

237
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,080
He's gone.

238
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,480
He's so far away. You can't see him.

239
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,670
Yuanyin,

240
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,480
I envy you so much.

241
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,600
Poshan, Nianqiao, and Qi.

242
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,600
They are the men who fly in the sky.

243
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,720
We are the women who look up to the sky.

244
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,030
This.

245
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,510
One on each side.

246
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,550
Here.

247
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,320
Try this.

248
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,030
This one is beautiful.

249
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,510
Try this, and take a look.

250
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,270
Nice?

251
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,510
Knock with your hand!

252
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,390
Meng Wuran!

253
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,390
Meng Wuran.

254
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,510
How do I look?

255
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,840
The coat fits OK.

256
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,240
But the small pair of shoes,

257
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,630
you can keep them for yourself.

258
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,720
I wear the shoes my son gave me.

259
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,120
Thank you!

260
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,000
Mr. Zeng.

261
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,720
We've been waiting for you to put on your new clothes.

262
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's take a picture together.

263
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,320
Great.

264
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,840
That's a good idea.

265
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,480
Where?

266
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,440
Here!

267
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,150
Come on!

268
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,120
The camera is ready?

269
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,270
Dairong did it.

270
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,550
OK, come here.

271
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,120
Come on.

272
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
Come here, are you ready?

273
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,480
Ready?

274
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes.

275
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:53,960
Did you bring it?

276
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,720
Yes, here.

277
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,000
Where do I put this?

278
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,840
Put it there and bring it to the table later.

279
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,480
OK.

280
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,510
Mom, Aunt, Donglai!

281
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,510
There you are!

282
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,000
Take a sit!

283
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,790
Where is Haitang?

284
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,390
She's upstairs.

285
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,200
There you are!

286
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,870
Why are you looking at me like that?

287
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,440
You look beautiful.

288
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,550
I promise you that when Poshan's wedding is over,

289
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,200
I'll give you a bigger wedding.

290
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,960
Really?

291
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,480
I heard what you said when we parted at Jianqiao.

292
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,480
At that time, I was afraid that I couldn't come back
and you would be sad,

293
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,510
so I didn't respond to you.

294
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,070
Now I can't fly a plane anymore.

295
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,790
But I can always be with you.

296
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,510
That's not bad.

297
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,960
You don't mind, do you?

298
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,440
Of course not.

299
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,440
Well...

300
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,550
Will you still marry me?

301
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,400
I do.

302
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,510
By the way,

303
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,110
I saw this in your room when we were in Peiping.

304
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,510
I made one for you.

305
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,680
You made it?

306
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,720
The record of a meteor shower
on oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding?

307
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,200
Yes.

308
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
All stars moved westward.

309
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,070
It's nice.

310
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,030
Mr. Zeng.

311
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,440
Uncle Zeng.

312
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,480
Mr. Zeng.

313
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,790
There you are!

314
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,720
Congratulations!

315
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,510
Thank you!

316
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,110
First, on behalf of myself,

317
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,830
congratulations to Poshan
for marrying such a wonderful wife.

318
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,030
Second, on behalf of my father,

319
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,110
I bring a gift for them.

320
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,640
Bring it in!

321
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,550
Come in, please!

322
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,880
What are these?

323
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,920
So much!

324
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,750
Oh, that's very kind of you.

325
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,310
Take it easy.

326
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,880
That's from Supervisor Bai.

327
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,510
It's too generous.

328
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,350
You guys can go home.

329
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,440
Yes.

330
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,400
- Thanks.
- Not over yet.

331
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,110
Wait a second.

332
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,830
Stop playing chess.

333
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,400
Playing chess.

334
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,400
That's OK.

335
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,270
Take a seat!

336
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,480
Come here. Get some tea.

337
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,510
OK, that's great.

338
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,790
Get some tea.

339
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,440
Great.

340
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,160
Thank you, aunt.

341
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,640
Here.

342
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,400
Where is Bing Bing?

343
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,790
Why don't I see Bing Bing?

344
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,070
I need to talk to him.

345
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,400
Bing Bing, Bing Bing.

346
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,160
You look for him every time you come here.

347
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
People who don't know will think he's your boyfriend.

348
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,070
Are you jealous?

349
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,510
Why would I be jealous?

350
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,590
I mean,

351
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,960
you can talk about it later.

352
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,030
Here.

353
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,110
Haichen.

354
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
My brother-in-law is with my sister.

355
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,830
I see we'll be having...

356
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,750
I see we'll be having our next wedding soon.

357
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,640
Hong'en,

358
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,400
when are you and Miss Bai going to get married?

359
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,440
You should hurry up.

360
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,830
Three happy events come at the same time!

361
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,400
Well...

362
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,310
As soon as Zhenzhu nods,

363
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,270
I'll go to ask her dad to approve my marriage with her.

364
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Miss Bai.

365
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,070
Where is Yuanyin?

366
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,440
I'm going to see the bride.

367
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,720
You guys talk.

368
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,550
Yuanyin!

369
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,440
She's so shy!

370
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,240
She's shy.

371
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
That's how she is.

372
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,350
Let me take a look.

373
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,790
So wonderful.

374
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Let me see.

375
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Great.

376
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,480
Oh!

377
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,920
Yuanyin,

378
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,750
today is your big day.

379
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,640
That's my most favorite sea pearl.

380
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,270
It's for you.

381
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,480
Sea pearl?

382
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,400
It's black!

383
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,920
Yes.

384
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,480
Black sea pearls are rare.

385
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,510
Rare things are for nice people.

386
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,310
Thank you.

387
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,350
You're all here.

388
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,160
Today I'm part of the bride's family.

389
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,880
The three of us walked here.

390
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,240
We're already lifelong friends.

391
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,720
Great!

392
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,440
You, block the door later.

393
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,720
They'll arrive at 8:00.

394
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,350
OK.

395
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,000
Haitang, Qianying, Miss Bai,

396
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,640
you're today's "door-gods".

397
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,880
When they knock on the door later,

398
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,830
don't rush to open the door,

399
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,590
ask for red envelopes first.

400
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,000
There is 9.99 yuan in each red envelope.

401
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,750
Three red envelopes in three times, not one less.

402
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,160
Don't open the door till you get all envelopes,
or it'll be bad luck.

403
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,070
OK.

404
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,550
You're not getting any better at chess.

405
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,590
I...

406
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,960
So I'm telling you...

407
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,000
What's the rush?

408
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,400
They're here!

409
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,160
I'll go check it out.

410
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,030
I'll close the door.

411
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,720
Come on, close the door.

412
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,550
Hurry up, come here.

413
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,640
Dad.

414
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,590
There you are!

415
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,510
Got the red envelopes ready?

416
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,880
Don't worry.

417
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,160
They're here.

418
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,240
Go inside!

419
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,030
Knock a few more times
to show your sincerity.

420
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,680
OK.

421
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,310
Let's go.

422
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,070
Bro, let's go.

423
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,310
We're here, bride!

424
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,550
Here we come.

425
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,400
Here!

426
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,960
Kid,

427
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,880
do you like kites?

428
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,790
Yes!

429
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,550
It's a gift for you.

430
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,310
See, what a big and beautiful kite!

431
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,510
I'll let you play with it.

432
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,200
OK.

433
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,830
Can you fly it?

434
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,400
Yes.

435
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,680
Go ahead.

436
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,480
I got a kite!

437
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,550
We have to prepare other signals, just in case.

438
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,790
Yuanyin,

439
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,480
I'm here for you, open the door.

440
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,480
Open the door!

441
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,110
Open it!

442
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,830
Open the door!

443
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,480
No! The red envelopes!

444
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,640
Red envelope!

445
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,350
Captain.

446
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,510
Just open the door a crack.

447
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,640
Then I'll give it to you!

448
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm blocking the door.

449
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,030
Donglai, hang in there.

450
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,240
Got it!

451
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,400
Close the door.

452
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,270
Open it.

453
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,030
The second one!

454
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,000
Another one!

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,350
The bride has to be invited three times.

456
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,070
Hurry up, Captain.

457
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,960
Hurry up, Captain. Next one.

458
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,680
Yes.

459
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,110
OK.

460
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,000
Hurry up, Captain. Next one.

461
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,720
Next one.

462
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,160
Here.

463
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Open it. The second one.

464
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,510
Here.

465
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,400
Here you are.

466
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,480
Here.

467
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,400
Open the door.

468
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:41,830
Donglai.

469
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,030
Donglai, you traitor!

470
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,000
Open the door.

471
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,720
The third one.

472
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,830
Again?

473
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,480
Just two!

474
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,640
Don't be a traitor, Li Donglai.

475
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,510
The third one!

476
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,160
Preventive alarm. Preventive alarm.

477
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,510
Enemy planes are coming.

478
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,640
Everybody hide!

479
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,640
Enemy planes are coming!

480
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,750
Take cover!

481
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,110
They're coming!

482
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,790
Run and hide.

483
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,030
Take cover!

484
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,030
Go! Hurry up!

485
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,880
Be quick!

486
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,680
Oh, no. Air-defense warning.

487
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,240
Enemy planes will enter Yunnan in an hour.

488
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,960
Come with me to Wujiaba Airport.

489
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,000
Yes.

490
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,240
Poshan, I gave you permission to stay

491
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,270
and lead the evacuation.

492
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:33,960
Captain,

493
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,920
I fly the leader.

494
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,070
I'm the only one who can fly Xishan.

495
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,440
Poshan.

496
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,070
Yuanyin.

497
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,310
Find a place to hide.

498
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,030
I'll be back soon.

499
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,830
Wait for me.

500
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:03,960
Captain.

501
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,400
Haitang, take everyone to Yuantong Mountain
for evacuation.

502
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,400
Hanguang Squadron, let's go.

503
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,720
Zhang Qi.

504
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,960
Poshan.

505
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,830
Brother!

506
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
Where are you going?

507
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,550
Poshan, where are you going?

508
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,880

Mom.

543

Do you want to die?

561
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,310
This is the British Embassy's supply truck!

562
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,350
The car is requisitioned
by Hanguang Squadron during the war.

563
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,240
Take me to Wujiaba.

I don't see that.

580
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,400
Where did you leave it?

581
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,550
On the ground.

582
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,920
Uncle Ling, I don't see anything.

583
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,000
Hong'en!

Where's the briefcase?

588
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,350
I can't find it.

589
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,480
Be quick.

590
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
Excuse me, please.

591
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,680

Zhenzhu.

594
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,350
Zhenzhu, where are you going?

595
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,680
I have to get back to Fuhua.

596
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,790
It's too dangerous now.

597
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,200
You can go after the air raid.

598
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:51,920
No.

599
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,400
Zhang Qi has my stuff.

600
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,200
We'll be in trouble if it get blown up.

Excuse me.

602

Wait, Zhenzhu.

603
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,590

Excuse me, please.

605
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,680
Zhenzhu!

606
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,680
Captain.

607
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,110
Come with me to the control tower.

608

099, 095.

610
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,680
Each of you, take a plane and
interfere with the Mitsubishi G3M.

611
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,440
Fly around the airport. Keep them out of the city.

612
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,400
095 copy.

095 copy.

614
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,920
730, come with me to attract the left planes.

615
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,240
765, 099, attract the right ones.

616
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,920
Move out.

617
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,270
Xishan, you hide in the clouds.

618
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,440
Don't let the enemy notice you.

619
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,030
Wait for an opportunity to pounce.

620
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,680
Xishan copy.

621
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,720
Flying around the airport?

622
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,750
Right in the range of our antiaircraft guns.

623
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,750
I know you put two anti-aircraft guns there
two days ago.

624
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,480
Minister.

625
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,200
Please punish me for my recklessness.

626
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,880
It's an emergency. Just sit here.

627
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,070
We shot down one.

628
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,400
Great!

629
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,790
Lead your team.

630
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,960
Xishan, report your location.

631
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,750
Xishan, report your location.

632
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,440
Xishan is flying over the clouds.

633
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,480
Xishan is 9000 feet.

634
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,590
Xishan, nose down and launch a raid.

635
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,200
Target the left wing. Aim their tanks.

636
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,000
Hit and run.

637
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,070
Outflank the enemy on the right.

638
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,960
Air ranger. Outflank.

639

00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,070
Nice, great!

642
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,030
Zhang Qi.

643
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,400
Zeng Poshan did a nice job.

644
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,830
Sir.

645
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,160
Another fleet enters Yunnan.

646
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,110
Six Mitsubishi G3Ms.

647
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,510
Another fleet. Six planes.

648
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,440
Left rear.

649
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,720
I can't hear them.

650
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,070
Zeng Nianqiao,

651
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,630
take full control of the air.

652

095 copy.

653
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,630
Minister,

654
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,000
they can't hold the second fleet.

655
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,190
They need aerial support.

656
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,150
The others have gone to help Wuhan.

657
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,320
Hanguang Squadron

658
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,840
must protect the skies over Kunming.

659
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,150
The second fleet is heading downtown.

660
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,920
Divide into two groups of three and two.

661
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,070
Go after the second fleet.

662
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,510
993, 099, 765,

663
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,150
peel off, peel off.

664
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,110
Sir.

665
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,190
The Dewoitine D.520s on the ground were blown up.

666
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,150
How many?

667
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,070
Sir, four.

668
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,930
What's wrong with Zeng Nianqiao?

669
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,150
With five against seven, we could secure the airport.

670
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,920
But now, two groups?

671
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,710
Three against six, two against seven?

672
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,590
What should we do?

673
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,480
He's right.

674
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,840
These six Mitsubishi G3Ms are heading downtown.

675
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,400
Based on their flight path,

676
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,440
their real target is downtown.

677
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,230
Enemy planes! Take cover!

678
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:53,840
Go!

679
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,760
This way!

680
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,110
Go!

681
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Go to the abri!

682
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,670
Hurry up!

683
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,110
What am I gonna do?

684
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,550
What should I take?

685
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,230
The second fleet of Japan moved to the city in spiral.

686
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,760
It seems they haven't found the target yet.

687
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,360
Was their target Fuhua University?

688
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,400
We need to intercept them now.

689
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,800
993, organize a fleet.

690
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,030
Intercept the enemy heading down the city.

691
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,590
Xishan copy.

692
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,400
099, 765.

693
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,880
Cover the flank.

694
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,510
765 copy.

695
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,630
Xishan.

696
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,400
I'm responsible for hovering
and luring enemy to be close.

697
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,840
When he's in your shooting area, roll and fire.

698
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,880
Xishan cooperated with 099

699
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,880
and shot down an plane again.

700
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,230
Great!

701
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,710
Xishan.

702
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,710
Say remaining fuel.

703
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,030
Xishan.

704
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,320
We have 20 minutes of fuel remaining.

705
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,230
Xishan, be back in ten minutes.

706
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,360
Repeat.

707
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,480
Be back in ten minutes.

708
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,800
Concentrate forces against 993.

709
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,920
Xishan, Xishan.

710
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,070
Four planes are following you.

711
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,150
Get rid of them quickly.

712
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,670
Xishan has been shot.

713
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,440
The fuel line of engine ruptured.

714
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,550
It affects my sight.

715
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,760
Xishan is out of fuel.

716
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,480
Xishan.

717
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,150
Parachute and abandon the aircraft, now!

718
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,150
Xishan,

719
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,510
parachute!

720
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,880
There are lots of houses and people.

721
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,230
Parachute and abandon the aircraft, now!

722
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,400
Campus!

723
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,230
Xishan is maintaining the height.

724
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,670
Xishan'll fly out of the city.

725
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,800
Xishan, this is an order.

726
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,670
Parachute now!

727
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,550
Zeng Poshan.

728
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,550
Jianqiao Central Aviation School.

729
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,840
You're a pilot?

730
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,880
I'm just a student.

731
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,800
My name is Xu Yuanyin.

732
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,190
"Yuan" means beauty,

733
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,630
while "yin" means green grass.

734
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,320
Yuanyin.

735
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,710
Yuanyin.

736
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,510
Sorry.

737
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,630
Poshan.

738
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,070
Xishan!

739
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,550
Xishan!

740
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,760
Xishan!

741
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,510
Xishan crashed.

742
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,760
Repeat, Xishan crashed.

743
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,070
Minister.

744
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,320
Please search for the crash site
of Xishan immediately.

745
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,360
Poshan may get a chance to parachute.

746
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,360
Search for Xishan right now.

747
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,070
Yes.

748
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,800
095 is stuck by five escort fighters.

749
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,510
095, you're in danger.

750
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,710
Pull up and get rid of tails.

751
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,320
Without an oxygen mask, you'll be in danger.

752
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,670
They also don't have oxygen masks.

753
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,480
Chase me if they dare.

754
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:54,780
