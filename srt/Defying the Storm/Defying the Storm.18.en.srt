[Episode 18]

4
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,200
Don't rush, take your time.

5
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,510
Slow down, don't speed up.

6
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,590
Captain, come on, take a break, come on.

7
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,120
You've been injured for three months,

8
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,200
and you're not recovered.

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,040
Don't be in a hurry.

10
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,150
If I don't practice, I'm afraid my legs will atrophy.

11
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,679
I can't even board the plane.

12
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,759
Have you read the newspaper?

13
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,719
The day before yesterday, the Fourth Brigade,

14
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,800
nineteen I-15 Fighters,

15
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,199
sixteen I-16 Fighters,

16
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,520
had a battle with the Japanese Naval Air Wing.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,560
We shot down twelve of their planes.

18
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,080
Yes, we punched the Japanese in the face.

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,280
But, we lost Captain Li and five pilots.

20
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,190
Our military equipment strength is too weak.

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,800
However, we let them know with our lives that

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,910
the Chinese won't give up any inch of our territory.

23
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
I need to catch up on my practice and get recovered.

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,439
I need to fight with the enemies.

25
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,400
Poshan and others are waiting for me to take the flight.

26
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,639
The most honorable, is the sun.

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,319
The planet Earth orbits around it.

28
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,919
The earth is round and with temperature zones.

29
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,159
People from all countries live on the earth.

30
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,159
The tropics are hot, the frigid zone is cold.

31
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,800
Hello.

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,960
We fled from Zhejiang all the way to here.

33
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,910
They are my students and we are going to Kunming.

34
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,400
Is there anything to eat?

35
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,430
We don't have any food at home either. Go away.

36
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,319
Don't waste the good time.

37
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,840
Look, can you give us some rice?

38
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm really sorry.

39
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,470
We don't have any extra rice.

40
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,520
Why don't you go elsewhere?

41
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,960
Thank you.

42
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Wujiaba is not comparable to Jianqiao.

43
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,680
It can't be like it used to be.

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,280
Four people lived in a building.

45
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,519
However, I asked for a single room for you.

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,750
Chen Ran and I packed it all out for you.

47
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,120
I forgot to pick up the medication.

48
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,519
Stay here for a while.

49
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,800
Then I'll go to the gate and wait for you there.

50
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,630
I don't want to stay for a moment.

51
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,600
Zhang Qi seems to have recovered quite well
in the past few months.

52
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,950
If he doesn't want to be hospitalized,

53
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,240
he can be discharged temporarily.

54
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,319
For the moment,

55
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,070
he survived, but the future is not easy to say.

56
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,879
The bullet in his chest

57
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,800
could cause cavity pressure damage

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,199
to his heart and lung tissues at any time.

59
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,750
It may also cause traumatic pleurisy.

60
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,199
The risk to life remains.

61
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,160
So make sure he doesn't do any strenuous exercise

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,519
after he is discharged from the hospital.

63
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,270
Symptoms such as fatigue, low fever,

64
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,639
and respiratory pain may also be present.

65
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,680
Anyway, try to rest in bed.

66
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,120
The most important thing is to put him in a good mood

67
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,319
and not to get him emotional.

68
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,120
Doctor,

69
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,040
can't he fly an airplane?

70
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,079
He's recovering quite well.

71
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,079
Any strenuous exercise

72
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,040
could be life-threatening for him.

73
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,120
It was hard to save his life.

74
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,040
Take good care of him,

75
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,800
and tell him to take care of himself.

76
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,519
Thank you.

77

[Kunming Hospital]

78
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,920
Are you blind? Don't you see me?

79
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,199
I just came down from the front line,

80
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,360
with broken arms and legs.

81
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,560
If you hit me, I will kill you!

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,759
I fought for you guys.

83
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,560
Shouldn't you apologize for hitting me?

84
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't you have any money on you?

85
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,079
Take it out as an apology!

86
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,439
Don't you know the rules?

87
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,160
Look at him.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,040
This bastard!

89
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,079
Sir.

90
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,240
That was a misunderstanding.

91
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,600
He is from the air force, and he is an officer too.

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,360
Just go.

93
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,120
I got myself a hero with this leg.

94
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,600
What about you?

95
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,510
I just can't stand the bastards of air force.

96
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,210
If it weren't because that they were all deserters,

97
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,759
I won't be injured!

98
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,830
When the Japanese planes were over our heads,

99
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,240
do you know how bad it could be?

100
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,279
You don't know.

101
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,720
Because you ran away before you got hit!

102
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,240
You hit the mountain when you were running away?

103
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,830
The navy were wiped out in the battle of Jiangyin.

104
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,319
Our land forces fought hard for three months

105
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
and more than 200,000 died!

106
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,360
All you airmen know is to drop bombs!

107
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,310
Bombing over the ships of friendly troops and our own.

108
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,870
Not a single corner of the Japanese ship was off.

109
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,319
My leg was broken

110
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,800
because you dropped a bomb in Jiangyin!

111
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,600
Why don't you say anything?

112
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,519
Are you mute?

113
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,560
Stop!

114
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,439
Mind your words!

115
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,000
This is the captain of the Central Aviation School,

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,480
Hanguang Squadron,

117
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,519
Major Zhang Qi!

118
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,519
He was the only pilot in the combat formation of

119
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,959
Hanguang Squadron who survived!

120
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,319
In the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of Nanjing,

121
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,199
our troops suffered heavy casualties.

122
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,480
We will take our revenge on the enemy!

123
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,240
However,

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
all strategic deployments of the air force

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,519
were ordered by the General Headquarters!

126
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,759
Sir,

127
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,360
if you think the Generalissimo's decision is wrong,

128
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,879
go to the Military Academy.

129
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,720
Yes!

130
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,279
The reputation of our army is important!

131
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,160
The reputation of the air force is important!

132
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,750
And so is the reputation of the Generalissimo!

133
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,759
Great hero!

134
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,759
Your whole squadron was gone.

135
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,559
How did you get back alive?

136
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,679
You are a hero

137
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,600
for stepping on the bones of your fellows!

138
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,559
Are you okay?

139
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,600
One more.

140
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,360
Dude,

141
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,679
what happened to the captain?

142
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,120
Is he in a bad mood?

143
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,440
Let's go and check it out.

144
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
Captain, take a break.

145
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,080
Is everything okay, captain?

146
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,919
I'll check the targets.

147
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,639
Go check it out.

148
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,440
Nineteen, twenty, twenty, nineteen, twenty.

149
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,080
Captain,

150
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,639
you hit ninety-eight rings!

151
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,120
That's awesome!

152
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,720
Yes, it's great.

153
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,480
- Captain!
- Captain!

154
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,399
Nurse.

155
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,200
I'd like to know more about my condition.

156
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,910
Ask Dr. Chen, he's in that office.

157
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,720
Thank you.

158
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,399
You're welcome.

159
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,480
Zeng Nianqiao!

160
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,360
What the hell is wrong with you?

161
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,120
I just left, how come something happened?

162
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,799
I asked you to take care of Zhang Qi,

163
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,679
but see what you've done.

164
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,240
If he dies in front of you, how will you explain?

165
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,799
Doctor,

166
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
he is recovering quite well.

167
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,790
How come the heart rhythm is abnormal after shooting?

168
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,240
As long as that bullet is still in his body,

169
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,600
he should never fly again.

170
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,150
The doctor from the aviation commission
said the same thing.

171
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
But technology has advanced.

172
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,750
Doctor, can you do an operation to remove the bullet?

173
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,639
I took another X-ray of him.

174
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,360
That bullet has been displaced.

175
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,240
Now in this situation, I need to give you a warning.

176
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,550
He can't even do jogging or playing basketball,

177
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,840
not to mention flying.

178
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,200
But there are similar cases before.

179
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,910
The patient had a bullet in the chest
that can't be removed.

180
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,790
But he still lived for more than twenty years.

181
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,919
Anyway, take good care of him.

182
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,720
There is still great hope for him to live normally.

183
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,600
Just no more flying.

184
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,200
Zhang Qi?

185
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,000
The man I used to know

186
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,870
has never been a self-pitying person.

187
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,320
When we got you back from the Battle of Jiangyin,

188
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,440
you were clutching this coin in your hand.

189
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,799
It turned out that every time Ding won...

190
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,840
was because of this commemorative coin.

191
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,800
[Aviation saves the nation]

192
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,799
Who wins,

193
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,679
who gets this bullet.

194
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,559
It's the side of "Aviation saves the nation" every time.

195
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,919
You win every time.

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,630
I don't believe you can beat me this time!

197
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,879
I want you to tell my family that I am safe.

198
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,790
There will be new comrades from the organization,

199
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,240
who will contact you, test you until you are accepted.

200
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,360
Here is the cipher.

201
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,840
I want you to tell my family that I am safe.

202
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,360
The next one is

203
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,759
I want to join the battle to fight for glory.

204
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,879
I want you to tell my family that I am safe.

205
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,080
I want to join the battle to fight for glory.

206
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,039
Comrade Zhang Qi.

207
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,440
What did you call me?

208
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:00,960
Comrade Zhang Qi.

209
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,600
Comrade Ding Huansheng,

210
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,000
on 4th November, 1937,

211
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,120
reported your application for membership
to the organization.

212
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,759
The organization accepted your application.

213
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
You are approved to join the Communist Party of China.

214
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,639
I hope that

215
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,080
as a member of the CPC,

216
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,799
you are determined to resist the war to the end.

217
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,390
You are determined to fight to the end for communism.

218
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,200
Implement the Party's resolutions.

219
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,639
Strictly abide by the Party's discipline.

220
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,279
Never bow down in the face of difficulties.

221
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,120
Fight bravely on the battlefield.

222
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,519
With lifelong commitment to the Party's cause.

223
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,680
To resist the war to the end.

224
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
To fight to the end for communism.

225
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,599
Implement the Party's resolutions.

226
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,839
Strictly abide by the Party's discipline.

227
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,640
Never bow down in the face of difficulties.

228
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,160
Fight bravely on the battlefield.

229
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
With lifelong commitment to the Party's cause.

230
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,000
Captain.

231
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,359
For the sake of communist ideals,

232
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,039
from now on, we shall live and die together!

233
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,519
Supervisor Bai, you have a happy family.

234
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,559
I envy you.

235
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
This is your daughter, right?

236
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
She is so young.

237
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,799
You didn't have your daughter at an early age, right? 

238
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,480
These are all old photos.

239
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,480
My wife passed away many years ago.

240
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,759
I have her in my middle age.

241
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,799
Let's not talk about her.

242
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,119
What are these handcuffs?

243
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,070
I have thirty-one pairs of these handcuffs.

244
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,640
There are thirty counties
along the Yunnan-Burma Highway.

245
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,240
I hung a pair in each prefect's office.

246
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,599
I also have a pair hanging here.

247
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,440
I'm reminding them of the importance of the highway.

248
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,359
It can't be overstated.

249
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,680
If it can't be finished in one year,

250
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,640
they will come to Kunming in handcuffs
[Bai Fei, Supervisor of the Yunnan Provincial Regiment

251
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
and get imprisoned.
[Director of the Yunnan-Guizhou Pacification Office]

252
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm the same.

253
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,480
I'll accompany them to jail.

254
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,920
Supervisor Bai, I heard that you are vigorous in work.

255
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,350
It is really admirable.

256
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,519
Well.

257
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,480
Thank you.

258
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,119
Have some tea.

259
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:18,799
Great tea!

260
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,279
Authentic Shunning Taiping tea.

261
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,200
The Central Aviation School came to Kunming.

262
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,110
The Kunming community, led by you,

263
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,960
handed over the Yunnan Aviation Division

264
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,759
and the aviation school

265
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,160
to the Aviation Commission.

266
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,839
You're taking care of the overall situation.

267
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,240
Let me put it this way.

268
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,160
If there is no Wujiaba Airport.

269
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,960
Central Aviation School may struggle.

270
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,880
You contributed money and effort.

271
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:53,839
Thank you so much.

272
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,920
Well.

273
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,759
On behalf of the aviation school,

274
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,039
I'd like to request the flight commission to

275
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,440
take a big credit for you.

276
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,279
Everyone is responsible to resist the Japanese army.

277
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,920
If the Japanese had taken Yunnan,

278
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,510
everything in this place will belong to the Japanese.

279
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,599
I did what I should have done.

280
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,960
Yunnan has made a huge contribution this time

281
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,079
and you deserve the credit.

282
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,319
By the way, as far as I know,

283
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,559
the Yunnan-Burma Highway alone,

284
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,270
the Executive Yuan has allocated at least
two million yuan.

285
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,350
So you've got the reputation and the money.

286
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,960
Both fame and wealth are achieved.

287
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,119
This is a very good thing

288
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,119
for Yunnan Province and for you personally.

289
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,279
Deputy Director Lu,

290
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,400
what do you mean?

291
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,240
It is not necessary to say it explicitly.

292
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,519
Good.

293
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:07,110
I came because I'd like to discuss with you about

294
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,200
the construction of the airfield.

295
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,039
Once the Yunnan-Burma Line

296
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,640
and the Yunnan-Vietnam Line are accessed,

297
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,680
the throughput must be large.

298
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,590
But land transport is vulnerable to the constraints.

299
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,319
That's why air transport is important.

300
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,310
Like you said, twenty-four airports are not enough.

301
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,680
What the aviation commission means is...

302
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,839
to continue to build the airports.

303
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,680
Deputy Director Lu,

304
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,790
I have to build roads and airports,

305
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,030
which has left my money bag empty.

306
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,160
Yes.

307
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,480
You find good land and submit applications,

308
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,440
I'll talk to the aviation commission.

309
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,559
With the help from the local banks,

310
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,119
the money is not a worry.

311
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,519
After all, it's about doing things for the country.

312
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,799
Deputy Director Lu,

313
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,000
please help talk to the aviation commission.

314
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,750
Let's go to see the land together someday.

315
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,480
Good.

316
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,310
It's good to have a conversation with you today.

317
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,200
I should go.

318
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,119
The guest has arrived.

319
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,839
I'm Okayama Shinichi,

320
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,599
Professor at the Department of Literature,

321
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,720
Tokyo Imperial University.

322
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,790
I come here today to visit you.

323
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,920
What nerve!

324
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,000
The two countries are at war, so we are enemies.

325
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,400
How dare a Japanese man come here?

326
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,599
I am just a scholar.

327
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,640
It is a bit inappropriate to come here at this time.

328
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,720
But I know that there is a Chinese saying

329
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,160
being polite.

330
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,519
I am a friendly guest.

331
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,039
Mr. Lu.

332
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,920
You don't have to be nervous, do you?

333
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,079
I should go.

334
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,079
Professor Okayama,

335
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
what brings you here?

336
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,079
It is regrettable that

337
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,000
there is some disagreement between our countries.

338
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,680
But I am an educated man.

339
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,070
The strife between nations is not my concern.

340
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,200
I only hope that the war will be put to rest

341
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,119
and peace will be restored soon.

342
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,680
I came all the way to Yunnan because I heard that

343
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,750
Fuhua University and Yanxi University in Peiping,

344
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,400
the most known institutions of higher learning

345
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,000
are gradually moving to Yunnan.

346
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,200
In the next few years,

347
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,750
Kunming will be the center of Chinese scholarship.

348
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,440
I'm working on a monograph that

349
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,550
arguing for the credibility of
the ancient history of China.

350
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,240
I heard that Professor Ling Wenyue of

351
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,079
the Department of History at Fuhua
is also working on it.

352
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,070
Professor Ling and I are both rivals and friends.

353
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,640
So here I am.

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,920
It's just a pity that

355
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,680
Mr. Ling has not yet arrived.

356
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,510
You are interested in the Chinese ancestors?

357
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:48,920
You may want to go to the Zhengyi Road

358
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,440
and Jinbi Street for a walk.

359
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,720
Ask the locals and you'll see.

360
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,310
In Yunnan, no matter what ethnicity we are,

361
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,720
we all identify with one ancestor,

362
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,640
who is called Zhuge Kongming.

363
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,000
If you ask them where their hometown is,

364
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,279
they will answer you

365
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,160
Nanjing, Yingtian Prefecture.

366
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,200
Supervisor Bai.

367
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,519
I found a place to stay in Kunming,

368
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,359
just waiting for Mr. Ling to arrive.

369
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,519
After all, I'm a Japanese.

370
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,960
Therefore, I came here today to report to you,

371
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,160
so as not to be accused of being a secret agent.

372
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,960
I want you to keep me safe.

373
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,240
Let me just say this.

374
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,510
As long as you do your studies honestly,

375
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,200
not to participate in matters that

376
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,480
endanger the security of our country,

377
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,030
your personal safety is not a problem in Yunnan.

378
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,000
But as far as I know,

379
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,310
in addition to doing academic research,

380
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,920
in the past few years,

381
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,279
you've also done some mineral business,

382
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,119
and you're doing really great.

383
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,640
I'm afraid it's not necessary for you to

384
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,070
come to me to ask for some protection.

385
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,680
Sir,

386
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,279
if you don't let me in,

387
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,240
can you go in and find Chunlai for me?

388
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,000
You just say his mother came to see him.

389
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,359
Sorry, we don't have this person here.

390
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,400
You are not allowed to enter, please leave.

391
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Please, I had a hard time...

392
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,160
Go away.

393
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,960
Sir?

394
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,680
Sir, please, please help me.

395
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,000
Please help me, please.

396
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,079
Help me.

397
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,440
Sir.

398
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,359
Sorry, you are?

399
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,720
I had a hard time finding this place.

400
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,270
I am Li Chunlai's mother. Do you know Li Chunlai?

401
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,440
Li Chunlai?

402
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,799
Sorry, there is no such person here.

403
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,070
So, can you go inside and ask for me?

404
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,720
Does anyone know him?

405
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,680
Don't worry.

406
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,279
Are you looking for the Central Aviation School

407
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,119
or the Yunnan Aviation School?

408
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,599
If it is the Yunnan Aviation School,

409
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,799
it has been moved to Liuzhou.

410
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,839
I can ask for the phone number for you.

411
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,559
It is the Central Aviation School,

412
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,079
which was moved from Hangzhou.

413
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,030
Li Chunlai, coming from Shanghai.

414
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,039
When did your son get enrolled in Jianqiao?

415
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,000
I don't know about that.

416
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,000
Sir,

417
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,319
when my son was six years old,

418
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,880
he was adopted by my cousin in Guangzhou.

419
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,960
But...

420
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,790
but after many years which I only know that

421
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,960
my cousin died a year after the kid went there.

422
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,830
I was trying to get back my poor child.

423
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,240
Last year, I took my youngest son to

424
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,480
my cousin's house in Guangzhou.

425
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,960
But they said he ran away at the age of fifteen.

426
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,350
Then my boy wrote a letter to my cousin's husband,

427
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,559
saying that he went to the Guangdong flight school,

428
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:19,680
which was incorporated into Jianqiao Aviation School.

429
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,160
So I took my youngest son to Hangzhou.

430
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,640
I heard that your whole school has moved to Kunming.

431
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,559
In Hangzhou,

432
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,240
I didn't find Chunlai,

433
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,720
and I lost my youngest son.

434
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,200
Don't worry, I'll help you look for him.

435
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,480
Thank you.

436
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,599
I suddenly remembered.

437
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,070
Could it be that, Li Chunlai,

438
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,680
was enrolled in with the other family name

439
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
written on his household registration booklet?

440
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,039
Ding.

441
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,359
What did you say? Ding?

442
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,400
Yes, Ding.

443
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,319
Captain!

444
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,720
There's someone you need to see.

445
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,000
Who is it?

446
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,640
Chief Zeng.

447
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,160
Auntie.

448
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,279
You're here, come in.

449
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:33,880
Okay.

450
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,519
Come on in.

451
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,920
Auntie, from now on, just call me Nianqiao.

452
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,119
Please sit down.

453
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,000
This is our captain, Zhang Qi.

454
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,000
This is...

455
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,000
I am Li Chunlai's mother.

456
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,960
You are Li Chunlai's officer?

457
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,000
Why didn't Chunlai come?

458
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,720
Come on, sit down.

459
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,720
Li Chunlai is?

460
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,640
She came over to visit her son, Li Chunlai.

461
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,480
Li Chunlai changed his last name here.

462
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,319
His last name was Ding.

463
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,119
Ding?

464
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,640
You mean, our second brother?

465
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,039
As an adopted son in Meizhou,

466
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,920
he ran away from home at the age of fifteen.

467
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,079
Transferred from Guangdong Aviation School.

468
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,759
And even the age matches.

469
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
That may not be the same person?

470
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,720
I have a letter here.

471
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:40,640
I was asked by him to

472
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,750
pass this letter to his mother before the war.

473
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,950
[From Li Wenshuyu]

474
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,799
Chief Zeng.

475
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,720
I can't read much.

476
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,319
Can you read it for me?

477
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,000
Xiaojiuhua grocery store,

478
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,200
Wangjia Dock Road, Shanghai.

479
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,759
To Li Wenshuyu.

480
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,640
Li Wenshuyu is me!

481
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,240
This is a letter to me!

482
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
That's him!

483
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,400
He has grown so big!

484
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,119
So handsome!

485
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:39,799
Look!

486
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,119
Look at his eyebrows,

487
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,070
they are exactly the same as his father's!

488
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,559
It's my son!

489
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Then I tell you.

490
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,359
In fact, I have changed my name.

491
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,880
I escaped from my adoptive father's house

492
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,640
when I was fifteen and wandered all the way.

493
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,960
Chief Zeng.

494
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,200
What did he write in the letter?

495
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,000
Okay.

496
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,079
Dear mother,

497
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,200
Since we parted from my early childhood,

498
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,079
I've been missing you every day.

499
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,319
I pray that I may see my loving mother again one day,

500
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,039
so that I will have the opportunity to be around you.

501
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,119
But I'm not a filial son in this life.

502
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,599
Never to see my mother again.

503
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,240
Because I have decided to
defend the enemy with my life.

504
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,440
The Japanese want to trample on our land

505
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,519
and bully our compatriots.

506
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,039
But only when they can step on my dead body!

507
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,590
I can't take care of you for the rest of my life.

508
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,590
However, we dare not be the sinners of our nation.

509
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,759
I hope that after reading this letter,

510
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,839
you won't be grieved for my death.

511
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:53,920
In the future,

512
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,110
when you knit, if you see a knot in the thread,

513
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,960
it must be me who come to see you.

514
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,550
Donglai, if you see a cluster of waves
in front of the beach,

515
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,079
it's me, your elder brother, who come to see you.

516
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,519
Your loving son.

517
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,599
I heard that

518
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,270
pilots will write a posthumous paper to the family

519
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,720
before the war.

520
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,599
And you will come back.

521
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,830
This is the kind of paper, right?

522
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,079
Sir,

523
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,359
has Chunlai come to Kunming?

524
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,359
Can you take me to meet him?

525
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,790
Did Chunlai get hurt?

526
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:09,959
He is not disabled, is he?

527
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,880
It's okay, take me to meet him.

528
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,679
As long as he is alive.

529
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,510
Go, let's go!

530
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:18,800
Auntie.

531
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,639
Ding...

532
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,360
Chunlai...

533
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,320
In the Battle of Jiangyin on 26th November last year...

534
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,760
he died.

535
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,760
In the Battle of Jiangyin,

536
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,039
all the other team members died.

537
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,119
Only I survived.

538
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,159
He tried to protect me.

539
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,119
He didn't make it back alive.

540
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:20,760
Chunlai.

541
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,760
He was Ding Huansheng here.

542
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,800
We all called him Second Brother.

543
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,630
He treated all of us like a real brother.

544
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:35,199
He would rather die than be a prisoner of war.

545
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:38,880
He's a hero.

546
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,000
Chunlai!

547
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,360
Chunlai!

548
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,079
Chunlai!

549
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,719
Mr. Lu.

550
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,119
It's been a long time.

551
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,639
Come, have a seat.

552
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,400
I checked your identity.

553
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,440
There is no such person as you
at Tokyo Imperial University.

554
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,030
I know your identity that others don't know.

555
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,039
Member of the Maochuan Secret Service,

556
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,119
Member of Panlong Society of Japan.

557
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,639
Slaughtering expatriates and acting as
undercover agents.

558
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,630
Stealing maps, inciting mutiny and starting a war.

559
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:01,550
Panlong Society has done a lot of dirty work
over the years.

560
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,559
I'm here today to

561
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,440
verify your identity

562
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,559
and take you back to investigate.

563
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,230
You can only be shot due to the violent resistance.

564
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,400
3031, 5th Street, Higashi-Komatsugawa, Tokyo.

565
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,119
Mr. Lu.

566
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,760
Are you familiar with this address?

567
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,119
Kazuhiko Kato.

568
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,119
He is about to graduate from high school.

569
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,960
I heard that he is quite good at study.

570
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,840
There is a good chance that

571
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,760
he will be admitted to Tokyo Imperial University.

572
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,480
I was told that the kid had only one Japanese mother.

573
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,960
But every month, someone sends her money from China.

574
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,079
Coincidentally,

575
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,280
the person who sent the money

576
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,639
has the same last name as you,

577
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,800
Lu.

578
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,190
It seems that this kid should also be named Lu.

579
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,639
Mr. Lu?

580
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,559
Mr. Lu.

581
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,239
I know how you feel about that.

582
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:40,110
You helped me buy the oracle earlier.

583
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:42,710
You started a mineral business in Yunnan for me.

584
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,800
But recently, the mineral business in Yunnan

585
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,440
was taken over by Supervisor Bai
as a government office.

586
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,559
There is no profit for you.

587
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,519
Kazuhiko

588
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,030
has nothing to do with this matter.

589
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:57,760
Look.

590
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:03,710
Kazuhiko is a really handsome boy.

591
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:08,320
I am sure he will get into Tokyo Imperial University.

592
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,360
As long as you cooperates with me.

593
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,960
Let's find oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

594
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,960
By that time, Mr. Lu,

595
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,710
you can take them wherever you want to go.

596
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,079
Good.

597
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,159
Mr. Okayama.

598
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,719
Then it is a deal.

599
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:42,960
Oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

600
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,400
I will help you find it.

601
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,230
Do you have any clue?

602
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,599
Now it seems that

603
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,320
Ling Wenyue lost Oracle bone inscriptions
of Wuding in Hangzhou.

604
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,000
But I'm not sure whether it's true or not.

605
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,760
I am going to perform a play with him to see it.

606
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,480
Stop!

607
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,559
Our boxes!

608
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,119
Ling!

609
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,760
Stop!

610
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,440
Ling!

611
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:15,679
Are you...

612
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,559
Help me chase them!

613
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:17,480
Are you out of your mind?

614
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,880
There are many bandits in this area.

615
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,360
If they want the luggage, leave it.

616
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,159
Why are you chasing them?

617
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,440
No, there are oracle bone rubbings!

618
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,719
Ling!

619
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Stop!

620
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,840
My boxes!

621
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:36,960
Where are they?

622
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,119
These guys!

623
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,230
What's in there is more important than my life!

624
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,840
They are gone?

625
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,480
Over there!

626
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,519
Over there!

627
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,719
Come on!

628
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:53,760
Ling!

629
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Come and help me!

630
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,150
I need to find a place to dry these out.

631
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,800
Yeah, or they're all broken.

632
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,719
Be careful.

633
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
You guys, be careful too.

634
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,079
Go.

635
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,159
Be careful.

636
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:36,920
Watch out!

637
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,480
Jiang Zeqing, holding Bu.

638
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,519
Okay.

639
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,679
Bu! Come.

640
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,639
Bu.

641
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,480
What's wrong, Donglai?

642
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,079
I miss my brother.

643
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,920
You said your brother is also in Jianqiao.

644
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,880
When we arrive in Kunming,

645
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,119
Yuanyin will go to find Poshan,

646
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,150
you can go to your brother, and I'll go to Zhang Qi.

647
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,670
Okay, it's a deal.

648
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,719
Let's go.

649
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,559
Come on, keep up.

650
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,599
Leap month in the middle of the year?

651
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,880
Again?

652
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,639
During the reigning of Zu Geng and Zu Jia,

653
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,119
there was leap month in the middle of the year.

654
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:27,199
Then this leap month...

655
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:31,800
I think I miscalculated.

656
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,800
What are you talking about?

657
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,110
What's the difference then?

658
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,199
Dairong.

659
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,230
In Chinese, the word Zhong refers to the middle.

660
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,400
Not the one refers to the end.

661
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,880
By the way, you know what?

662
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:49,710
January was named the first month of the lunar new year

663
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,559
on the oracle-bone inscriptions of Zu Jia.

664
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,280
Sister!

665
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:56,280
Sister!

666
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,320
Haichen?

667
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,980
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

668
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:16,880
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

669
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:24,330
♫ Shed tears to our sweet love ♫

670
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:32,810
♫ The date of return is yet to come ♫

671
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,980
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

672
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,810
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

673
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:47,810
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

674
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:55,060
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

675
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,860
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

676
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:09,010
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

677
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:20,710
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫

678
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,960
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

679
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,480
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

680

♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

681

♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

683
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:11,980
