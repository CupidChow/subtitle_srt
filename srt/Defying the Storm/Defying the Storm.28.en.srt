[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,420
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,700
Father.

4
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,100
Materials for hydrogen production are too limited.

5
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,180
Fortunately, you told us to get aluminum from planes.

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,820
You help us a lot.

7
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,460
Your father is not a fool.

8
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,260
Such easy chemical principles can't baffle me.

9
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,420
Is it the plan of the engine?

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,780
You've learned something.

11
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,540
Nianqiao.

12
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,060
Now the British have developed jet fighters.

13
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,140
They use turbines.

14
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,980
Their speed can reach 900 miles per hour.

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,860
It's so unbelievable.

16
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,340
I don't think I'm foolish

17
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,100
so how can't I develop such fighters?

18
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,460
I believe you can.

19
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,500
He's right.

20
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,660
Jet fighters will replace propeller fighters.

21
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,500
It will be the key to success.

22
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,900
Sir, could we develop our own turbines?

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,140
If not, what am I doing here?

24
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,500
Sir.

25
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,540
Can we use this formula in the turbine design?

26
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,740
If you're capable, why not come and develop it?

27
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,020
Calm down. He's always like this.

28
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,860
- Mr. Zeng.
- Leave me alone.

29
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,780
Ministry of Education has said

30
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,540
as long as you decide to publish
"Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar",

31
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,460
they'll earmark funds for our school.

32
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,620
We now need more and more funds.

33
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,100
Catch the time.

34
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,180
Fine. I'll grab the time to proofread it.

35
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,700
Okay. I'll go to discuss with the bank.

36
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,940
Meng, it counts on you.

37
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,340
Everyone.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,580
Now it's the heat of the war

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,420
and also the most difficult time for us.

40
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,420
I want to tell you something
about two countries in Northern Europe.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,620
They show us opposite attitudes

42
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,380
when facing aggression.

43
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,100
First is Denmark.

44
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,660
When the German troops attacked them,

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,900
Danish troops had only resisted for four hours

46
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,100
and then they proclaimed to surrender.

47
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,820
So Germany conquered it smoothly.

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,740
The other country is called Norway.

49
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,340
Germany thought it should be easy to occupy it.

50
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,220
Anyhow,

51
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,860
Norwegian armies fought against desperately.

52
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,100
Germans even lost

53
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,820
their cruisers on Norwegian coastline.

54
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,660
A few months later,

55
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,980
because they're mismatched,

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,540
Haakon II was compelled to
transfer his government to the north.

57
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,220
Even if he's in the north,

58
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,940
he still persisted in commanding
his underground troops

59
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,180
to resist the aggressors.

60
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,220
The most classical sentence from him is

61
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:18,860
"a nation which yields to aggressors should not exist".

62
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,380
That's all.

63
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,220
Nice!

64
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,660
Qianying.

65
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,500
Come back with me. Right now.

66
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,860
Dad.

67
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,820
Dad, what's the matter with you?

68
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,820
Dad, what's going on?

69
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,300
Dad!

70
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,820
Go home at once.

71
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,700
Dad, don't get angry.

72
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,620
You're so absurd.

73
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,940
She gave her handkerchief to Zeng Nianqiao

74
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,660
in front of the public!

75
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,740
I'm afraid she's given her heart to him

76
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,060
but she hasn't realized it!

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,580
Come on, my dear.

78
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,100
Why are both of you so weird?

79
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,740
Can you be rational?

80
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,180
How can I be rational?

81
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,380
You didn't see her smile and expression toward him!

82
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,060
You've raised her for years
but why haven't I seen her do this to you?

83
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,340
So how can I be sober?

84
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,180
Don't!

85
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,500
What are you doing?

86
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,900
I carried it from Peiping.

87
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,580
If you break it,

88
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,340
you can only use a bowl to drink later on.

89
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,140
She's been mollycoddled by you from childhood

90
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,300
and she's never seen you're angry like this.

91
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,460
When she grows up,

92
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,460
she'll find someone she likes.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,380
When can she grow up?

94
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,180
She's still a kid!

95
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,420
It's just like loving flowers or kittens.

96
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,420
It's not real love.

97
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,020
Come here and have a seat.

98
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,620
Do you want her to stay with us forever?

99
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,580
I can support her!

100
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,220
What nonsense are you saying?

101
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,140
Who's the wayward kid in our family?

102
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,500
She's 20.

103
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,700
It's nominal age.

104
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,860
I remember I was with you when I was 17.

105
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,420
At that time, you were only 25,

106
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,620
just like Nianqiao.

107
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,260
If you don't like him,

108
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,340
fine,

109
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,740
we still know other excellent boys,

110
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,660
such as your students.

111
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,380
You can find...

112
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,340
Enough!

113
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,460
It seems Zeng...

114
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,820
Mr. Zeng's son is better than them...

115
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,580
Your bark is worse than your bite.

116
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Lanshan.

117
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,180
I'm just worried

118
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,220
if she really marries someone and leaves us,

119
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,220
how deserted our family will be?

120
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,740
Are we waiting for such an end
after raising her for years?

121
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,060
Do you remember that day when I married you?

122
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,060
My father was crying all the way.

123
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,940
Then when he gave us the thank-you speech,

124
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,660
he choked with sobs,

125
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,300
almost losing his tongue.

126
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,220
It's become a joke talked by my relatives after that.

127
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,380
Of course, I remember.

128
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,700
While he proposed a toast to others,

129
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,820
the glass shook in his hands.

130
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,020
The wine was spilled out.

131
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,620
Others said he was on purpose and not sincere.

132
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,380
That's it.

133
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,420
Actually, Qianying is a good girl.

134
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,140
Even if she gets married,

135
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,740
she'll often come back and visit us, right?

136
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,860
Of course, she will.

137
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,260
She's our daughter forever.

138
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,060
And also you're always the man
who loves her the most in the world.

139
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,660
Of course.

140
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,700
Come in.

141
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,100
Dad.

142
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,060
Fried tiddlers.

143
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,700
Smells so good!

144
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,100
No.

145
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,100
Dad, you've worked hard

146
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,380
so you need the nutrition.

147
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,140
I don't want it.

148
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,500
I nearly burned my hand in order to fry the fish.

149
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,580
What's going on?

150
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,460
Where did you burn?

151
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,340
Why are you so careless?

152
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,340
Does it hurt?

153
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,220
Dad, I mean "nearly".

154
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,260
I know you are concerned about me.

155
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,540
You naughty girl.

156
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,860
- Try some.
- No.

157
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,660
Beware of fish-bones.

158
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,860
Tasty?

159
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,780
Unexpectedly, not bad.

160
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,780
That's it. Because I'm her daughter.

161
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,660
Qianying.

162
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,220
Did you really make it yourself?

163
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,060
Tell me the truth.

164
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,420
No.

165
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,660
I know you well. How can you do housework?

166
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,140
You can't either, can you?

167
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,420
And you can't cook.

168
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,580
Last time when you changed the tablecloth,
you spilled the ink, right?

169
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,540
I'm your daughter so I'm the same as you.

170
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,220
Then why can't you learn from my advantages?

171
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,180
Why do you always say so?

172
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,060
Do you want one?

173
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,220
No, thanks.

174
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,260
Where do you get the tiddlers?

175
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,300
Zeng Nianqiao caught them in the river.

176
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,380
He asked me to bring you the first batch.

177
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,580
I won't eat it anymore!

178
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,980
He wants to marry my daughter
by some worthless tiddlers?

179
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,820
How bad he is!

180
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:03,980
I see.

181
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,340
You knew it.

182
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,220
You've collaborated with her, right?

183
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,140
I'm the one who knows nothing, right?

184
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,980
Tell me.

185
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,940
Dad.

186
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,260
You're the best dad in the world.

187
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,300
I know you care about me a lot.

188
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,580
You're the first one that I love

189
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,780
and you'll be my favorite forever.

190
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,900
- You see.
- I've taught her nothing about it.

191
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,300
She's inherited from you.

192
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,700
From me?

193
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,740
- Of course.
- What?

194
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,980
How many love words did you say to me
when you were pursuing me?

195
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,900
Really? What did he say? Tell me!

196
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,380
How can you mention it before our kid?

197
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,780
Dad, tell me!

198
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,820
I want to know it.

199
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:47,940
Qianying, be good.

200
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,740
I have two questions to ask you.

201
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,860
You've fallen in love with Zeng Nianqiao, right?

202
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,340
But does he like you?

203
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,940
He doesn't like you?

204
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,900
No. I didn't ask him before.

205
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,620
Dad, did I do anything wrong?

206
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,860
How should I tell you about it?

207
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,740
You're now an adult

208
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,940
and are you ready

209
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,100
to love someone?

210
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,740
Yes.

211
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,900
Yes, mom.

212
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,460
Qianying.

213
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,780
You're not wrong.

214
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,980
Dad and mom won't oppose you.

215
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,220
Come on. Go to bed first, my girl.

216
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,500
It's getting late now.

217
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,820
Good night, dad.

218
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,940
Good night, mom.

219
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,100
Good night.

220
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,220
Hold on a second.

221
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,460
Here you are.

222
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,860
Eat more.

223
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,420
It's a good thing to know it.

224
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,020
Not bad.

225
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,660
What can I do with the grief? Beyond belief.

226
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,220
A piece of news about culture.

227
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,740
Professor Ling Wenyue from School of
Chinese Studies in Fuhua University

228
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,700
will publish "Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar"
in Kunming soon.

229
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,300
I've heard that

230
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,500
Ling Wenyue will hold
a formal news conference next week.

231
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,980
He rewrites "Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar".

232
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,300
Supervisor Bai asks men to protect him everyday.

233
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,500
I can't ask men to attack him evidently.

234
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,860
You must get oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

235
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,980
As long as Ling Wenyue doesn't have it,

236
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,140
then his study can't be proven.

237
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,540
Understand, Mr. Lu?

238
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,340
Mr. Okayama.

239
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,020
I have no clue about it.

240
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,020
If I have any, I will absolutely help you.

241
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,700
I'm afraid we can't get the deal this time.

242
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,660
Mr. Lu.

243
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,700
I forgot to tell you something.

244
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,740
The oil field in Jing'an that I sent you
made a profit last month.

245
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,540
I've remitted money
to your family in Japan by Yangon Bank.

246
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,180
I think they've received it, right?

247
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,180
By the way,

248
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,140
I've learned that

249
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,820
there's a Military Commission in your nation.

250
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,460
They've had an order
to eliminate traitors for two years.

251
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,260
Such as Zhang Xiaolin and Fu Xiao'an.

252
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,940
They've killed many people who are friendly to Japan.

253
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,260
Mr. Lu.

254
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,460
Think of it.

255
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,100
If they know we've got along with
each other for many years,

256
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,860
what will they do to you?

257
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,100
I think you want me to be with you forever.

258
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,860
Anyhow, no one forced you to be on my side at that time.

259
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,540
Lu Ziyi, you should make up your mind now.

260
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,020
It's impossible for you to be on both sides.

261
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,500
There are only two ways for you now.

262
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,700
First is continuing to help me

263
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,260
and you can reunite with your wife and son
in Japan later on.

264
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,420
Second is to be executed by them

265
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,020
and you'll be their everlasting shame.

266
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,940
Choose one yourself, Mr. Lu.

267
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,300
Goodbye.

268
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,180
Anyone?

269
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,660
Director.

270
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,060
Ask Chief Xu to come here.

271
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,660
Yes.

272
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,180
I've checked your office every day
according to your demand.

273
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,620
I promise there's no bug here.

274
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,260
Director.

275
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,380
Should we stop contacting the Japanese?

276
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,660
I don't think we need to
sacrifice our lives to earn money.

277
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,900
How do you think of it?

278
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,860
In this world,

279
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,500
a thief will be killed

280
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,380
but a traitor will get fortune and position.

281
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,180
Executing a collaborator is to warn the people.

282
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,860
Even Generalissimo himself
negotiates with Japanese Command.

283
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,020
As long as he promises Manchukuo
will fight against CPC

284
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,980
and Chongqing will collaborate with Wang Jingwei,

285
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,580
Japan will retreat its troops.

286
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,420
If he hadn't worried the people
would smash up Chongqing government,

287
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,540
he would have signed up his name.

288
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,700
Director, you mean...

289
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,900
Let me tell you something directly.

290
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,300
Though you don't tackle too many things,
it's still hard for you to get rid.

291
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,860
The Commission will kill you if they know it.

292
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,900
You can't only think of earning money every day.

293
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,980
Open up your mind and sight

294
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,020
and then be a heartless man.

295
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,700
My bro.

296
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,660
Wherever a wolf goes, its goal is to have meat.

297
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,100
You need to be persistent like that.

298
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,780
Only a merciless man can be a real man.

299
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,460
One last thing.

300
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,620
Only when you're strong enough,
then no one dares to hurt you.

301
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,620
I see, Director.

302
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,620
But, I really know nothing about the oracle bone.

303
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,220
What next?

304
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,780
From the reporter, Xiao Hong'en.

305
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,260
Intellectuals always pretend to be reluctant.

306
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,140
You need to punish them first.

307
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,860
Otherwise, we can't find it forever.

308
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,980
Yes.

309
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,620
I'll do it right now.

310
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,780
[Xinzhi Newspaper Office]

311
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,660
I'm going to the printing house.

312
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,380
- Focus on your work.
- Okay.

313
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,780
I've hidden one thing from your sister.

314
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,300
If she knows someday, I promise she'll be in shock.

315
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,980
Maybe she'll think I'm so extraordinary.

316
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,020
What is it?

317
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,900
I won't tell you.

318
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,460
Unless you eat it first.

319
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,540
I refuse.

320
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,820
Come on. I'll tell you.

321
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,260
You're her brother

322
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,620
and also my homie.

323
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,780
I trust you.

324
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,340
It was a secret among me, my brother and Nianqiao.

325
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,380
There's an oracle bone

326
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,180
called oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

327
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,660
Wuding?

328
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,100
I brought it from Hangzhou to Kunming.

329
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,500
Without me, it would be in that man's hand.

330
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,860
So you're the thief in Yue Temple, right?

331
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,140
Yes.

332
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,020
So that's why I think you look familiar.

333
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,260
Have you given it back to Uncle Ling?

334
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Have some noodles first.

335
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,740
Hong'en!

336
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,100
Hong'en!

337
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,380
Why are you here?

338
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,180
Come and sit.

339
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,580
Have you had a meal? Let me treat you.

340
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,180
I do feel hungry now.

341
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,060
Thank you but let me invite you this time.

342
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,780
Sir. A bowl of rice noodles.

343
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,180
- More spicy sauce.
- Okay.

344
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,980
Brother, I'm afraid you can't imagine it.

345
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,300
What is it?

346
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,020
Do you remember the thief
who stole Uncle Ling's box in Yue Temple?

347
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,220
It's Li Donglai.

348
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,620
What?

349
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,740
Really?

350
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,940
You are really capable.

351
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,620
Thank you.

352
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,060
So have you given it back to Uncle Ling?

353
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,260
He's anxious about it.

354
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,580
He's been in a trance for days, right?

355
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,500
I lost it on the way when I fled from calamity.

356
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,300
By the way, where did you go?

357
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,660
I went to send the final sample.

358
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,940
What about you two?

359
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,660
I went to fetch the weather forecast.

360
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,820
Qi needs it.

361
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,580
How's his relationship with Haitang?

362
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,380
Pretty nice. Why did you ask it?

363
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,140
Nothing else. I just wonder why they haven't married yet.

364
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,580
I'm just concerned about them.

365
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,780
Don't worry.

366
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,220
He only cares about the war and my sister.

367
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,860
He has no time to think of other women.

368
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,740
His way to express love is different from others.

369
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,740
Haven't you seen the windbell
before my sister's window?

370
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,100
How can I get the chance to be in her room?

371
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,940
What's the matter?

372
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,740
You know she likes oracle bone, right?

373
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,180
He made a small piece of oracle bone
into a windbell and sent it to her.

374
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,700
Once, I slipped into her room

375
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,540
and asked her about its meaning.

376
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,980
She only told me it's an allusion.

377
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,900
And she didn't tell me who sent it to her.

378
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,660
By the way,

379
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,460
there are three red scratches on...

380
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,660
Haichen.

381
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,540
I want to ask you something.

382
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,620
Does your school recruit students recently?

383
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,380
I'll go to ask about it.

384
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,700
Okay.

385
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,140
Remember.

386
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,540
Help us find oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

387
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,340
There are three red scratches on its back.

388
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,340
We all finished.

389
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,100
Where are you going? I'll go back to the office.

390
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,900
- I'm back to Aviation School.
- So am I.

391
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,860
Well, not the same way. I have to leave first.

392
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,340
Sir.

393
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,460
- See you, cousin.
- See you, Hong'en.

394
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,460
- Shall we leave?
-Okay.

395
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,860
Take care.

396
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,220
I need to warn you something.

397
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,660
Tell nobody anything about oracle bone or other bones.

398
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,300
Even if it's your cousin.

399
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,660
Let's go.

400
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,260
This way, Editor Xiao.

401
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,900
Editor Xiao, I've been waiting for you for long.

402
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,460
I've given you what you want.

403
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,220
What do you want this time?

404
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,900
I can't agree with you.

405
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,460
What our director wants is more than a manuscript.

406
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,660
I really can find nothing about
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

407
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,380
You can know nothing about it

408
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,940
so how can a small reporter like me know it?

409
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,140
You're not a small reporter.

410
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:53,660
You're the editor of Xinzhi Times.

411
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,620
You can't get rid of us before you get it.

412
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,140
I really can't find it.

413
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,460
Besides,

414
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,940
I don't think I should keep on helping you.

415
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,580
Kill me or torture me as you want.

416
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,340
I won't kill you.

417
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,860
I will only tell the public

418
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,100
that you've stolen Ling Wenyue's manuscript

419
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,580
and given it to the Japanese.

420
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,340
What?

421
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,220
You gave it to the Japanese?

422
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,260
Shouldn't you do things for the government?

423
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,580
Giving it to the Japanese
is doing things for the government.

424
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,380
You know nothing.

425
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,900
Well, that's right.

426
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,260
As you can't understand what we're doing,

427
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,180
our people can't know it either.

428
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,580
So they will think

429
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,580
the chief editor of Xinzhi Times

430
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,220
who appeals against traitors is a real traitor.

431
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,460
You!

432
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,660
Do you have any clues about it?

433
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,740
I see.

434
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,100
Put it away first.

435
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,740
So many people here.

436
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,900
Don't hurt them.

437
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,820
I...

438
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,340
I did see it somewhere before.

439
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,620
Three red scratches, right?

440
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,980
Director! I got it!

441
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,500
Zhang Qi did it! Here you are.

442
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,100
Come on. Take your time.

443
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,940
Xiao Hong'en said Zhang Qi has done a handwork
made of tortoise shell.

444
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,220
There are three red scratches on it.

445
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,060
He must have seen it before!

446
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,380
Director, do you remember Jin Zhilie's assistant?

447
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,780
He said Jin Zhilie gave it to his old friend.

448
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,980
We only investigated Ling Wenyue,
Meng Wuran and Zeng Nianqiao.

449
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,900
We didn't remember his name!

450
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,060
I've checked his resume.

451
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,020
He only mentioned the military school in America.

452
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,740
He entered there in 1933.

453
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,540
His former name is Zhang Bai'an.

454
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:19,020
- Guess. What's his former school?
- Go ahead.

455
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,100
I found a man in Fuhua University

456
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,820
to check the student lists

457
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,940
from 1930 to 1933.

458
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,460
Though he didn't find Zhang Qi,

459
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,820
he found Zhang Bai'an

460
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,180
in physics department.

461
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,500
So Zhang Qi is from Fuhua?

462
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,020
Jin Zhilie is the professor of Fuhua.

463
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,500
Maybe they've known each other long ago.

464
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,940
That's it.

465
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,740
On June 16th, 1937,

466
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,780
10 days before we catching Zeng Nianqiao,

467
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,940
Zhang Qi did fly to Peiping.

468
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,860
That's why he started to aim at me.

469
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,180
Director, the conference of Ling Wenyue's

470
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,860
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar
will be held in two days...

471
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,180
Shall we?

472
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,740
Do what he asked us.

473
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,820
It's not included in our task.

474
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,820
Okayama Shinichi will solve it himself.

475
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,220
Yes.

476
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,140
[Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar]

477
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,420
Pile them higher.

478
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,140
Then it will look better.

479
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,060
Dad, Hong'en is here.

480
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,140
Have a seat.

481
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Secretary General Meng, Supervisor Bai arrives.

482
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,020
Secretary General Meng.

483
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,460
Supervisor Bai.

484
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,020
I must attend such a significant event.

485
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:38,980
Thank you so much.

486
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,340
Dad, I'll go to the front first.

487
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,820
Mr. Meng.

488
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,300
Secretary General Meng,

489
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,460
It seems that Professor Ling compiles the study...

490
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,620
Actually, emperors of Yin Dynasty...

491
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,700
Zhenzhu, come and sit.

492
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,900
It can prove that Yin Dynasty does exist.

493
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,860
Haitang, let me help you.

494
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,500
It's so amazing.

495
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,740
Though the writer is Professor Ling,

496
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,100
Secretary General Meng also spent years on it.

497
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,620
Professor Ling Wenyue and Professor Jin Zhilie

498
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,540
contribute the most.

499
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,940
I've just done a few things to serve them.

500
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,500
Secretary General Meng.

501
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,500
Let me introduce him to you.

502
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,940
This is President Hu from Fudian New Bank.

503
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,860
Nice to meet you, President Hu.

504
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,940
President Hu, I've told you that

505
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,100
it's Yunnan's luck to have Fuhua in Kunming.

506
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,780
"Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar"

507
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,420
could prove that Kunming is
the cultural foundation of the whole Asia.

508
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,780
You're quite right.

509
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,660
Fudian New Bank brings no present to celebrate.

510
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,140
A certified check for your school.

511
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,620
Let me thank you in the name of Fuhua.

512
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,420
This way, please.

513
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,340
- Professor Ling arrives.
- Our leading role is here.

514
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,340
Thank you so much.

515
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,300
- Supervisor Bai.
- Professor Ling.

516
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,900
- This way.
- Please.

517
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,420
Report.

518
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,620
Enemy planes have entered Yunnan.

519
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,180
Eight Mitsubishi G3M NELL and two A6M Zero.

520
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,420
Zeng Nianqiao, the wind direction is as usual.

521
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,580
Release all the floating bombs at the destination.

522
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,020
Fighter on duty waits for my order.

523
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,100
095 got it.

524
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,940
075 is ready for launch.

525
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,180
Thank you for attending

526
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,660
the conference of "Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar".

527
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,540
Please allow me to introduce it to you.

528
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,260
In 1930,

529
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,620
Fuhua Professor Jin Zhilie and I

530
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,220
found plenty of tortoise shells
and animal bones with words on them

531
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,020
at Village Xiaotun of Anyang in Henan.

532
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,340
- Mr. Ling.
- During...

533
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,340
I'm afraid you're lying.

534
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,820
I'm Okayama Shinichi.

535
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,980
Japanese! Get out of here!

536
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,860
You are not welcomed here!

537
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,780
Get out!

538
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,620
He's a scholar

539
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,580
and also our friend.

540
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,700
Please calm down.

541
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,620
I've met him several times.

542
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,380
As he's a scholar

543
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,180
and here's the hall for scholars,

544
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:47,780
we should let him tell us what he wants to express.

545
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,700
Please.

546
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,300
Mr. Ling.

547
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,020
I've spent a long journey to come here
and to ask you several questions.

548
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,740
Please go ahead.

549
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,940
Do you admit your work is to calculate

550
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,300
the reign of emperors
of Yin Dynasty and calendar of events?

551
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,740
You set forth your views based on
the tortoise shell that you found in 1930, right?

552
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,980
It's called oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding, right?

553
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,540
That's it.

554
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,260
It's significant evidence.

555
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,100
Then can you show us the shell?

556
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,260
Unfortunately, I lost it in Hangzhou.

557
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,140
It means you have no evidence, right?

558
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,940
So how can you write this book?

559
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,220
Mr. Okayama.

560
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,420
Our demonstration was that

561
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,180
we found the name of the diviner on the shell

562
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,860
and then collected different shells
with the same name.

563
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,900
After that, we found their inner connection.

564
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:22,180
We completed the two-fold proof based on
historical objects, materials and records.

565
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,860
According to our deduction,

566
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,540
the shell should come from
Wuding period of Yin Dynasty.

567
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,700
Then how can you know the diviner is from Wuding period?

568
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:42,300
Because there are three scratches on
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

569
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,860
which represents the record of a meteor shower.

570
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,020
It means stars flit towards the west.

571
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,900
The meteor shower could be confirmed
by our historical materials.

572
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,500
Wuding period did have a vast meteor shower.

573
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,500
Then we get the conclusion

574
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,500
that the shell is from Wuding period of Yin Dynasty.

575
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,020
Fine. Mr. Ling.

576
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,100
I only have one last question.

577
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,260
Why didn't they use words to note
the record of a meteor shower?

578
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,260
Why scratches?

579
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,700
Mr. Ling.

580
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,420
Enemy fighters are coming!

581
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,260
Don't be flustered. Let's scatter.

582
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,100
Professor Meng, ask students and professors
to enter air-raid shelter.

583
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,260
Go to air-raid shelter!

584
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,860
Professor Ling!

585
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,180
- My girl.
- Don't think too much. Let's go.

586
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,100
Go!

587
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,100
075, take off.

588
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,380
075 got it.

589
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,620
3000 meters high.

590
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,020
280 miles per hour.

591
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,420
Hold on heading 110.

592
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,900
Nice course, altitude and speed.

593
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,100
Enemy fighters will soon get into Kunming.

594
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,700
I've seen them.

595
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,020
Floating bombs are ready.

596
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,620
075, guide them. Keep a safe distance.

597
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,580
They'll arrive in the area in 10 seconds.

598
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,140
Ready to detonate them.

599
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,380
What are these?

600
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,900
Weather balloons?

601
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,220
A Mitsubishi G3M NELL has been ruined.

602
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,820
A wing of a Mitsubishi G3M NELL is damaged.

603
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,380
Enemy fighters retreat.

604
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,940
Why does the wind direction change?

605
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,340
Southeast wind...

606
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,900
Oh, no.

607
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,740
Floating bomb area moves towards the northwest.

608
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,860
We lost the aerial shield.

609
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,260
Repeat again. We lost the aerial shield.

610
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,260
What bad luck! They're turning around!

611
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,020
Ask 075 to come back at once!

612
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,140
075, retreat.

613
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,180
Zeng Nianqiao, detonate the remaining floating bombs.

614
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,600
Beware of accidental injury to people.

615
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,500
Yes.

616
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,540
095 received. I'll complete it at once.

617
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,540
The heaven doesn't want us to win the battle.

618
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,060
One is ruined and another is hurt.

619
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,340
Zhang Qi, you've done all you can.

620
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:48,380
Minister, the morale of the enemy is low now.

621
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,900
Hanguang Squadron applies to fight.

622
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,660
There are two A6M Zero there. I reject it.

623
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,180
Do you want to see another tragedy this time?

624
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,900
I've taught you to endure.

625
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,820
Its Chinese character consists of a knife and a heart.

626
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,780
If we keep on doing nothing but enduring,

627
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,460
the "knife" will cut into our "heart".

628
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,300
If Lou Shide hadn't fought eight times with Tubo,

629
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,540
then what he said about endurance was just a joke.

630
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,740
If we stop continuing our victory today

631
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,740
and show our cowardice to enemies again,

632
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,340
they will think our nation is easy to conquer.

633
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,980
I can't agree with it.

634
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,300
The general strategy is to avoid battles.

635
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,580
If you want to fight, it means to violate the rules.

636
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:31,980
Fine, I'll accept all the punishment.

637
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,860
It's nothing to do with you

638
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,660
and Hanguang Squadron.

639
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,220
Only courage can make our enemies scared.

640
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,700
Dad, go inside.

641
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,700
Guys, hurry up!

642
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,700
Speed up!

643
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,020
Get inside!

644
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,260
Come on!

645
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:19,420
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

646
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:27,320
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

647
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:34,770
♫ Shed tears to our sweet love ♫

648
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:43,250
♫ The date of return is yet to come ♫

649
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,420
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

650
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,250
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

651
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:58,250
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

652
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:05,500
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫
