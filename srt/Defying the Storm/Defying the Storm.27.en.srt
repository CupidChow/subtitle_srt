[Episode 27]

3
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,400
There is one.

4
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,280
Look, this is Pegasus.

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,680
This is its Alpha, Beta, Gamma,

6
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,359
With the Alpha of Andromeda next to it,

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,239
do they look like a diamond?

8
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,319
This token is eternal,

9
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,960
and the vow is eternal.

10
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,800
Haitang,

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,360

12
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,599
I'll marry you right away.

♫ The breeze blows, time flies ♫

♫ Missing grows wings and flies to the sky ♫

24
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,759
Is there a man named Xu Te

25
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,360
in your Aviation School?

26
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,240
Xu Te,

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,560
he's from Political Discipline Department.

28
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,080
A section chief?

29
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,800
Yes, what's wrong?

30
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,120
I'm not sure.

31
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,919
But I have some doubts.

32
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,000
Where does your fuel come from?

33
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,599
Usually from Yumen Oilfield.

34
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,390
However, the output of Yumen is not enough,

35
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,950
and most of them still need to be imported.

36
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,079
I saw some fuel tax returns from my dad,

37
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,439
and several shipments

38
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,519
came from a place called Jing'an in northern Myanmar.

39
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
The person who filled out the tax returns was Xu Te.

40
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,610
Why did Political Discipline Department

41
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,680
interfere in the fuel issue?

42
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,160
So,

43
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,839
if there's a chance,

44
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,560
I'd like you to check

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,920
if there's a problem with the fuel.

46
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,439
Okay, I got it.

47
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,839
Where's Chen Mengwen?

48
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,839
She was just dancing,

49
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,950
and her book bag is still here,

50
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,720
but she's gone.

51
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,199
Why is she gone?

52
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,279
Mom.

53
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,240
Hi,

54
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,839
Chen Mengwen is from this village, right?

55
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,439
Why did she suddenly go home

56
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,199
and not go to school?

57
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,959
This is a letter from Chen Mengwen's family.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,360
She wrote the withdrawal letter.

59
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,879
She's not going to study.

60
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
She's getting married today.

61
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,800
Where is her home?

62
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,480
We'll go to find her.

63
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,160
This house.

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

65
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,439
Slow down.

66
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,879
Be careful.

67
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,439
Chen Mengwen.

68
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:05,920
Be careful.

69
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,560
Chen Mengwen.

70
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,439
Chen Mengwen.

71
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,079
Chen Mengwen.

72
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,079
Chen Mengwen.

73
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,160
We need to talk to you.

74
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,439
What are you guys doing?

75
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,519
Don't delay my daughter's wedding.

76
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,560
You don't want Mengwen to study

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,399
because she's a girl,

78
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,200
then you're forcing your daughter to get married.

79
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,079
Well,

80
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,800
Bai Fei, Supervisor Bai, you know him, don't you?

81
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,439
I'll let him pay Chen Mengwen's tuition.

82
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,879
Don't force her to get married.

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
Chen Mengwen,

84
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,639
go back to school with us.

85
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,959
Yes, come back with us.

86
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,399
Chen Mengwen.

87
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,079
Meng Haitang, Bai Zhenzhu,

88
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,519
stop it.

89
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,439
I'm not like you.

90
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,439
You can stop today,

91
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,759
but what about tomorrow?

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,000
What about next year?

93
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,240
They will still force me to marry someone.

94
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,879
The plight of our women in the countryside

95
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,600
can't be solved by you reading a few lines of poetry

96
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,519
and talking about your ideals.

97
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,759
My mother is right.

98
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,439
It's useless for girls to study.

99
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,240
It's just a waste of time and money.

100
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,319
Our fate is just marriage sooner or later.

101
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
When you marry someone,

102
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,319
the more you know,

103
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,959
the more they will dislike you.

104
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,839
Look at our place,

105
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,399
in a dozen villages,

106
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,920
how many girls are literate?

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,160
I can't be a teacher in my life.

108
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,380
Even if I read Phoenix Seeks Mate 10,000 times,

109
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,879
the black chicken is still a black chicken.

110
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,439
It can't become a phoenix.

111
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,319
No, Chen Mengwen.

112
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,079
Get out of the way.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Raise the sedan chair.

114
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,680
Raise the sedan chair.

115
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,000
Get out of the way.

116
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,000
Hurry up.

117
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,240
Slow down.

118
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,199
About Chen Mengwen,

119
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,160
I have an idea.

120
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,639
I want to run a women's school.

121
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,439
Why do you think so?

122
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,120
When I was in Hangzhou,

123
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,199
this happened to me.

124
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,120
There was also a female student in Haiyu Class.

125
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,160
A woman

126
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,839
can not only give birth to children,

127
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
she can also study

128
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
and even become a great general.

129
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,920
If Wang Yueqing studies well with two brothers

130
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,879
in the Hanguang Squadron,

131
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,120
Zhou Chaojun,

132
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,519
maybe one day

133
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,919
she can lead an army to fight,

134
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,200
even defeat you.

135
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,000
Come back home.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,799
Why study?

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Girls don't need to study,

138
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,039
just grow up and get married.

139
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,120
Come back with me.

140
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,879
Come back home.

141
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
Because her family thought

142
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,000
she was a girl,

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
and she did not have to go to school,

144
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,420
so they stopped her classes.

145
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,840
I met this situation in Hangzhou before.

146
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,799
It can be seen that women can not study

147
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,759
is a bad habit in the entire Chinese tradition.

148
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,320
So

149
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,919
do you want to start a war against this bad habit?

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
Not really.

151
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,919
I just think that one woman

152
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,559
can influence three generations.

153
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,600
The inspiration of the people

154
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,800
should start with women's studies.

155
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,320
So

156
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,440
I'll discuss with my father tomorrow

157
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,360
to see if I can take running a women's school

158
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,960
as a social practice of a teacher's class.

159
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,380
To see if it can that be counted for credit?

160
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,639
How about calling it Haiyu Women's School?

161
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,320
Do you want me and Nianqiao to be the teachers?

162
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,360
We used to be top students.

163
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,000
Right.

164
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,120
Of course.

165
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,639
It's just that

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,679
I might not be able to pay your salary.

167
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
People here are not so well off.

168
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,720
So I think their tuition,

169
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,900
as well as miscellaneous fees,

170
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,590
and all fees…

171
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,790
No fee.

172
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,039
Except for Li's salary,

173
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,720
you can use the rest of my salary

174
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,000
to run your school.

175
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,600
Count me in.

176
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,639
And me.

177
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,720
I still have some living expenses.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,879
And mine.

179
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,120
Except for my marriage money,

180
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,480
the rest is all for you.

181
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,759
I think Haitang was right just now.

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,919
Now it seems that

183
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,360
Yunnan not only needs to build an airport,

184
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,279
but more importantly,

185
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,440
as Haitang said, we need to set up schools,

186
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,840
especially an enlightenment school, women‘s school,

187
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,200
and literacy classes.

188
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,080
In that case,

189
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,960
we will lack more manpower and money.

190
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,200
I'll go home

191
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,620
and discuss with my father about it.

192
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,600
Fuhua, Yunnan

193
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,279
and your Aviation School,

194
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,600
let's do it together.

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,639
- Great.
- Okay.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,639
Dad,

197
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,679
time to eat.

198
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,080
You're here.

199
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,919
Come here, have a look.

200
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,190
The blueprint for this wind tunnel lab

201
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,919
is almost finished.

202
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,039
Really?

203
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,799
That's great.

204
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,600
The wind tunnel we built in Nanchang

205
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,799
was much bigger than the one at Caltech.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Unfortunately, it was bombed by the Japanese.

207
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,620
We haven't had time to use it yet.

208
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,679
This time, let's build a small one.

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This one is only one third of that in Nanchang.

210
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,279
But let's use it first.

211
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,639
As long as we can use it

212
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,240
to test the drag and lift of our fighters.

213
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,279
Now we have the plan.

214
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,399
About the money,

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Captain and I will talk with Minister

216
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,440
to let Aviation Council give us the money.

217
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,200
Great, that's up to you.

218
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,600
Right,

219
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,840
come here.

220
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,279
Didn't you ask me

221
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,000
to overhaul the Xishan again?

222
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,960
I overhauled it this time, look.

223
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,759
I took off the bomb hanger,

224
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
the fairing,

225
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,519
and the landing,

226
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,200
the lighting was also taken off.

227
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,360
I also changed an engine for you.

228
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,759
Engine.

229
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,639
Look.

230
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,960
Of course,

231
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,559
I can't say I replaced it,

232
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,480
I just changed it a bit.

233
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,039
Normally,

234
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,759
the maximum horsepower of this engine is only 745,

235
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,080
but now I've raised it to 1030.

236
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,000
Guess how much speed it can reach

237
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,720
after my modification?

238
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,039
The speed of the Xishan was 420 km/h,

239
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,200
now is it 480 km/h?

240
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,279
No.

241
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Not more than 500.

242
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,240
540.

243
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,919
540.

244
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,240
Father, you're amazing.

245
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,600
It could have been faster,

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,679
if I had taken off the auxiliary fuel tank.

247
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,799
But I put it back on.

248
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,159
What happened last time

249
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,919
can't happen again.

250
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,320
It can't happen again.

251
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,200
Father,

252
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,440
afterwards, the captain repeatedly calculated

253
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,480
that the last accident

254
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,879
should not be due to

255
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,540
the removal of the auxiliary fuel tank.

256
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,000
I've been thinking about it, too.

257
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,039
Even if the sub-tank is removed,

258
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,960
that stall time can not be so short.

259
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,399
It was eight minutes shorter

260
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,399
than I had calculated.

261
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,840
I just can't figure this out.

262
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,559
Xishan should have been hit in the engine line,

263
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,279
resulting in a rapid loss of fuel,

264
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,600
which is why…

265
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,399
Who will fly Xishan this time?

266
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
It should be the captain.

267
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
The Xishan was reborn from the ground up.

268
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,120
Tell the pilot

269
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:34,440
to use high alkane fuel as much as possible,

270
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,240
otherwise it will easily explode.

271
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,360
Father,

272
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,120
what will happen

273
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,399
if the alkane value of the fuel is not enough?

274
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,240
The time in the air will be shortened,

275
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,200
and then there will be an explosion as I said.

276
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,360
But in order to prevent this explosion,

277
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,200
I added alkyl lead anti-explosion agent in it.

278
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,720
Why do you ask this?

279
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,470
Nothing,

280
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,399
I suddenly thought of it,

281
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,200
and asked casually.

282
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,399
Dad,

283
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,279
why didn't you tell the captain yourself?

284
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,639
Let's eat. I'll wash my hands.

285
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,680
The designation of the Hanguang Squadron was revoked.

286
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,559
I fought for it,

287
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,159
it was very difficult.

288
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
But Hanguang,

289
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,879
I got it back for all of you.

290
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,759
What is the meaning of Hanguang?

291
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,960
Hanguang stands for the named sword,

292
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,840
protecting the country and the people with our edge.

293
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,679
Great.

294
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,399
Now I announce that

295
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,799
the designation of Hanguang Squadron will remain.

296
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,440
Captain Zhang Qi.

297
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,519
Yes, sir.

298
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,399
Vice Captain Zeng Nianqiao.

299
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,480
Yes, sir.

300
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,759
Combat Officer Chen Ran.

301
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:04,840
Yes, sir.

302
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,519
Zhang Qi,

303
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,440
you and your soldiers

304
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,360
cannot live up to the name of Hanguang.

305
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,919
Protect the country and the people with our edge.

306
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,960
Protect the country and the people with our edge.

307
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,559
Protect the country and the people with our edge.

308
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,840
According to the organization's instructions,

309
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,279
our task at this stage now

310
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,559
is to do our best

311
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,919
to maintain the anti-Japanese united front

312
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,480
at this time of change.

313
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,799
Continue to assist the Nationalist Air Force

314
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,690
in the fight against the Japanese.

315
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,759
At the same time, we must be alert to

316
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,740
the anti-communist acts of Chinese Nationalist Party,

317
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,570
and surrenderism.

318
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,279
My code name is still Chun Jun,

319
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,279
meaning pure heart,

320
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
and great strength.

321
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,279
Comrade Zhang Qi,

322
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,759
from now on,

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
your code name is Zhan Lu.

324
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Do you know the meaning of Zhan Lu?

325
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,519
Zhan Lu's sword is the sharpest in the world.

326
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,279
If the National Government

327
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,200
is committed to serving the country and the people,

328
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,799
the sword will be at its side to help it.

329
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,359
If it betrays our trust,

330
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,400
the sword will fly away to take its head,

331
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,200
and return to justice.

332
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,799
Tower,

333
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,440
019's throttle lever is normal,

334
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,799
steering pod is normal,

335
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,640
brake is normal,

336
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,640
landing gear is normal.

337
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,960
019 is allowed to drive.

338
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,759
Finished?

339
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,200
It's done.

340
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,960
Stayed up all night again.

341
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,519
Still so disobedient.

342
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:34,839
Lanshan,

343
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,079
when I was writing in Beiping,

344
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,680
every night

345
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,000
you would make a bowl of sesame dumplings

346
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,119
with lotus root powder,

347
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,599
some cinnamon,

348
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,799
and some brown sugar.

349
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,759
Yes.

350
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,799
Water-ground dumplings,

351
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,480
from our hometown.

352
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,039
Later, when we go back to Beiping…

353
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,759
Haitang,

354
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,690
my father's class

355
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,880
was changed to Luofeng Mountain.

356
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,160
We have to go early to get a seat,

357
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,559
or we won't be able to get one if we're late.

358
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,519
Girls,

359
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:31,759
girls,

360
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,519
do you bring your alarm bags?

361
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,839
Yes.

362
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,000
Your lunch.

363
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,359
Your class schedule has been so strange,

364
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,440
to 10 o 'clock in the morning,

365
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,810
and from three to six in the afternoon.

366
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,160
You can't eat in the cafeteria during this long break.

367
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,990
And it's so expensive to buy food outside.

368
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,720
Aunt Meng,

369
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,000
we are under air raids recently.

370
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,319
Recently the air raids are before 11 o'clock.

371
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,160
Air raids.

372
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,000
Living in Kunming for years,

373
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,359
I'm used to the alarms.

374
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:55,800
Well.

375
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,990
I'm not afraid of anything else,

376
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,319
but I'm afraid you'll get hungry.

377
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,319
Put it away.

378
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,160
Okay, we'll leave.

379
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,200
Be careful.

380
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,480
Students,

381
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,580
today we're going to talk about

382
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,930
the history of comparative warfare.

383
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,400
Let's talk about England first.

384
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,839
We all know that

385
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,119
the appeasementist Chamberlain stepped down,

386
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,880
and the warlike Churchill came to power.

387
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:24,880
So here,

388
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,759
I write about a speech

389
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,640
Churchill gave in the House of Commons,

390
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,039
and there are a few key phrases in it

391
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,359
that I need to repeat to you.

392
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,839
Churchill said,

393
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,759
if you ask me what the present policy is,

394
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,000
I will say, our policy is

395
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,759
to use all our power and strength,

396
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,240
on the sea, on the land and in the air,

397
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,799
to fight a war against a vicious tyranny that

398
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:06,680
has never been seen in the history of evil and misery.

399
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,960
If you ask what our purpose is,

400
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,279
then I can answer in one word.

401
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,039
Victory.

402
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,300
The most important task for you two

403
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,079
is to protect Mr. Ling.

404
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,720
- Okay.
- Okay.

405
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,119
Victory.

406
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,480
At all costs to get the victory.

407
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,160
Enemy planes have entered Yunnan.

408
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,319
Hanguang Squadron is assembled,

409
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,550
waiting for the order to drive.

410
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,650
Hanguang Squadron, wait for the order.

411
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,359
Airfield anti-aircraft guns ready.

412
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,680
Enemy planes are entering Kunming.

413
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,960
There are nine 96 land attackers,

414
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,720
escorted by Zeroes.

415
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,079
Hanguang Squadron requests to take off.

416
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,880
Repeat, request to take off.

417
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,519
Hanguang Squadron, no take-off.

418
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,200
Hanguang Squadron, no take-off.

419
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,950
Conceal the aircraft, evacuate the personnel.

420
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,599
Again.

421
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,319
Hanguang Squadron evacuate.

422
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,720
Conceal the aircraft, no take-off.

423
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,640
It's an order.

424
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,839
Do you know that

425
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,440
the Japanese are sending new type of fighters,

426
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
the 96 Land Attack 22,

427
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,530
with a large blister type machine gun tower,

428
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,720
which are much more powerful

429
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,319
than the previous Type 1-1.

430
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,920
Your five Hawk IIIs will be shot up in the sky.

431
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,400
Minster,

432
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,720
avoiding war like this

433
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,640
will only increase the enemy's arrogance,

434
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,990
and destroy our army's prestige.

435
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:07,960
If don't avoid the war,

436
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,360
how can you fight with such a disparity of power?

437
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,279
Since the war of Kunlun Pass on the southern front,

438
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,440
the Soviet volunteers withdrew,

439
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,039
we have less than 100 planes left,

440
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,839
how can we fight?

441
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,480
Hanguang Squadron only has five fighters,

442
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,359
which are the strongest fighting force over Kunming.

443
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,480
The enemy's 2-2 tail gun has a blind spot.

444
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,400
If we enter from the tail at negative altitude,

445
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,359
we still have chances.

446
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,440
Have chance.

447
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,079
The enemy still has six Zeros escorting them.

448
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,200
Were there Zeroes in the Bishan Air Battle?

449
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,079
In the battle of Bishan,

450
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,440
the enemy shot down 24 of our planes

451
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,240
in five minutes,

452
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,359
10 pilots were killed,

453
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,799
and nine were wounded.

454
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,720
The war was horrible.

455
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,160
Older fighters can't have both range and speed.

456
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,799
But the enemy's Zero could do both.

457
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,400
It was unimaginable.

458
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,319
As the Minster of the aviation school,

459
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,000
I'd like to stress again.

460
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,559
Hanguang Squadron

461
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,000
must strictly follow the order.

462
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,340
Hanguang Squadron

463
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,890
is the strongest combat force over Yunnan.

464
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,519
You must obey the orders of the Aviation Council

465
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
and the Aviation School.

466
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,640
Your priority is to protect the aircraft

467
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
and preserve strength.

468
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,359
The disparity between the enemy and us is too great.

469
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,440
To fight in the air is like

470
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,160
hitting a stone with an egg.

471
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,519
All you have to learn is one word,

472
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:43,839
endure.

473
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,960
The war is already heating up.

474
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,240
If we keep holding back,

475
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,720
we'll delay the chance to win the war.

476
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,240
Minster,

477
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,119
please make a statement to Central Aviation Council.

478
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,100
For the past six months,

479
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,930
Japanese planes have been attacking Yunnan.

480
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,640
After our victory in April,

481
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,000
we've been protecting our planes

482
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,070
and preserving our strength.

483
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,880
The enemy has become more and more aggressive,

484
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,270
resulting in damage to the country

485
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,270
and the death of the people.

486
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,440
Yunnan-Burma, Yunnan-Vietnam

487
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,280
traffic lines have been paralyzed repeatedly.

488
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,200
Minster,

489
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,160
if it goes on like this,

490
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,319
we will certainly lose Yunnan.

491
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,119
I think

492
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,720
we should have the courage to die

493
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,079
and not to compromise,

494
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,280
so that the enemy will not dare to

495
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,990
covet our southwest transportation fortress.

496
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,130
We shouldn't take it any longer.

497
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,279
In the era of Wu Zetian,

498
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,559
the prime minister Lou Shide

499
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,680
asked his younger brother

500
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,599
to be the governor of Dai Prefecture

501
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,000
with extreme tolerance.

502
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,759
To be spit on the face,

503
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,480
but accept it with a smile,

504
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,160
and wait for the spit to dry up itself.

505
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,780
Wait for the spit to dry up itself.

506
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,720
This Lou Shide is very pedantic.

507
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,000
But this pedantic man is a wise minister.

508
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,319
When he was the head of the Heyuan Army,

509
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,200
to fight with Tubo, and won all the time.

510
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,119
What you have to practice is tolerance.

511
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,599
But what I said

512
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,000
is not personal honor or disgrace,

513
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,480
but about the war in the southwest.

514
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,079
Sir.

515
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,160
Come in.

516
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,759
Minster,

517
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,480
this is the list of losses of today's air raid.

518
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,440
Take a look.

519
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,799
The casualties and losses are heavy.

520
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,920
This word is pronounced as I.

521
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,799
You and I.

522
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He and I.

523
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,920
We.

524
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,359
To understand the modern character I,

525
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,079
we have to go back to

526
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,279
its oracle bone age.

527
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:39,680
This character is

528
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,599
a pictograph of the character I.

529
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,119
Its left side resembles

530
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:47,920
a rake with teeth at the blade.

531
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,319
Its right side

532
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,799
looks like a hand-held handle.

533
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,359
The whole script

534
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,279
adds up to a pictograph of a weapon.

535
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,400
Students,

536
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,000
take a look,

537
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,160
Does this pictogram

538
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,359
look like the rake held by Zhu Bajie

539
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,799
in the Journey to the West?

540
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Yes.

541
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,119
So

542
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,599
the original meaning of the Chinese character I

543
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,759
is a hand-held weapon.

544
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,960
It tells us to take up weapons

545
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,839
to protect ourselves.

546
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,880
This is the meaning of the character I.

547
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,440
Do you understand?

548
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,799
Yes.

549
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,160
Okay,

550
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,880
let's take a look at another word.

551
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,359
It is also a pictogram.

552
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,440
Bing Bing.

553
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
It's like a circle.

554
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,079
Why are you here?

555
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,200
It is much like what people see

556
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,150
when they indicate the sun.

557
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,640
This word is sun.

558
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,839
You're here to pick up Ms. Meng, right?

559
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,720
I'm here to pick up Haitang.

560
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:52,839
But,

561
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,400
there's something I want to ask you.

562
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,559
What is it?

563
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,599
Sit down.

564
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,359
I want to ask you about Hong'en.

565
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,839
For these two years,

566
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,519
I think he's changed.

567
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,519
I went to see him a few times,

568
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,440
but he always avoided me.

569
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,319
You also think

570
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,000
he's different from before.

571
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,559
Zhenzhu,

572
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,960
since I met you,

573
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,000
you two have been inseparable.

574
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,960
Why have you stopped sticking to him lately?

575
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,440
I always thought that

576
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,240
Hong'en is an aspiring young man

577
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:53,400
with a deep ambition to serve the country,

578
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,599
a hero who fights with his pen,

579
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,960
and a proud person who is not afraid of power.

580
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,599
But now it seems that

581
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,319
this is just what I want him to be.

582
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,279
What happened?

583
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,799
Nothing.

584
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,359
How are you doing recently?

585
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,319
I heard from my dad that

586
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,599
because of the war in Wujiaba,

587
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,200
you can barely fly the planes.

588
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:24,920
Yes.

589
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,000
[Haiyu Women's School]

590
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,279
The Japanese are dropping bombs all the time,

591
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,759
but we're still thinking about

592
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:43,960
whether to fight or not.

593
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,240
We must fight.

594
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:01,240
If Hong'en had your ambition,

595
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,480
his road would not be narrower and narrower.

596
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,000
Bing Bing,

597
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,559
I still remember when I met him,

598
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,759
he was also a young man

599
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,000
with ambition and courage.

600
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,839
Okay,

601
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,640
that's it for today's class.

602
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,799
Remember to go back and write the words

603
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,519
I am Chinese ten times.

604
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,319
Yes.

605
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,680
OK, class is over.

606
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,680
Goodbye, teacher.

607
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,880
Remember to write them down when you go back.

608
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,640
Great.

609
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,719
Zhang Qi.

610
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,199
Zhang Qi.

611
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,599
Why are you here?

612
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,960
Aren't you preparing for the war lately?

613
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,800
I came to see you.

614
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,079
I just heard you talk about the character I.

615
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,119
How is it?

616
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,400
Very good.

617
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,440
Let's go for a walk.

618
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,119
We were bombed two days ago,

619
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,840
and we suffered heavy losses.

620
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,100
The Japanese dropped incendiary bombs,

621
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,199
which could burn for 10 to 15 minutes at a time.

622
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,599
The burning temperature

623
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:03,770
can reach 3,000 degrees Celsius.

624
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,039
So there's no way to put out the fire.

625
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,559
Once a house catches fire,

626
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,519
half of the street will suffer.

627
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,800
Can't you take off to stop them?

628
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,599
We're still avoiding the war.

629
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,119
They don't allow us to fly.

630
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,719
Haitang,

631
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,480
as a soldier,

632
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,760
I see Kunming burned to the ground,

633
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,480
but I couldn't fight with the enemy.

634
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,039
Chongqing government

635
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,730
doesn't want to hit the stone with an egg.

636
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,159
Aviation Council

637
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,880
has repeatedly stressed

638
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,000
how much it costs to buy back a fighter plane,

639
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:50,639
and how much it costs to train a pilot.

640
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,800
On the contrary,

641
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,119
the lives of the people

642
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,719
are worthless in their eyes.

643
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,280
In order to retain their so-called strength,

644
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,920
they cowered in a corner,

645
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,960
and made Kunming a defenseless city.

646
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,400
Haitang,

647
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,000
as a soldier,

648
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,840
I feel bad.

649
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,840
It's not your fault.

650
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,159
Guess

651
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,480
why I thought of teaching the word I.

652
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,719
Let me show you something.

653
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,480
This is a copy printed by the students of the club.

654
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,760
On Protracted War,

655
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:36,960
Mao Zedong.

656
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,039
Yes.

657
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,559
All the students of Fuhua read this?

658
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,239
Regardless of the faction,

659
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,159
everyone reads it.

660
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,559
There's a lot of bickering

661
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,920
over the Democracy Wall.

662
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,159
But this is the one,

663
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,000
everyone is convinced.

664
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:50,920
Look at this paragraph,

665
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,639
the main reason

666
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,810
why the Japanese dare to bully us

667
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,710
is because of the disorganization of the Chinese.

668
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,360
And here.

669
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,440
If we mobilize the power of the Chinese people,

670
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,480
we will create a sea

671
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,199
that will be able to trap the enemy,

672
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,159
create a remedy for the defects of weapons,

673
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,500
and create a prerequisite

674
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,100
for overcoming all the difficulties of war.

675
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,280
As we discussed,

676
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,760
every Chinese,

677
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,480
whether armed or not,

678
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,480
military or civilian,

679
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,880
is a soldier in the face of national disaster.

680
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,039
So,

681
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,119
you're trying to get the girls

682
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,880
to understand that

683
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,360
we have to use weapons to protect ourselves.

684
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,239
If everyone has such an awareness,

685
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,360
if there is only one city left in China,

686
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,719
we will never surrender.

687
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,920
Even if the Japanese have warplanes,

688
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,960
tanks and bombs,

689
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,840
we are not afraid of them.

690
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,159
My Haitang's aura

691
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,360
is much tougher than those officials.

692
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,079
Mr. Mao's articles are so powerful.

693
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,960
He said that

694
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,430
the War of Resistance against Japan

695
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,630
should go through three stages:

696
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,559
strategic defense,

697
00:37:58,559 --> 00:37:59,340
strategic stalemate

698
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,940
and strategic counteroffensive.

699
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,519
Mr. Mao said that

700
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,199
the second stage

701
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,360
is the most difficult period,

702
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,960
but it is also the key to everything.

703
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,760
China can become an independent country

704
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,639
or become a colony

705
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,360
depends on the results

706
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,079
of the efforts of the whole nation at this stage.

707
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,360
So, Zhang Qi,

708
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,800
we are fighting a protracted war,

709
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,559
not a one-off war.

710
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,639
I'm a girl,

711
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,960
but I'm confident.

712
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,679
You've grown up.

713
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,520
There is another piece of good news to tell you.

714
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,970
The second draft of "Yin Dynasty Calendar"

715
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,620
is finished.

716
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,200
The manuscript was lost for only seven months.

717
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,079
So fast.

718
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,119
Ms. Kang helped Uncle Ling

719
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:41,360
write it together.

720
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,280
And if it was just a rewrite,

721
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,490
it would only take four months.

722
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,280
But this time

723
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,679
they added new research,

724
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:47,810
and it only took seven months.

725
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,719
Uncle Ling said that

726
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,039
the publication of this book,

727
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,510
can confront Japan's cut down of the Chinese history.

728
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,440
Mr. Ling is also a fighter.

729
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,199
Uncle Ling said that

730
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,990
we can't avoid confrontation with the jackal,

731
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,519
and can't be afraid.

732
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,119
We should face its eyes,

733
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,960
and beat its nose.

734
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,239
So, Zhang Qi,

735
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,679
Kunming can't be the defenseless city

736
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:17,559
you just mentioned.

737
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,800
We should make the enemy fearful,

738
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,559
and make them afraid.

739
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,599
Is there other way

740
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,559
to make them afraid to offend us?

741
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,000
Other ways.

742
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,800
The sunset glow dies silently in purple.

743
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,800
Darkness kills the last light.

744
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,239
When everything falls to

745
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,960
the brutality and the power,

746
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,840
it's the ancient wall of endurance

747
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,880
that stands on the wilderness.

748
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,199
During the war,

749
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,320
the Japanese bombed Kunming and its vicinity

750
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,039
for a total of 142 times.

751
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,039
The Japanese chose to bomb Kunming

752
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,800
because it has

753
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,750
two important international lines of communication,

754
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,079
and is a strategic base for transporting war supplies,

755
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,280
medical supplies and war rations.

756
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Therefore, during the War of Resistance against Japan,

757
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,079
kunming was the most heavily bombed capital city

758
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,800
besides Chongqing.

759
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,320
Now our planes are not allowed to fly,

760
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,000
it's more important to find ways

761
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,519
to strengthen the static defense of the air.

762
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,599
There's a kind of deep blast

763
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,320
laid by floating bombs,

764
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,639
maybe we can try it.

765
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,119
But, in order to create deep blast,

766
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,599
multiple planes need to be

767
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
in the air at the same time

768
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,930
to release the floating bombs.

769
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,840
On the day of 811 air war in Chongqing,

770
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,800
the Fourth Brigade

771
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:20,519
flight six planes at the same time to release bombs.

772
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,159
In addition,

773
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:23,280
there were 45 Hawk IIIs,

774
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,840
I-15 and I-16 Fighter

775
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,639
attacking at the same time.

776
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,719
In this way,

777
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,400
we dispatched 51 planes

778
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,320
against 87 enemy planes,

779
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,159
then we won.

780
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,320
But now we're not allowed

781
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,480
to fly against the enemy.

782
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,320
It's hard to carry out this plan.

783
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,000
I heard that the floating bombs

784
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,159
were only used twice over Chongqing,

785
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,559
and were banned,

786
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,760
because they were too dangerous for pilots.

787
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,599
Do you know that

788
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,639
the 14th Air Squadron

789
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,239
is working on weather balloons?

790
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:51,920
You mean

791
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,159
make a variant of the floating bomb?

792
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,039
That's right.

793
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,440
Since we're not allowed to fly,

794
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,000
then let's use hydrogen balloons

795
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,320
to bring the bombs up.

796
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,480
As long as we know the location and time

797
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,079
of enemy planes entering Yunnan,

798
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,390
taking into account

799
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,710
the wind direction and other factors,

800
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:09,970
then we can set up floating bombs in advance.

801
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:13,039
Southwest wind prevails in Kunming all the year round,

802
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,599
which is very favorable for us.

803
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,239
So now we have to

804
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,519
pay attention to two problems.

805
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,280
First,

806
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,500
the flying altitude and speed

807
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,239
of the enemy aircraft and the hydrogen balloon,

808
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,960
as well as the factors affected.

809
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:25,920
Second,

810
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:28,599
how deep the bomb area is?

811
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,840
Will the enemy aircraft really hit it or not?

812
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,039
Therefore,

813
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,280
we need a decoy.

814
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,440
After several fights, I found that

815
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,360
the Japanese enemy has a chronic problem.

816
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,390
They don't pay attention to the formation.

817
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,960
Once they see our fighter planes,

818
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,280
they will rush up.

819
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,000
I think we can make use of this.

820
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:48,880
That's right.

821
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,320
They're desperate to win.

822
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,039
Their tactics look fierce,

823
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:54,000
but in fact, they lack coordination.

824
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:56,000
So here's the plan.

825
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,679
Let's send a routine fighter into the air.

826
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,159
Its only task is

827
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,039
to lure the enemy into our bomb zone.

828
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,760
That's a good plan.

829
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,119
They wouldn't let us

830
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,199
take off to meet the enemy.

831
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,880
Can't we just escape without firing?

832
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,199
I have a question.

833
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,400
Say it.

834
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,400
Where can we get so many hydrogen balloons?

835
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:27,700
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

836
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:35,600
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

837
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:43,050
♫ Shed tears to our sweet love ♫

838
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:51,530
♫ The date of return is yet to come ♫

839
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,700
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

840
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,530
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

841
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:06,530
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

842
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:13,780
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

843
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:21,580
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

844
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,730
