00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,159
I picked it up in Anyi.

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,040
It belongs to you.

8
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,680
Just keep it.

9
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,959
It looks good that way.

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,719
I bet you didn't bring your wind bells from Peiping.

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,080
I'll make you a new one.

There you are.

Where is he?

22
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,680
He's inside Mr. Ling's room.

23
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,680
Alright. Don't mind me.

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,639
I'll go check on them.

Just name it.

Professor Jin was devoted
to protecting the oracle bone.

31
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,000
He made a thorough plan at the cost of his life.

32
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,360
You ought to bring it to Kunming in one piece.

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,039
Zhang Qi.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,719
To be honest with you,

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,000
I've lost the bone

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
by the time I left Hangzhou.

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,199
What?

38
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,680
It's my fault.

39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,719
Professor Jin protected it

40
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,039
at the cost of his life.

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,319
I failed to secure it.

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,199
I've failed him.

00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,560
Well.

44
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,159

45
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,360

00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,120
Professor Jin often speaks of

53

one character of the pigeons.

I put that oracle bone

69

inside a wooden box.

70
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,199
The box is hidden

71
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,800
inside a hole on the wall of the Temple of Guan Yu.

72

It was there. I checked it!

73

But when I left Hangzhou,

74
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,720
the wooden box was empty.

75
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,639

Exactly.

that the Calendar of Yi is so hard to deal with.

95

Ling has only finished a few dozen pages.

96
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,399
It would take a long time.

97
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,040
Just you wait. Two years at least.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,720
Actually,

99

On June 16th last year,

102

Mr. Jin entrusted me

103

with the oracle bone in Beiping.

104
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Because of the battle,

105
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,680
I lost oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

106
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,000
in Hangzhou by accident.

107
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,720
Mr. Jin led me to this path.

108
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,600
It was his will

109
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,879
and the party's task for me to protect it.

110
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,439
Yet, I failed it.

111
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,000
I will report to our superior about this incident.

112
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,199
I'm partly at fault.

113
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,920
It's not your fault.

114
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,079

00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,920
Mr. Jin asked for me.

118
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,920
He asked me to get to his home

119
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,040
and gave me another wooden box

120
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,160
in order to divert the enemy away

121
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,439
and protect the real escort.

122

That's my mission.

130
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,600
However, I've asked Mr. Ling.

131
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,080
He still has the rubbings.

132
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,120
He could still work on

133

Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

134
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,960

It's me, Qi.

00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:58,919
you're looking for.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,600
What?

141
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,039
I brought the turtle shell

from Hangzhou to here.

143
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,639
Tell me.

144
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,519
Is this something remarkable?

145
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,440
Just like what my elder brother did.

146
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,000
Where is it?

147
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,000
Lead the way.

148
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,159

That's it.

Mr. Jin guarded it with his life.

The Mr. Jin you mentioned

154

is just like Mr. Fu

155
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,919
I met on the way here.

156
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,080
They're so similar.

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,759
Stubborn yet heartwarming.

158
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,799
Only when times are extreme

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,360
will one's integrity be manifested.

160
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,679
What?

161
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,519
In simple words, you showed your integrity

162
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,200
at such a critical moment.

163
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,159
So,

164
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,879
did I do something remarkable?

165
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,279
Remarkable?

166
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,320
But it should be Mr. Ling

167
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,480
who took it out.

168
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,120
You almost got him killed.

169
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,679
That would be a disaster.

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,639
You should not steal.

171
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,799
Or I'll teach you

172

an unforgettable lesson.

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,559
Okay, Qi.

174
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,039
I get it.

175
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,519
I guess

176
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,759
hiding this oracle bone

177
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,120
isn't Mr. Jin's only purpose.

178
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,320
He painted a false picture

179
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,399
to everyone going after this.

180
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,159
How about this?

181
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,639
I'll secure this bone

182
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,200
from now on.

183
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,840
Alright.

184
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,080
Great.

185
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:25,960
Zhenzhu?

186
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,279
Zhenzhu!

187
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,320
Zhenzhu!

188
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,080
It is you!

189
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,960
Over here, take a seat.

190
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,360
Here.

191
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,559
Put down the camera.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,720
Why?

193
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,159
Shouldn't you be here last November?

194
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,200
I kept looking for you

195
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,120
the moment I got here.

196
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,039
Well.

197
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,799
I got here once.

198
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,480
Soon after that, I headed to Changsha,

199
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,279
then to Chongqing.

200
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,639
At last,

201
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,519
I visited the Burma Road

202
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,080
and took many pictures of that road.

203
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,480
It was magnificent.

204
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,480
The construction will be completed this month.

205
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,360
Wait.

206
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,320
What did you say?

207
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,799
You went to Changsha?

208
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,200
What were you doing there?

209
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,399
It's a war zone, Central China.

210
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,639
What if something happens?

211
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,399
What could you do?

212
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,919
You know me well.

213
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,080
I just couldn't sit still.

214
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,759
I'm willing to look around.

215
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,879
The battle there

216
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,120
makes it more attractive.

217
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm deeply impressed

218
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,679
by my journey to Changsha.

219
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,840
Hongen, do you know

220
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,240
that before Fuhua University moves here,

221
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,559
the students lived in temporary housing

222
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,840
at the foot of Yuelu Mountain.

223
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,200
And Yanxi University,

224
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,240
there were thousands of students

225
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,039
relocated to Kunming.

226
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,960
You have no idea what it's like.

227
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,879
Every day in the morning,

228
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,720
you can hear students

229
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
reading in the Bible College.

230
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,639
Even as someone who used to hate studying,

231
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,799
I'm deeply touched.

232
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,519
That's why

233
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,320
I've decided to study at the university.

234
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:52,759
Seriously?

235
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,679
Are you going to university?

236
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,480
Xiao Hongen! Don't you give me that look.

237
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,600
Just wait and see.

238
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,320
Fine.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
[Normal College]

240
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,720
Who's that?

241
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,799
He'd have driven the car inside the classroom
if he could.

242
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,240
What does he want?

243
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,559
He must come to the wrong place.

244
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,799
Do you know

245
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,720
where is the teacher training course held?

246
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,519
Excuse me.

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,600
Does anyone of you see my lady?

248
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,960
Your lady?

249
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:55,759
Who's that?

250
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,720
My lady,

251
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,840
daughter of Supervisor Bai!

252
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
Isn't that little Devil from Baifei's family?

253
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,200
How dare you?

254
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,919
Why do you bring them here?

255
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,639
I heard laughter as I came in.

256
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,639
Who's talking about

257
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,200
little Devil from Baifei's family?

258
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,360
Allow me to introduce myself.

259
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,039
I'm the Little Devil you were talking about,

260
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,759
Bai Zhenzhu.

261
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,840
From now on,

262
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,960
we're classmates.

263
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,519
Hey, miss.

264
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Do you remember me?

265
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,039
Miss Zhenzhu!

266
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,320
Aren't you a journalist?

267
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,360
Why are you here in Fuhua?

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
From now on,

269
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,519
you're under my protection.

270
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,279
Who are you?

271
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,519
You must be the teacher.

272
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,799
I'm Supervisor Bai Fei's adjutant.

273
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,399
This is his daughter.

274
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,799
As for those people at the door,

275
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,919
Secretary General Meng promised

276
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,600
to get them enrolled

277
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,879
in this teacher training course.

278
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,759
Please take care of them.

279
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,960
Now that you're not a student here,

280
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,080
please leave the classroom.

281
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,240
What's more,

282
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,360
vehicles are forbidden in the campus.

283
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,639
Please park it outside.

284
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,679
You...

285
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,440
Stop standing!

286
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,679
Didn't you hear what Ms. Kang said?

287
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,000
Take them home now.

288
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,519
Yes.

289
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,240
Hurry.

290
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,879
You may come in.

291
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,000
- Okay.
- Come on.

292
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,600
Class begins.

293
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:41,879
Stand up.

294
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,279
Good morning, teacher.

295
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,919
Sit down, please.

296
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,519
The first class of our normal college

297
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,519
is about your appearance.

298
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,759
You don't have to wear fancy clothes.

299
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,679
But they must be clean.

300
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,279
You don't have to be rich.

301
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,200
Yet you must have integrity.

302
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,080
You are trained to be the future teachers.

303
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,480
What you are will shape your students.

304
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,159
As a teacher,

305
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,360
we're here to bright light and warmth to others.

306
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,120
The most important heritage

307
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,480
of Fuhua Normal College

308
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,639
is our motto,

309
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,679
to spread light.

310
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,759
In our culture,

311
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,240
we precept this world in two ways.

312
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,919
When we open our eyes,

313
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,440
we witness this ever-changing world.

314
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,159
As we close our eyes, introspection begins.

315
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,159
Seek perfection at our advantages

316
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,279
and be modest about our limitations.

317
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,279
Now, class,

318
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:06,000
please close your eyes with me

319
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,079
and reflect on ourselves.

320
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,079
The class is over.

321
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,640
Stands up.

322
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,640
Zhenzhu, aren't you leaving?

323
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,039
That's too much to take in.

324
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,559
I need to take notes.

325
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,160
Let's go.

326
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,319
We're leaving.

327
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:28,519
Goodbye.

328
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
Welcome to Wanbaoquan Tailor Shop,

329
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
we make the best wedding clothes.

330
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,720
Great!

331
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,200
Well, there are more people

332
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,000
coming from the north.

333
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,279
As a result,

334
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,599
we have received more qipao orders recently.

335
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,400
Let's start with the fabric.

336
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Sure.

337
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,559
What do you think of this one?

338
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,920
A bride should dress in red.

339
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
But that's too much red.

340
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,519
Yuanyin prefers plain colors.

341
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,440
I don't like it.

342
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,319
Alright.

343
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,160

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,519
Too many people there.

516
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:06,759
After the ceremony,

517
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,759
I'll find a place for us.

518
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,319
We could move out and live together.

519
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,759
Actually,

520
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,880
I think it would be lively

521
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,920
to live with Qianying and Haitang.

522
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,000
That works as well if you like it.

523
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,640
As long as we're together,

524
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,640
I'll do anything for you.

525
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,519
I know you'd agree.

526
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,039
Look.

527
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,119
The swing faces to the north.

528
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,119
4,000 kilometers from here is Hailun City.

529
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,359
4,000 kilometers!

530
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,880
That's so far away.

531
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,160
But,

532
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,480
that's where Poshan grows up in that remote city.

533
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,119
How I wish to go back and take a look there!

534
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,960
I miss my mom,

535
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,799
my grandma and my grandpa.

536
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
It's been six years the last time I swept their tombs.

537
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,039
Don't know when could we make it back.

538
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,319
We will.

539
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,519
By that time,

540
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,119
I'll go back with you.

541
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,559
Sure.

542
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,519
I must let my mom and grandparents witness that

543
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,200
I'm blessed with such a lovely wife.

544
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,200
I'm sure they'll like you.

545
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,599
In autumn,

546
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,680
I will grow some peonies here.

547
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,079
And some feather finger grasses.

548
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,400
I love it.

549
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,039
Once we have a baby,

550
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,440
I'll grow some black nightshade here.

551
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,920
It's called Yoyo fruit in my hometown.

552
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,960
It has a sweet and sour taste.

553
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,119
I'm sure

554
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,039
little Yuanyin will pick the fruits up.

555
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,200
Little Yuanyi?

556
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,920
What if it's a little Poshan?

557
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,400
What if your father prefers a grandson?

558
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,359
Don't mind him.

559
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,799
It's our baby.

560
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,359
Father.

561
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,240
Where do these books go to?

562
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,160
I've sorted them out.

563
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,079
These two piles go there.

564
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,680
Those should be shelved there.

565
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,839
- Sure.
- Alright.

566
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,759
Come over.

567
00:27:59,119 --> 00:27:59,920
This way.

568
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,759
I've fine-tuned the Hawk III Fighter

569
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,680
that you modified.

570
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,319
Although its flight time is shorter,

571
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,599
it can fly much faster

572
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,759
and climb up quicker now.

573
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:12,960
Take a look.

574
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:14,759
Check it out.

575
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,240
It's ready.

576
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,160
All set.

577
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,440
A new Hawk III is born.

578
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,119
I've removed the drop tank

579
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,720
and modified the oil circuit.

580
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,920
But I must warn you,

581
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:32,799
guys,

582
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,559
we're robbing Peter to pay Paul.

583
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,359
It's far from ideal.

584
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,759
To truly improve its performance,

585
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,240
we need to upgrade the engine inside.

586
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,440
Just deal with it for now.

587
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:45,400
That's right.

588
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,720
The flight time is shorter now.

589
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,279
To compensate for the loss,

590
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,160
I've added something to the fuel.

591
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,160
It brings up the octane value.

592
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,640
Let me ask you.

593
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,480
What is this?

594
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,119
Alkyl lead compounds!

595
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,640
Not bad, you remember it!

596
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,480
You didn't forget the class.

597
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,759
That's right.

598
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,680
What's more,

599
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,920
I've added some manganese compounds

600
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,240
so that it won't explode.

601
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,759
This time the engine knock will be suppressed.

602
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,440
Thank you for helping us out.

603
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,640
The modification this time makes it swifter.

604
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,400
At the same time,

605
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,200
the risk is higher.

606
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,119
Make one mistake...

607
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,160
Sir.

608
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:48,880
I understand.

609
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,599
No, you don't.

610
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,920
It's a double-edged sword.

611
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
To win or to lose.

612
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,480
That's to say,

613
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,240
the driver must be skillful.

614
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,640
That's right.

615
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,519
Only Poshan and I can handle this jet.

616
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,799
Father.

617
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,440
I've never seen you do this before.

618
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,960
You and Captain add up makes us invincible.

619
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,519
I mean it.

620
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,480
Invincible.

621
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,960
Mitsubishi A5M is highly maneuverable.

622
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,640
But it's slow.

623
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,079
That's to say

624
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,559
we must get entangled

625
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,559
and launch a surprise attack from its dead angle.

626
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,319
What's more,

627
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,400
Mitsubishi A5M can't hover for long.

628
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
We should make the best use

629
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,680
of our motility in battles.

630
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:43,640
Exactly,

631
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,039
the Japs' air force

632
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,200
has one deadly weakness.

633
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,240
They have no sense of formation flight.

634
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,200
As long as we coordinate closely,

635
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,119
taking advantage of our gift,

636
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,000
we can conquer them.

637
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,720
The swing tactic,

638
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,319
deputy captain has taught it to you.

639
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,559
This modified Xishan jet is light and fast.

640
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,480
It has greater combat ability.

641
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,680
As a result,

642
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,519
it will be our leader in the swing tactic.

643
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,240
Right now,

644
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,920
we will allocate it to the best pilot here.

645
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,759
Zeng Poshan.

646
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,079
From now on,

647
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,000
Xishan belongs to you.

648
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,720
Formation training starts tomorrow.

649
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,839
Great!

650
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:38,680
Bear it in mind

651
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,240
that Xishan doesn't have a drop tank.

652
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,240
So, the flight time is much shorter.

653
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,720
Do not act rashly.

654
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,200
In one word,

655
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,240
Xishan should fight in a fast way.

656
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,200
Hit and run.

657
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,359
Bear it in mind.

658
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,519
When the limit is reached,

659
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,799
whatever the situation is,

660
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,839
you must return to base.

661
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,880
Or you'll be punished according to the military law.

662
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,559
Yes, sir! I get it!

663
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,920
Repeat my order.

664
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,319
When the limit is reached,

665
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,640
whatever the situation is,

666
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,599
I must return to base.

667
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,240
Good.

668
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,039
Poshan.

669
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,680
Two happy events at the same time.

670
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,160
Announce the other one yourself.

671
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:14,720
Sure!

672
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,200
Guys!

673
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,680
April 3rd will be my wedding day.

674
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,880
Be sure to come by.

675
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,559
- Of course!
- Just you wait!

676
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,200
Be sure to come.

677
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,599
Sure!

678
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,440
Good for you!

679
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,279
It's four days from now.

680
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:25,839
Right!

681
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,920
Be sure to show up.

682
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,039
Not bad, huh?

683
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,000
You should have got married two years ago,

684
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,279
Yet the battle in Kunming

685
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,319
got it delayed for two years.

686
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,480
Ms. Xu must be anxious!

687
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:38,720
Guys,

688
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,240
be sure to give him

689
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,079
an unforgettable ceremony.

690
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,119
Great!

691
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,279
Here, try this dish.

692
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,480
Thanks, father.

693
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,599
Thanks, dad.

694
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
Great.

695
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,119
Dad.

696
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,640
I want to make a toast.

697
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,759
I used to be naughty.

698
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,359
I often made you mad.

699
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,319
I apologize for my wrongdoing.

700
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:02,680
You've grown up.

701
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,240
You're about to get married.

702
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,359
That's the necessary etiquette.

703
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,920
Sure. Go ahead.

704
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,640
Good.

705
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,319
Dad.

706
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:13,880
Great.

707
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,519
I'm entrusted with Xishan officially today.

708
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,279
You'll fly it, too.

709
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,279
Well.

710
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,799
Did Zhang Qi tell you about the caveats?

711
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,559
Yes, he did.

712
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,480
I only have one tip for you.

713
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,279
Be sure to make it back safe.

714
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,640
Yes, dad.

715
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,279
What's more,

716
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,400
I'm getting married tomorrow.

717
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,880
Your two sons are both grown-ups.

718
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,720
My brother, Yuanyin and I

719
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,160
will take care of you together.

720
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:48,920
How time flies!

721
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,680
You've both grown up now.

722
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,799
Nianqiao.

723
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,240
Do you remember

724
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,279
back in Beiping that year,

725
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,519
where you stood under Yiliju Archway.

726
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,079
You were about this tall.

727
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,480
You were so skinny,

728
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,239
just like me when I was a kid.

729
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,320
You kept following me.

730
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,159
I couldn't get rid of you.

731
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,719
I had no choice but to take you with me.

732
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,760
That's how you became my son.

733
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,280
It feels like yesterday.

734
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
Nianqiao.

735
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,360
You need to work harder.

736
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,199
What? Seriously?

737
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:36,760
Think about it.

738
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,440
In terms of the relationship,

739
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,480
you should learn from Poshan.

740
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,800
Look at him.

741
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:46,280
According to the tradition,

742
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,239
if the elder brother is single,

743
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,280
the second son could not get married.

744
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,760
Father,

745
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,639
you are not someone who sticks in the mud.

746
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,960
Don't be bothered.

747
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's not about the tradition.

748
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,599
What I mean is

749
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,599
it's about time to find a spouse.

750
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,679
You really need to learn from Poshan.

751
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,519
Father.

752
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,199
His girlfriend keeps chasing him.

753
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,400
If Nianqiao brings her home one day,

754
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,320
you will be surprised for sure!

755
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,280
Really?

756
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,000
Of course!

757
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,880
A surprise for real?

758
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:21,159
Who is she? A goddess or what?

759
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,360
A surprise, I doubt it.

760
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,039
It's not like that.

761
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,280
That's the only female pilot

762
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,440
in our aviation school.

763
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,159
Female pilot!

764
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,280
Lieutenant Li from Transport Brigade.

765
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,760
She always strides forward with her chin up.

766
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
She doesn't even blink when firing.

767
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,079
Poshan.

768
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:37,679
Is that real?

769
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,320
Yes, it is!

770
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,800
Come on, Poshan. Stop the nonsense.

771
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,079
Is that true?

772
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,679
Well, Lieutenant Li is a colleague of mine.

773
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,440
She's kindhearted.

774
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,920
She invited me to a movie once,

775
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,840
and made me a pair of gloves.

776
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,599
That's all.

777
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,159
Nothing else.

778
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,400
What else do you want?

779
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,480
You foolish boy!

780
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,480
Can't you see what she's doing?

781
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,639
It's a love confession!

782
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,800
Exactly!

783
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,639
That... that is

784
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,599
a love confession?

785
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,480
Of course.

786
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,119
Well...

787
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,719
Mind your attitude!

788
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,039
Is that so?

789
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,920
I didn't think about it at all!

790
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,440
Nianqiao.

791
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,320
You are a better pilot than me.

792
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:13,320
But I must say

793
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,039
you should learn from me about relationships.

794
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,400
Teach him.

795
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,519
It's a yes or no question.

796
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,800
Do you like her or not?

797
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,519
How could you not be aware of it?

798
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,519
Hold on. Stop.

799
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,280
Wait a moment.

800
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,440
Father.

801
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,079
We're gathering here to discuss the details

802
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,079
of his wedding ceremony tomorrow.

803
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,760
Why are you giving me a lecture?

804
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,639
Well.

805
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,199
I don't care about the details.

806
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,519
That's your concern.

807
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,639
I don't care.

808
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,599
I can't wait to see my grandson.

809
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,320
Yuanyin, you're so pretty!

810
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,119
It all thanks to the fabric Poshan chose.

811
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,800
And the tailoring is great, too.

812
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,639
I know Poshan has great taste.

813
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:52,039
He has the best wife, and the best qipao for her.

814
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:55,320
But, why did the tailor use a copper button here?

815
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,239
It's there for a reason!

816
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,519
That copper button

817
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,800
is from Poshan's service uniform.

818
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,920
He promised that his heart would beat

819
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,280
with Ms. Xu Yuanyin at the same pace from now on.

820
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,000
What are you thinking about, Qianying?

821
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,880
Nothing.

822
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,880
It's pretty.

823
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,159
The sorrows of our little girl.

824
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:24,960
What's that?

825
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:25,920
Tell us about it.

826
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,079
I'm thinking, it would be great

827
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,440
if I could marry a hero just like you.

828
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,480
But, I've seen Nianqiao's girlfriend.

829
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,679
I can't marry him now.

830
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:44,800
Come on.

831
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,320
What are you thinking?

832
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,440
Nianqiao never said that he's not single.

833
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,360
That's right.

834
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,000
He didn't.

835
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:57,559
Yuanyin.

836
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,599
I want to be as pretty as you are.

837
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,239
Haitang.

838
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,360
I think this wedding veil looks better on you.

839
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,639
Poshan is so rush.

840
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,960
We could have waited

841
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,960
for Captain Zhang to recover.

842
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,639
You and he,

843
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,519
I and Poshan,

844
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,920
we can hold the ceremony together.

845
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,639
Isn't that great?

846
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,719
He hasn't proposed to me yet.

847
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,199
Do you want to marry him?

848
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,320
Out of question.

849
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,960
She definitely wants to.

850
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,400
It's just...

851
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,639
he's been stuck

852
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,840
with the jet modification.

853
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,400
He has spent most of his time

854
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,719
in the airport or on training.

855
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,639
As for me,

856
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,239
I've got a tight schedule, too.

857
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,559
Recently, Ms. Kang and I

858
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,000
are helping Mr. Ling
to drawing rubbings from the scratch.

859
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,519
And I'm learning the teaching course

860
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,760
so as to hold a girls' school.

861
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,880
And I'm learning oracles from Mr. Ling.

862
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,199
In my girls' school,

863
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:56,719
I'd like to hold a history class.

864
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Great!

865
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:00,960
That's to say,

866
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,880
I can accept it if we don't get married now.

867
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,519
As long as he's determined to stay with me,

868
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,599
and I to him,

869
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,400
that's enough.

870
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,639
When did you make up your mind?

871
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,480
Let me think.

872
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,760
It should be on August 14th.

873
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,280
The clinic was bombed.

874
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,360
So I went to pray under the begonia tree

875
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,119
for him to come back safe.

876
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,880
And he showed up!

877
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,400
I think that was the moment I knew

878
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,199
I was stuck on him.

879
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,679
But I was too young,

880
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,159
and too stubborn to admit it.

881
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,239
I even made a bet with him.

882
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,880
I remembered that

883
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
Ms. Meng went to a fortuneteller.

884
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,159
It said that your future husband

885
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,960
would have begonia flowers on him.

886
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,719
Do you remember?

887
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,920
So, does Zhang Qi has one?

888
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,599
Yes, he does!

889
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:57,180
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

890
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:05,080
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

891
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:12,530

00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:36,010
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

896
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:43,260
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

897
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:51,060
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

898
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:57,210
