00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,910
Uncle Meng.

168
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,670
Sir.

169
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,540
Look over there.

170
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,710
I'm going to find her.

171
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,250
Daddy.

172
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,930
You know that

173
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,100
we should make the decision soon at a critical moment.

174
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,230
You mean

175
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,910
we're now at the critical moment?

176
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,490
Yes.

177
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,950
Actually, you've made up your mind.

178
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,340
What you've done yesterday was right.

179
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,630
Thank you.

180
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,950
Take it easy.

181
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,100
Coming in time is better than coming earlier.

182
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,740
Besides, nothing is more important
than applying medicine for you.

183
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,230
Does it still hurt?

184
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,780
No.

185
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,930
That's fine.

186
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,710
I've arranged the car.

187
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,990
Let's set off.

188
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,910
My dad.

189
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,630
What are you doing? Let me off!

190
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,060
Loose me!

191
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,060
Let me off!

192
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,100
What do you want to do?

193
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,110
I think you've hidden something
that will hinder the flight.

194
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,390
I need to pat you down now.

195
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,750
Qianying!

196
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,770
Nianqiao.

197
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,470
- Are you fine?
- Yes.

198
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,300
Zeng Nianqiao!

199
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,100
How dare you betray us!

200
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,020
Qianying, bring the map away.

201
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,710
Minister!

202
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,250
Don't come close to me!

203
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,670
If so, I'll shoot you!

204
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,740
You know poems.

205
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,820
Your parents haven't taught you how to shoot, right?

206
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,630
Killing others comes naturally to me!

207
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,190
Let's go.

208
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,990
No! It's too dangerous!

209
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,340
Just obey the command.

210
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,500
He's our captain!

211
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,910
What if he meets an accident?

212
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,020
Ran! Shenghong!

213
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,580
- Captain!
- What are you doing?

214
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,230
Ran, calm down.

215
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,500
Zou Shenghong, what do you want to do?

216
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,690
Shenghong, come with me!

217
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,780
Let me go!

218
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,950
Hanguang Squadron?

219
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
Anyone?

220
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,470
Yes.

221
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,390
Where's Adjutant Zheng?

222
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,230
I asked him to capture Zou Shenghong

223
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,540
but why hasn't he come back?

224
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,390
I haven't met him since you came back this afternoon.

225
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,570
Captain.

226
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,670
- See you soon.
- See you.

227
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,930
See you.

228
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,390
Come on.

229
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,910
Captain.

230
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,750
Li Xinye is dead.

231
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,780
Mission continues.

232
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,430
Nianqiao.

233
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,430
- See you later.
- See you.

234
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,430
Let's go.

235
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,430
Miss Meng.

236
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,130
Oh, no.

237
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,990
Mrs. Zhang.

238
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,910
It's great to see you again.

239
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,390
I haven't felicitated you on your marriage.

240
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,060
Can we fly to Peiping safely?

241
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,740
It shouldn't be up to me.

242
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,950
Oh, you're right.

243
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,910
It's up to me.

244
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,500
You're really guided by the current course of events.

245
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,580
Fasten the belt.

246
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,910
Please fasten your belt.

247
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,910
We're going to take off.

248
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,500
Fasten it.

249
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,820
Whether or not we can be safe,

250
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,340
it relies on neither you nor me.

251
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,020
It depends on the pilots.

252
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,540
Control tower, report from 673.

253
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,530
The engine is intact.

254
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,470
Nothing wrong with the undercarriage and wings.

255
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,510
673,

256
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,500
The runway will be opened up in 30 minutes.

257
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,370
Got it.

258
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,390
Oh, no.

259
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,490
The minister comes.

260
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,970
Our plan is changed.

261
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,150
Get on 923 and take off forcibly.

262
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,910
Captain, we can't leave without you.

263
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,290
Complete the task.

264
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,340
Captain!

265
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,740
You mean the pilots decide it?

266
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,030
Control tower.

267
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,500
923 applies to fly.

268
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,540
Your request is permitted.

269
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,630
Tonight is with low air pressure and high humidity.

270
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,790
Fly with caution.

271
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,430
923 receives. We're taking off.

272
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,490
Minister.

273
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,390
Zhang Qi.

274
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,990
The plane will leave in 30 minutes

275
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,010
but why are you still here?

276
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,210
Minister.

277
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,670
I have something to report to you.

278
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,300
What is more important than getting on the plane?

279
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,820
Hanguang Squadron is defecting!

280
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,090
673!

281
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,670
You can't take off without permission.

282
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,230
Three degrees towards the left.

283
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,390
Three degrees towards the left.

284
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,710
673, 673!

285
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,910
Zou Shenghong, prepare to fight.

286
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,820
Fire back if anyone attacks.

287
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,890
Got it.

288
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,070
Zhang Qi.

289
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,470
Why did it take off?

290
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,190
Tell me!

291
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,340
Where are they going?

292
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,710
Tang Shizhen!

293
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,590
Here's the chart.

294
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,190
It's Zhang Qi's scheme.

295
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,500
I've told you he's a communist!

296
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,740
You've fed an enemy.

297
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,390
Let me see how you can explain to Nanjing.

298
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,500
Go to intercept 673!

299
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,610
Yes.

300
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,670
Minister.

301
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,150
Hanguang Squadron drives 673 for business.

302
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,610
As I drop out without permission,

303
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,010
please punish me.

304
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,510
Zhang Qi.

305
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,020
Tell me. Where does it go?

306
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,930
Tang Shizhen.

307
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,020
Do you still believe in his words?

308
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,100
673 won't come back.

309
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,820
It's the end of your life today.

310
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,210
Minister.

311
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,260
Nice shoot.

312
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,710
Lu Ziyi can't stop the defection of Hanguang Squadron.

313
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,950
He only catches me.

314
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,340
It's not great merit.

315
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,710
But if he can topple you by it,

316
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,910
you won't let him off so easily.

317
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,370
Zhang Qi.

318
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,870
It's all your plan, right?

319
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,670
It's a good chance for us.

320
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,060
Lu Ziyi has killed so many people

321
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,630
so I won't let him get the chance
to harm my family and comrades.

322
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,610
So what do you want to do?

323
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,910
I've prepared him a fantasy gift.

324
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,340
I've done something...

325
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,100
to that map.

326
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,710
When did you join the Communist Party?

327
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,470
On eighth March 1938.

328
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,990
1938?

329
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,470
Eight years!

330
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,300
You've deceived me for eight years!

331
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,500
I've been protecting you from Lu Ziyi.

332
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,330
Don't you think you let our government down?

333
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,870
Sir.

334
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,580
The reason why I haven't left
is that I hope you can join us.

335
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,250
I've been educated since childhood.

336
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,470
Then I joined the army and became a pilot.

337
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,540
The reason why I joined the Communist Party

338
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,260
is that I want to save our nation.

339
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,060
I know you've spent half of your life
finding ways to save our nation.

340
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,150
Anyhow, what we've done in the past

341
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,780
was to bring misfortune to the whole nation!

342
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,870
I felt guilty to you

343
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,230
but nothing to our nation.

344
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,630
Zhang Qi.

345
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,110
I've pledged loyalty to
Chinese Nationalist Party all my life.

346
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,910
I know it's rotten to the core

347
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,910
but I'm the superlative commander of the school,

348
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,540
the captain of the plane.

349
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,470
I will be with it forever!

350
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,500
I have long since suspected you're a communist.

351
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,990
I thought we could disregard

352
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,300
our different political views
and cooperate together.

353
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,260
"Saving our nation by aviation".

354
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,590
What about you?

355
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,890
You've changed.

356
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,210
Sir.

357
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,130
The one who has changed is you.

358
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,210
Minister!

359
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,370
Minister!

360
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,790
Minister!

361
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,870
Zhang Qi.

362
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:52,630
I've been waiting for today for long.

363
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,150
I must kill you today.

364
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,630
Zhang Qi.

365
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,390
Zhang Qi!

366
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,580
Adjutant Da, come over here!

367
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,230
Let's take him to the car.

368
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,300
Watch out.

369
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,730
This way.

370
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,430
Fly to Yan'an?

371
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,190
You've seen that

372
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,670
Lu Ziyi carried a map of flying to Yan'an.

373
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,430
He instigated Hanguang Squadron to defect.

374
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,340
He hurt Captain Zhang when he wanted to stop him.

375
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,910
At the same time, he shot Minister Tang.

376
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,910
He deserves to be executed.

377
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,260
It's a serious political accident.

378
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,780
No one here can escape from it.

379
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,540
Everyone here will be punished with death penalty.

380
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:05,340
As I'm one of the leaders of Yunnan Aviation Defense,

381
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,630
I'll be responsible for it.

382
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,430
If someone comes to investigate,

383
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,350
whoever wants to be alive

384
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,670
keeps quiet and says nothing.

385
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,850
Yes.

386
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,890
Zhang Qi!

387
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,780
Zhang Qi.

388
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,630
Zhang...

389
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,330
Be careful.

390
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,970
Why am I sleeping?

391
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,540
Calm down.

392
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,590
Watch out!

393
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,500
My daddy has joined us.

394
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,340
What about 673?

395
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,490
673 has taken off.

396
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Wujiaba Airport didn't stop them.

397
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,190
They'll arrive in northeast China

398
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,430
and attend to set up our own air force school.

399
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,350
Comrade Zhanlu.

400
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,350
The uprising of Hanguang Squadron
is of great significance.

401
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,060
Though you don't have too many people,

402
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,430
your sincerity and unity to our party

403
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,430
will influence more and more people.

404
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,310
All the rubbings of Mr. Ling Wenyue's research

405
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,350
will be sent to Peiping at any costs.

406
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,830
Comrade Zhanlu.

407
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,390
There's a new mission for you.

408
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,540
My comrades!

409
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,500
The People's Republic of China

410
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,540
and the Central Government

411
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,700
are established today!

412
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,950
On 1st October 1949,

413
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,750
17 planes were inspected
on the founding ceremony of PRC,

414
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:33,220
which exhibited Chinese Air Force's power
and determination of protecting our airspace.

415
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,130
[1956. In Kunming.]

416
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,620
The background of Chinese culture
is different from the Western's.

417
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,220
And we have diverse scenery.

418
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,540
We explore the world

419
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,540
by opening our eyes to see the affairs there

420
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,660
and closing our eyes to reflect on ourselves.

421
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,570
Everyone.

422
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,430
Please close our eyes
and reflect on ourselves by hearing the rain.

423
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,180
My students. You'll be our future teachers.

424
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,580
What you're like is what your student will be.

425
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,650
Teachers draw power from the light and the warmth.

426
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,130
The most critical spirit

427
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,620
of our Normal College in Fuhua University

428
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,700
is to spread the light.

429
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,100
Let's close our eyes together

430
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,140
and reflect on ourselves by hearing the rain.

431
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,910
On 19th July 1956,

432
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,430
the prototype of J-5 with all domestic parts

433
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,620
completed the test flight successfully.

434
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,910
It marked that China was capable of

435
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,620
manufacturing Jet Fighters in batches.

436
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,830
Grandma.

437
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,620
What kind of person is our dad?

438
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,790
Is he good or bad?

439
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,020
How can you say so?

440
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,350
Your father is really a good man.

441
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,830
But why hasn't he come back till now?
