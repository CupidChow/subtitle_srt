[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,159
Using the excuse that Mr. Ling and Haitang will

4
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,760
hand over oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

5
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,599
we could cheat Okayama here.

6
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,879
If things go well,

7
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,239
Okayama will be here in two days with Mr. Meng.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,159
By then, Nianqiao and I

9
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,200
should have made explosives and fuel.

10
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,840
At that time, Haitang could show up

11
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,640
and Zhenzhu could meet on the side.

12
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,640
Mr. Ling and Mr. Zeng could hide in...

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
Mr. Meng.

14
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,599
Mr. Meng.

15
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
I'm sorry to make you stay here.

16
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,960
This remote place can't compare with your house.

17
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,360
You suffered a lot.

18
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,599
I'm really sorry.

19
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,599
Mr. Meng.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,840
I thought you must be hungry.

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,319
I made you sashimi myself.

22
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,360
We used the fish from the Salween.

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,759
Mr. Meng, please taste it.

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,800
That's what you call it.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,280
We call it Nujiang River.

26
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,319
Nu means being angry.

27
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,759
Mr. Meng, don't be so excited.

28
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,479
You shouldn't be angry.

29
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,039
Have a taste. It's very fresh.

30
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,560
It seems that you're not hungry.

31
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,039
Since you're not hungry,

32
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,000
let's get down to business.

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,439
Secretary General Meng,

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,199
Counterfeit Calendar of Yin

35
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,879
records my research achievements.

36
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,759
Regardless of national boundaries,

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,319
diverse voices should be allowed in research.

38
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,599
Mr. Meng, please be generous with your comments.

39
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,000
Mr. Meng,

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,280
I forget to tell you.

41
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,240
Mr. Ling has heard that you're here.

42
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,599
He has also arrived in western Yunnan.

43
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,000
He's waiting to meet you.

44
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,800
I believe that with your support,

45
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,319
Mr. Ling will be willing to

46
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,800
integrate his research results into my work.

47
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,240
I'm really happy about it.

48
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,240
How about that?

49
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,599
You two could go to Japan

50
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,319
to study east Asian cultures together.

51
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,039
Is it a good idea?

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,560
Mr. Okayama,

53
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,159
the profound culture of a country or a nation

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,120
comes from the accumulation of past dynasties.

55
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,920
Japan doesn't have

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,839
grand and profound philosophy,

57
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,680
nor does it lack

58
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
foresight and profound thinking.

59
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,399
So you always want to

60
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,879
steal it from others

61
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,120
and make it your own.

62
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,240
How could that be possible?

63
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,879
Oracle Bone Inscriptions have been in China

64
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,040
for more than 3,000 years.

65
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,519
It predates the origin of Japanese nation.

66
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,759
You can't take it from us by snatching a few pieces of

67
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,959
Oracle Bone Inscriptions and writing a book.

68
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,079
It cannot be part of
your so-called Japanese Sinology.

69
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,519
You can't conclude

70
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,959
the origin of our Chinese language.

71
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,480
Three years ago,

72
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,879
the publication of Study
on the Yin Dynasty Calendar was suspended.

73
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,759
I was very angry.

74
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,399
I thought that

75
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,079
he didn't understand how hard times were

76
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,319
and how hard it was to run a school.

77
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,160
Now I understand him.

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,120
His decision was right.

79
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,680
What's a university?

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,199
The purpose of a university is
to pursue eternal truths

81
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,000
with independent thinking.

82
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,800
Since China has

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,879
a large number of scholars like Mr. Ling,

84
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,680
they can keep spines straight

85
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,319
when the country is poor and weak.

86
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,000
When the nation revives,

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,439
they can become pillars of our nation.

88
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,160
Even if we fall for a hundred years,

89
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,279
we will rise again and

90
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,720
astonish the world.

91
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,439
On the other hand,

92
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,639
if Japan is full of

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,879
liars and plunderers like Mr. Okayama,

94
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,319
even if it is strong now,

95
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,439
it will fail in the end.

96
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:23,839
Your book is like fish in this plate.

97
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,160
Tomorrow it will be rancid and disgusting.

98
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,279
Mr. Meng,

99
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,079
it seems to me that you could

100
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,000
do nothing but saying these words.

101
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,199
Since it is so,

102
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,439
I'll tell you the truth.

103
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Ling Wenyue sent me this letter.

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,360
I'll take you to trade with them tomorrow.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,040
Your daughter will also

106
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,800
give oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding to me.

107
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,879
I'm sure I'll win this time.

108
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,319
Okayama,

109
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,079
you are so mean.

110
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,720
My daughter has nothing to do with it.

111
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
Mr. Meng, Mr. Meng,

112
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,800
I understand. I understand.

113
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,160
Your daughter is

114
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,439
Mr. Ling's assistant.

115
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,000
I won't hurt her.

116
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,120
You should relax.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,040
I also admit that

118
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,600
there are many excellent people in China

119
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,800
such as Mr. Meng and Mr. Ling.

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,839
But netizens of your country

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,199
are not the same.

122
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,240
Mr. Meng,

123
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,839
the aim of my book is to

124
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,639
let your country have

125
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,839
more people like Wang Jingwei and Zhou Fohai.

126
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
Mr. Meng,

127
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,120
I'll prove it to you.

128
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,759
Don't you talk about

129
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,240
big countries and small countries?

130
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,040
As a citizen of a small country,

131
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,240
I'll destroy the cultural confidence

132
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,480
of your decadent country right in your face.

133
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,759
Get out.

134
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,439
Get out.

135
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
Mr. Meng, enjoy the food.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,920
So many people have been looking for him all day.

137
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,360
But you still haven't found Song Zixiang.

138
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,919
Someone from the Youth Army deserted.

139
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,519
If it gets out,

140
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
the political department will lose face.

141
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,679
Send more people to look for him.

142
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,840
Meng,

143
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,360
lead the team yourself.

144
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,919
We have to find this man.

145
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,480
Bring him to me, dead or alive.

146
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,559
Yes.

147
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,519
Okayama.

148
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,639
It's me. It's Li Donglai.

149
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,639
Get down.

150
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,039
Where are we gonna find him

151
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,600
in the middle of the night?

152
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,320
If Song Zixiang wants to escape,

153
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,399
just let him do it.

154
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,759
Why did you turn him in?

155
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,679
Now it's us who's suffering.

156
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,600
You don't understand it.

157
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,679
I think it's a good opportunity for promotion.

158
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Have you found Song Zixiang?

159
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,039
Not yet, sir.

160
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,960
Keep searching.

161
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,799
Yes.

162
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,759
Let's go.

163
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,399
I still can't feel assured.

164
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,840
That road?

165
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,879
Sir,

166
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
You said the tung oil wouldn't be ready

167
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,200
until 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,120
Can you speed it up?

169
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,600
Please show some respect to science.

170
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,000
Refining is a delicate job.

171
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,120
Besides, we're refining bio-oil.

172
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,720
With one careless move,

173
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,240
it could blow up.

174
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Although time is tight,

175
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,159
I still believe father will finish it in time.

176
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,919
Anyway,

177
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,320
I think it's too dangerous

178
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
for Haitang to meet Okayama Shinichi alone.

179
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,320
Yes, it's too dangerous.

180
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,840
She's still a child.

181
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,399
Right.

182
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,799
Is Haitang alright?

183
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,960
You should go and see her.

184
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,000
Come here. Sit.

185
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,600
What are you thinking?

186
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
My dad.

187
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,799
The weather in Miao Guan is wet.

188
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,879
And his waist is not good.

189
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,799
Maybe he'll feel uncomfortable.

190
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,679
Don't worry.

191
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,080
I'll get him out of there tomorrow.

192
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,159
Haitang,

193
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,159
The deal with Okayama tomorrow is still on me.

194
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,440
You go back to Jianling

195
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,840
with Mr. Ling and Zhenzhu.

196
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,960
No.

197
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Okayama wouldn't trade with you

198
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,120
if Mr. Ling and I weren't here.

199
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,120
Even if you set the trap well,

200
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,840
a fox won't jump into it.

201
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,559
Besides,

202
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,559
Nianqiao and you

203
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,200
have to pilot Xishan and the bomber.

204
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,000
You won't have time to do it.

205
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,080
Zhang Qi,

206
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I can't let you protect me
all the time during the war.

207
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,799
I want you to know that you're not alone.

208
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,879
That's the fight for all of us.

209
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,919
Do you remember when we flew together

210
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,720
on the Fuxing seven years ago?

211
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,600
How could I forget it?

212
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,919
That's your declaration of freedom.

213
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,879
Seven years later,

214
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,039
I can finally stand with you

215
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,399
and fight side by side.

216
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,480
I wouldn't have anything to regret
even if I were dead.

217
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,200
Promise me one thing.

218
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,440
What?

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,159
In case of danger,

220
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,159
save my father and Uncle Ling first.

221
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,639
I won't leave anyone behind.

222
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,879
Don't go out until they're far away.

223
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,200
Why haven't you left Xiangping

224
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,279
after such a long time?

225
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,639
I've been to most places in China.

226
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,320
I haven't expected to be trapped

227
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,759
in such a position now.

228
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,519
I went around in circles all day.

229
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,600
The Mountain stretches for hundreds of miles.

230
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,639
Magnetic field is chaotic.

231
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,200
Luckily, Xiangping is on the edge of Yemang Mountain.

232
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,919
You are smart that you didn't

233
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,720
go deep into the mountains.

234
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,000
Right. Let me show you this.

235
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,919
What's that?

236
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,240
That's the map that our Air Force Officer School

237
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,679
airdropped to General Du in1942

238
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,919
when he was trapped in Yemang Mountain.

239
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,519
I brought it here on purpose.

240
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,480
Knowing the training is in Xiangping,

241
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,639
I brought it with me.

242
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,320
You see.

243
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,440
Now we are here.

244
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,840
Go this way and we'll get to Hongshi.

245
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,440
That's the place where

246
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,879
my dad built the lab for Uncle Zeng.

247
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,120
It's me who helped him pilot Xishan here.

248
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,919
Go this way and we'll get to Jianling.

249
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,279
You could go to Jianling.

250
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,919
There's a long distance call in the town hall.

251
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,399
Hungry?

252
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,279
I'm not hungry.

253
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,399
I have walked 4000 miles with your sister.

254
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,200
I've suffered a lot.

255
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,440
Haichen, what's that?

256
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,440
It smells good.

257
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,679
Use it.

258
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,320
Ok.

259
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,799
You don't want some?

260
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm not hungry.

261
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,359
What are you thinking?

262
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,200
My dad.

263
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,759
I wonder why he would always choose to help Ling.

264
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,039
As long as Uncle Ling is in danger,

265
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,599
he's always the first man to come out

266
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,200
and stand in front of Uncle Ling.

267
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,960
They are good friends.

268
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,039
I think it's more than just friendship.

269
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,640
My father understands the value of Uncle Ling

270
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,920
and his own responsibility.

271
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,839
When I was eight years old,

272
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,240
he became the president of
School of Chinese Studies.

273
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,000
The first thing he did is

274
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,160
to put his beloved pen into a box.

275
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,200
He said that from that day,

276
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,480
he's not only a scholar

277
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,960
who writes books.

278
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,799
His responsibility is to help

279
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,039
other scholars like Uncle Ling to write books,

280
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,480
inherit culture and educate people.

281
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,440
Right.

282
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:11,960
Before stopping writing,

283
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,119
he wrote several words.

284
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,400
What?

285
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,119
I'd like to be a pawn in the army.

286
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,119
My dad spent half his life being a pawn.

287
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,000
Uncle Meng is a great man.

288
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,759
Don't worry, Haichen.

289
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,480
We will bring Uncle Meng back safely.

290
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,680
I trust you.

291
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,200
Let's talk about you.

292
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,720
What's your plan?

293
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,599
You can't spend the rest of your life as a fugitive.

294
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,880
I can't go back to Fuhua.

295
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,480
Maybe they even

296
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,480
went to my mom's house in Shang Village.

297
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,880
I hope my mom and Haitang

298
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,519
won't think I really ran away.

299
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,279
Haichen,

300
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,200
where do you think I should go

301
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,640
to actually fight the Japanese?

302
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,720
You can't join the National Revolutionary Army.

303
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,839
Right.

304
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,680
You could go to Yan'an.

305
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,200
Yan'an?

306
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,400
Yes.

307
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,799
I've been secretly listening to the radio

308
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,799
of the Communist Party.

309
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,319
The National Revolutionary Army lost

310
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,559
more than 200,000 square kilometers of land

311
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,880
and 60 million people this year.

312
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,839
But the Communists launched

313
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,160
partial counter-offensives

314
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,799
in northern, central and southern China,

315
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,359
recovered much of the country

316
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,799
and freed 17 million people from the Japanese.

317
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,759
The Communist Party is
sincere in resisting Japan.

318
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,720
Besides,

319
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,559
I used to think that

320
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,119
our army was the elite one.

321
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,039
But in the past two years I thought

322
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
the Communist Party was really good at fighting

323
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:56,880
and winning.

324
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,039
OK. Yan'an.

325
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,799
Haichen,

326
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
how about going together?

327
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,079
I've thought about it.

328
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,279
I've been thinking about it

329
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,880
since Hanguang Squadron was disbanded.

330
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,640
I've been a flight instructor for three years.

331
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,680
But I haven't even touched a trainer.

332
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,119
They didn't trust me.

333
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,720
The only thing I can be proud of in my life

334
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,079
is the fight on November 17th.

335
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,960
075 reaches formation height and

336
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,240
fights side by side with you.

337
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,240
095 075

338
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,039
Scissor crossing. Tail covering.

339
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,480
I get it up to 20,000 meters.

340
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,720
The engine may fail under overload.

341
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,559
When I dive, you get a chance to hit it.

342
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,920
I also look forward to the captain to come back

343
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,400
and lead Hanguang Squadron to

344
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,240
fly into the sky again.

345
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,839
Donglai, do you believe it?

346
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,319
I'm sure that day will come.

347
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,000
I won't believe others.

348
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,960
But I believe in my brother.

349
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:14,880
Yes.

350
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,799
I'm waiting for him to come back.

351
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,240
Before he comes back,

352
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,440
I won't go anywhere.

353
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,920
And I'll never run away in the rest of my life.

354
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,400
But if...

355
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,960
I mean if possible.

356
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,960
If Kuomintang is at war with

357
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,720
the Communist Party,

358
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,519
and we are on our respective sides,

359
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,960
will we fight against each other?

360
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,400
Impossible.

361
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,000
I would never point my gun at Chinese.

362
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,200
Besides, at that time

363
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,000
maybe I would join the Communist Party
with the captain.

364
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,000
Haichen,

365
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,400
what do you want to do

366
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
after the war?

367
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,039
I think I would have been killed in battle by then.

368
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,680
Nonsense. We're safe and sound.

369
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,519
Your bones are so fine

370
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,640
and your complexion is so good

371
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,759
that you should expect to live to be ninety.

372
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,839
At that time,

373
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,440
an old man as you

374
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,000
lie on bed.

375
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,160
All around you are

376
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,880
your great grandchildren shouting

377
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,079
don't leave us, grandpa!

378
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:43,880
Stop. Stop.

379
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,759
Seriously,

380
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,759
what do you want to do after the war?

381
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll find Lieutenant Li first.

382
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,319
She used to refuse me.

383
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,200
But I'm a grown man.

384
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
I'm not afraid to be refused.

385
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,920
I want to tell her that

386
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,319
she has always been

387
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,680
in my heart for all those years.

388
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,279
Donglai,

389
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,039
I can't accompany you anymore.

390
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,799
Go to Jianling to deliver the message.

391
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,400
OK, Haichen.

392
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,680
Then wait for my news.

393
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,000
Why is there a way?

394
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,119
Boss,

395
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,559
they're almost done.

396
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:12,759
Director,

397
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,400
the road is almost finished.

398
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,759
Even armored vehicles can pass through here.

399
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,319
Ok.

400
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,039
The war is about to start.

401
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,000
We have to go back to Longling overnight

402
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,240
and then fly back to Kunming.

403
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,839
Remember to bring Xiao Hong'en with us.

404
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,440
And transport a few more trucks of oil.

405
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:30,160
OK.

406
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,680
Everyone!

407
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,799
Let's call it a day.

408
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,240
Everyone, be quick.

409
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:37,920
This way. Be quick.

410
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,400
Go. Go.

411
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,680
Xu,

412
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,359
hurry up.

413
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,200
Do you know why

414
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,759
you were asked to repair this road overnight?

415
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,720
That's because we want to do business.

416
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,400
With this road,

417
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,359
our fuel oil will continue to be shipped to Kunming.

418
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,240
The Japanese also need this road.

419
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,559
With this road,

420
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,960
the Japanese could keep Mongyu and

421
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,480
western Yun'an in their hands.

422
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,039
What does he mean?

423
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,519
After 18 hours,

424
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,200
the Japanese 56th Division
will reinforce Mongyu.

425
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,440
The weather here is so wet.

426
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,759
How could we let you know this?

427
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,759
What are you doing?

428
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,359
Are you a soldier or not?

429
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,200
Stop.

430
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,720
Give me the map.

431
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,680
This road is not on the map.

432
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,160
It's a new one.

433
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,480
Now I know.

434
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,960
The New 22nd Division is fighting at Mongyu.

435
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,559
The Japanese 56th Division will

436
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,759
reinforce Mongyu by this road in 18 hours.

437
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,119
Traitors!

438
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,480
Listen.

439
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,759
You have to deliver this message to them.

440
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,359
That's more important than saving my dad.

441
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,240
Find a way to inform Zhang Qi.

442
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,279
No.

443
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,400
I can't watch them get killed.

444
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:23,720
Give me the gun.

445
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,680
Go by yourself.

446
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,599
I have received strict military training.

447
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,000
I will deal with it.

448
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,240
You run faster than me.

449
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,720
You said that I can't

450
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,680
catch up with you my whole life.

451
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,680
Haichen.

452
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,279
That's given by a student soldier
seven years ago.

453
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,759
He said that

454
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,119
people could find his way home by wearing it.

455
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,960
Don't get lost again.

456
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:46,839
You should go.

457
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,960
Go.

458
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,440
Go.

459
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,240
Let's go.

460
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:03,799
Let's go.

461
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,000
Goodbye, Meng Haichen.

462
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,559
Sir,

463
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,160
another man grabbed the car and ran away.

464
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,400
You bastards!

465
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,119
Send more people to find this guy.

466
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,359
Otherwise I'll kill you.

467
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,920
Yes.

468
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,960
Was it Song Zixiang who just ran away?

469
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,440
Where did he go?

470
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,440
Don't waste time.

471
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,359
I'll be dead.

472
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
I won't tell you.

473
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,000
Meng,

474
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,759
I gave you the opportunity three years ago.

475
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,839
But you didn't listen.

476
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,920
Today you are making trouble again.

477
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,359
So don't blame me for being ruthless.

478
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,039
Have you ever been to Yue Temple In Hangzhou?

479
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,240
Inside the temple,

480
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,000
Qin Hui and his wife have

481
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,519
knelt at Yue Fei's tomb

482
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,480
for more than four hundred years.

483
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,720
Tin iron was used to cast the image of Qin Hui!

484
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Lu Ziyi,

485
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,820
guess what tomb you'll be on your knees in.

486
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,599
You'll be infamous.

487
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:58,759
Fine.

488
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Then I'll let this mountain have the honor

489
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,039
to bury your loyal bones.

490
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,519
Xu, it's your turn.

491
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:19,640
I'll give you one last chance.

492
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,640
Where's Song Zixiang?

493
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,920
Tell me and I won't torture you anymore.

494
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,880
He'll go to Yan'an.

495
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes.

496
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:20,880
Meng Haichen.

497
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,119
I'll bring you home.

498
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,640
2127 lift off.

499
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,279
The destination is Yemang Mountain, Hongshi.

500
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,960
The cloud height is 3000-7000.

501
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,440
The colud cover is 5-7.

502
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:20,200
2127 has an altitude of 2100,

503
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,400
a speed of 400

504
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,960
and a heading of 130.

505
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,119
Good heading, altitude and speed.

506
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,880
We will arrive at the designated bombing site
in two hours.

507
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,000
The bomber checks the magazine.

508
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,839
Bomber understands.

509
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,279
Check the magazine. The magazine is normal.

510
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,000
Task Code: Hongshi.

511
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,560
[24 hours before (18:10, January 20th)
Wujiaba Airport, Kunming]

512
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,200
Director,

513
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,119
I just got the news.

514
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,799
Kang Lanshan from Fuhua University

515
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,559
was contacting journalists in the US and Europe,

516
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,799
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar by Ling Wenyue

517
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,759
will be released tomorrow.

518
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,000
Besides,

519
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
I also got news from Okayama.

520
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,119
Zeng Mu from School of Science and Engineering

521
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,039
has a laboratory in Hongshi Mountains.

522
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,640
They may have obtained samples
from Jing'an oil field.

523
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,519
I'm afraid it's not good for us.

524
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,200
What a tough guy.

525
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,400
Where's Zhang Qi?

526
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,519
Zhang Qi?

527
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,519
Tang Shizhen sent him to the Ninth Factory.

528
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,039
But I heard the other day that

529
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,279
he and Zeng Nianqiao had gone missing.

530
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,000
Go missing again?

531
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,680
They're making trouble.

532
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,240
Tell Xu Te to blow up the lab

533
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,119
so there's nothing left.

534
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:13,960
Director,

535
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,799
we only have a general location of the lab.

536
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,480
If they set out,

537
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,839
the time may be a little too late.

538
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,680
Bring him here.

539
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,319
Yes.

540
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,279
That's the oil sample from Jing'an Oil field.

541
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,559
Zhenzhu has also been investigating the case

542
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,720
of the Xishan accident.

543
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,200
She also learned about Jing'an oil field and

544
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,599
the refinery from local warlords.

545
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,839
The abnormal fuel consumption

546
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,880
of Xishan driven by Poshan was due to this oil.

547
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,960
Since Lu Ziyi was

548
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,839
transferred to the aviation school,

549
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,880
he has controlled the procurement channels
for jet fuel.

550
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,519
For this reason,

551
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,720
Tang Shizhen even went to Nanjing to complain.

552
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,400
But he didn't make it.

553
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,920
There must be something fishy going on here.

554
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,519
Sir,

555
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,679
having this sample in hand,

556
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,800
we must find out the reason of Xishan accident

557
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,199
after going back to Kunming.

558
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,960
Brave men die in numerous battles.

559
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,800
Moths are fat for a while.

560
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,840
Come back after adding tung oil
and take this sample.

561
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,000
I'll go with you.

562
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,159
OK.

563
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,159
Those planes can't crash for nothing.

564
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,360
People like Poshan

565
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,039
can't die for nothing.

566
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,079
Director,

567
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,280
Okayama said that

568
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,079
Ling Wenyue and Meng Haitang took

569
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,199
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding
to save Meng Wuran.

570
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,719
I didn't expect Ling Wenyue

571
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,320
to be such a good player.

572
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,719
He went to deceive Okayama himself.

573
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,840
And he asked his wife to

574
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,400
open the news conference of

575
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,679
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

576
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,199
Then will we get our money on schedule?

577
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,079
Xu Te, that's your only "advantage".

578
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,800
You can always find

579
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,679
what others don't want to hear.

580
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
That Japanese man is so mean.

581
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,400
He didn't succeed himself,

582
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,480
and he won't give us the money.

583
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,039
Damn it.

584
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,199
Ling Wenyue and Kang Lanshan

585
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,599
are not smart enough to have this idea.

586
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,199
There must be someone helping them.

587
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,519
Song Zixiang,
who ran away the day before yesterday,

588
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,320
was formerly known as Li Donglai.

589
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,760
He's the brother of Ding Huansheng.

590
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,039
Ding Huansheng is a communist.

591
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,199
That's for sure.

592
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,679
Then there's only one possibility.

593
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,440
The Communist Party stepped in.

594
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,639
Director, then you mean...

595
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,599
I want to see how many birds can be killed

596
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
if a stone is dropped.

597
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,800
Those from Fuhua,

598
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,400
Hanguang and the Communist Party.

599
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,800
Three.

600
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,599
And the initiator of evil,

601
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
Okayama Shinichi .

602
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,119
Right.

603
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,519
Let's kill them all.

604
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,440
But the release conference is far away

605
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
from Yemang Mountain.

606
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,559
What should we do?

607
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,800
It has nothing to do with me.

608
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,199
It's only about you.

609
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,360
I'm just a spectator.

610
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,000
Director,

611
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,599
you do watch for fun.

612
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,719
But this time it's your own business.

613
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,039
I can give you a chance.

614
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,599
Take your men to Longling Airport and

615
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,559
ambush them at the Hongshi Lab.

616
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,440
Keep an eye on them.

617
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:43,480
Kill everyone who comes out.

618
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,519
Don't come to see me again

619
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:47,760
if you can't accomplish this task.

620
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,559
Yes.

621
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Where's my daughter?

622
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,280
I told you to keep an eye on her.

623
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,320
You sent two men with her.

624
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:17,280
Now even those two guys are lost.

625
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,000
And they become her confidants.

626
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,360
I haven't heard from her in days.

627
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,239
Supervisor,

628
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,960
she always acts like this.

629
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,320
You don't have to worry too much.

630
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,719
She'll be back by herself in a couple of days.

631
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,159
Master.

632
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,320
Master.

633
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,960
Director Lu from Aviation Council is coming.

634
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,880
Director Lu is here late at night.

635
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,960
What can I do for you?

636
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,559
I'll get straight to the point.

637
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,440
There is an accident in Jing'an oil field.

638
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,480
Don't you know it?

639
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,480
Zeng Mu, a professor

640
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,440
who disturbed the military court three years ago,

641
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,559
has been secretly investigating this oil field.

642
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,199
It is said that he has got the sample

643
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,000
and will return to Kunming to submit it formally

644
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,320
in the next two days.

645
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,360
What does that have to do with me?

646
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,800
Why do people in Chongqing keep bothering you?

647
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,400
Why did a large number of central army

648
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,760
enter Kunming
and set up the Yunnan Cadre Training Regiment?

649
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,920
They're trying to take power from you.

650
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:50,199
Do you still want to give them an excuse?

651
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,159
I'll let you see my secret.

652
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,440
That's my secret.

653
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,440
How about it?

654
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,480
How about it? How about it?

655
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,119
That's a bomb shelter which leads directly to the wind tunnel.

656
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,440
Want to have a look inside?

657
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,440
I'd like to go.

658
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Be careful. Be careful.

659
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,159
Be careful.

660
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:19,880
Be careful. Be careful.

661
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,800
Captain, be careful.

662
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,880
What are you laughing at?

663
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,960
Uncle Ling's right.

664
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,719
He said you came to western Yunnan to drill holes.

665
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,519
He's right.

666
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,320
Wait.

667
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,519
Drilling holes?

668
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,800
You helped him mock me before

669
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,400
he becomes your father-in-law.

670
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,079
My life is for physics of China.

671
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,840
Can you afford it without digging a few holes?

672
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,039
Yes.

673
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,920
Father's life is for the future jets.

674
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,639
Answer me.

675
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:03,440
What did you murmur when you had malaria?

676
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:04,840
I...

677
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,559
You were in a daze.

678
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,000
You said

679
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:09,000
dad, I feel uncomfortable.

680
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,440
Don't you usually call me father?

681
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,960
I can't remember.

682
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,480
Do you remember it?

683
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,960
You called me dad

684
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,960
when I picked you up as a kid.

685
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,320
That's because I was young.

686
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,360
I didn't understand.

687
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,800
When I grew up,

688
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,840
I learned that only Poshan could call you dad.

689
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,880
I could only call you father.

690
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,199
But I also know that

691
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:44,199
you love and cherish me.

692
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,440
You teach me to be an honest man.

693
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,719
If it were not for you,

694
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,239
there would be no Zeng Nianqiao today.

695
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,320
That's what you thought?

696
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,599
Then if you like,

697
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,719
you could call me dad in the future.

698
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,599
Dad.
