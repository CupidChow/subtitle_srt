[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,700
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,079
After finishing your task at that day,

4
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,879
according to Minister Tang's order,

5
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,319
you should have returned immediately.

6
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,120
Why did you take off again?

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,000
And who gave the order?

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,959
You have two choices now.

9
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,000
One is,

10
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,879
Zhang Qi and Zeng Nianqiao die together

11
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,519
with you.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,719
The other is,

13
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,640
Zhang Qi dies alone.

14
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,599
Think carefully about what you should say.

15
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,199
I gave the order.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,719
It seems that

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,240
Judge Lu,

18
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,000
as a senior commander,

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
you don't know much about

20
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
the hierarchical management
of our front-line operations.

21
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,039
My immediate superior is Minister Tang.

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,759
And the immediate superior
of Meng Haichen and Zeng Nianqiao

23
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,080
is me, Captain of Hanguang Squadron.

24
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,719
They follow my marching orders.

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,800
If I give them the order

26
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,000
and they dare not take off,

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,360
I have the right to shoot any deserter.

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,840
So,

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
I'll take full responsibility.

30
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,599
On November 17th,

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,560
Zeng Nianqiao drove the plane

32
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,280
to drop the floating bombs.

33
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,439
Meng Haichen diverted the enemy's aircraft
for the patrol aircraft.

34
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,240
They're under my order.

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,199
On the return voyage,

36
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,240
they also followed my order

37
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,199
to take off and fight the enemy.

38
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,080
Minister only asked me to take responsibility for taking off.

39
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,439
About this,

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,840
you can question the witnesses.

41
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,479
Chief Judge,

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,039
this is consistent with
the testimony of other witnesses.

43
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,639
Meng Haichen.

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,199
you may leave.

45
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,879
I am responsible for the takeoff operation.

46
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,639
It's not like what Captain said.

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
Leave the court immediately.

48
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,520
Just let him speak.

49
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,840
But I'm a little tired.

50
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,280
Let's take an adjournment.

51
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,319
Adjourn.

52
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,479
If we lose the Hanguang Squadron,

53
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,599
it's detrimental to Yunnan air defense.

54
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,120
Then what about your opinion, Supervisor?

55
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,560
Tang Shizhen will not leave Zhang Qi alone.

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
He must take actions.

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,279
We have only one thing to do.

58
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,000
Putting it off.

59
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,639
Okay.

60
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,040
Supervisor,

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,199
you're exhausted recently.

62
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,759
I'll notify the court right now.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Ask them to take more adjournments.

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's see if Minister understands me.

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,480
On November 17th,

66
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,839
it's not only Captain who disobeyed.

67
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,560
I also disobeyed the order.

68
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,199
The fuel amount of 075,

69
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,319
under that circumstance,

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
can only last for ten minutes.

71
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,480
I disobeyed the order to turn back.

72
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,360
In 1938,

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,279
Hanguang Squadron

74
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,759
took the cost of losing the whole team

75
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,759
and disobeyed the order in Hangzhou

76
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,800
to protect people there.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
Half a year ago,

78
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,600
a member of the Hanguang Squadron,

79
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
Zeng Poshan disobeyed the order

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,839
to spare the people on the ground.

81
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,959
He missed the time of crash landing

82
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,959
and fell down with the aircraft.

83
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,439
I disobeyed the order

84
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,399
just to shoot down enemy planes

85
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,560
and protect the people.

86
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,639
If you find Captain guilty for our disobedience,

87
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,199
I'm unconvinced.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,480
I will appeal to the end.

89
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
Right.

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,199
We will appeal to the end.

91
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,040
Director Lu,

92
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,519
let me remind you.

93
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,519
Hanguang Squadron is a sharp weapon

94
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,519
that Kunming Air Defense depends on.

95
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,040
If the trial today shakes the army's morale,

96
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,040
none of us can bear the consequences.

97
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,720
Supervisor Bai,

98
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,600
please look at this material.

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
Meng Haichen.

100
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,480
What did you do
before you entered the Aviation School?

101
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,480
To be clear,

102
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,920
have you been in the army before?

103
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,399
Yes, I have.

104
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,959
What kind of service?

105
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,040
Which troops?

106
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,199
Where were you stationed?

107
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,240
The Land Army.

108
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
The 29th National Revolutionary Army.

109
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
The 37th Division.

110
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,480
The Military Academy Corps.

111
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,560
In July, 1937,

112
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,439
we were stationed in Nanyuan, Peping.

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,480
You used to be in the Army.

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,399
Why did you change to the Air Force?

115
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,319
I...

116
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,800
I was injured.

117
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,879
And the Military Academy Corps was dissolved
instead of being regimented.

118
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,040
You're injured.

119
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,959
Where are the wounds?

120
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,279
Meng Haichen.

121
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,120
I'll ask you again.

122
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,120
Where are the wounds?

123
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,439
On my back.

124
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,800
I was shot on the run.

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,199
Right.

126
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,920
I was a deserter.

127
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,199
After I received an order from Zhang Shouling,
the head of the Military Academy Corps,

128
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,600
that all battalions should withdraw,

129
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,199
I broke out with the Military Academy Corps

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,959
and got shot on the back.

131
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,920
We were forced to abandon Peping

132
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,360
and leave millions of people to the Japanese.

133
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Before that,

134
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,480
our military

135
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,079
abandoned the three northeastern provinces.

136
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,920
Weren't we deserters?

137
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,639
Then,

138
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,480
we lost half of China.

139
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,560
Weren't we deserters?

140
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,079
From 1931 to now,

141
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,240
it has been ten years
since Japan invaded our territory.

142
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,680
Our government

143
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,040
hasn't yet to declare war on Japan until now.

144
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,079
Peace talks are still under way.

145
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
The July 7th Incident,

146
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,879
an overall crisis for the Chinese nation.

147
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,560
It didn't happen at the border but in Peiping.

148
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,720
We let others invade into China's very heart.

149
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,920
Wasn't that humiliating?

150
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,320
Deserters got promoted.

151
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,000
Fighters was accused guilty.

152
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,519
Isn't this the greatest humiliation?

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,799
I admit that

154
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,240
I was a deserter.

155
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,039
But in the battle on November 17th,

156
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
I could drive away enemy aircraft
by disobeying orders.

157
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,919
I will die with no regrets.

158
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,320
Judges.

159
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
I, Meng Haichen,

160
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,360
admit that I'm guilty of disobeying military orders.

161
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,000
I wish to be punished
by the military law with Captain.

162
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,720
This time,

163
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,360
I will never be a deserter again.

164
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,759
Great speech.

165
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,000
But it's not relevant to this case.

166
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,240
Whether you are a deserter or not

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,480
will be judged after the 1117 case.

168
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,279
But today in this court,

169
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,600
you have no right to incite.

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,960
Take him down.

171
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,240
I have everyone's material of Hanguang Squadron.

172
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
You know what you've done before.

173
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,600
Don't give it all away here

174
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,279
to divert the direction of the whole trial.

175
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,780
[College of Science]

176
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,399
Have I miscalculated?

177
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,919
The important formula of alkyl lead,

178
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,759
how could I get it wrong?

179
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,679
Zeng Nianqiao.

180
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,600
What is this?

181
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,360
It's...

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
This is the wreckage of Xishan.

183
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,559
Although Zhang Qi

184
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,279
rebuilt a Xishan with its original frame.

185
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,000
There are still parts of the wreckage

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,240
stored in the 9th Aviation Manufacturing Plant.

187
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,360
Whose aircraft was Xishan?

188
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,639
How did it crash?

189
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,960
Please address it to the court.

190
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,919
Aircraft Xishan's pilot was Zeng Poshan.

191
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,559
In the 428 air battle, 1931,

192
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,240
it ran out of fuel

193
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,360
and crashed.

194
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,840
Then,

195
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,399
where's Zeng Poshan?

196
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,080
Pilot Zeng Poshan

197
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,120
missed the the height of parachuting
during the crash landing,

198
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
fell with the aircraft,

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,720
and died.

200
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Xishan crashed because it ran out of fuel.

201
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,759
But Zeng Po Shan died.

202
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,600
As far as I know,

203
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,360
the Hawk III Fighter has a main fuel tank
and an auxiliary fuel tank.

204
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,279
I read the records.

205
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,200
With the time in the air and the fuel,

206
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,879
that shouldn't have happened.

207
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,960
Xishan's auxiliary fuel tank has been removed.

208
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,080
Who did that?

209
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,000
Zeng Poshan?

210
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,919
No.

211
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,200
Before modifying the aircraft,

212
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,039
did you get the permission of the Aviation Council

213
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:44,720
or the written consent of Minister Tang?

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,240
In 1937,

215
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
Captain Gao Zhihang of the Forth Brigade

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,399
has modified the Hawk III Fighter.

217
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,159
Otherwise there wouldn't be 814 victory.

218
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,480
Though Captain modified the fighter

219
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,519
without the written consent
of the Aviation Council or Minister Tang,

220
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,320
it's the superior's tacit consent.

221
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,399
The tacit consent.

222
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,840
Can the tacit consent be considered evidence?

223
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,679
If the auxiliary fuel tank hadn't been removed,

224
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,399
Xishan wouldn't have crashed.

225
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,320
Pilot Zeng Poshan,

226
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,879
who was trained with huge costs,

227
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,759
wouldn't have died.

228
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:23,840
And Zhang Qi,

229
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,360
as a Captain,

230
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,919
instead of protecting the pilots and the fighters,

231
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,639
he vandalized expensive combat weapons.

232
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,600
What's his purpose?

233
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,639
Judges,

234
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,759
it's worth considering.

235
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,279
Removing the auxiliary fuel tank

236
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,879
was to reduce the weight

237
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,559
and improve the airspeed.

238
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,080
The Hawk III Fighter was flawed itself.

239
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
It's a fighter with poor performance.

240
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,759
In several air battles, Hanguang Squadron

241
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,480
outnumbered the enemies.

242
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,840
Without Captain's modification,

243
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,799
we were no match for the Japanese planes.

244
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,080
In the 1117 battle,

245
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
we can defeat a A6M Zero

246
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,320
just because we have quick air maneuver.

247
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,600
Judge Lu, what you said

248
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,600
was not Captain's guilt but his credit.

249
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,759
All I know is that

250
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,519
according to the Wartime Discipline
of the Republic of China

251
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,720
and the Army, Navy and Air Force Penal Code,

252
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,120
the behaviour

253
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,159
is the offense of
vandalizing military equipment in wartime,

254
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,039
and it caused heavy casualty.

255
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,240
According to the law,

256
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,879
the maximum penalty

257
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,159
is the same as disobeying a military order in wartime.

258
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,639
To sum up,

259
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
in the 1117 case,

260
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,679
the defendant Zhang Qi

261
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,080
disobeyed military orders in wartime.

262
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,679
Witnesses and material evidence are confirmed.

263
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,600
Besides, since 1937,

264
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,519
he's been vandalizing our military equipment.

265
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,120
According to

266
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
the Wartime Discipline of the Republic of China

267
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,360
and the Army, Navy and Air Force Penal Code,

268
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,679
his offense has been confirmed and convicted.

269
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,320
The court will now adjourn for 20 minutes.

270
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,559
The case will be later sentenced.

271
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,600
Zhang Qi.

272
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,759
You should know well about the situation in court.

273
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,799
The offense of disobeying a military order

274
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,039
and vandalizing military equipment in wartime,

275
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,639
you can't escape from the guilt.

276
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,159
So?

277
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,159
Once convicted,

278
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,399
you'd get nothing but a bullet.

279
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,000
Look at yourself.

280
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,720
A young man of talent.

281
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,200
A brave soldier.

282
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,120
The backbone of the country.

283
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,039
And you'll die in disgrace.

284
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,039
Aren't you feeling wronged?

285
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,480
Well,

286
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,960
what I've promised you is still valid.

287
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,240
As long as you cooperate with me,

288
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,399
later in court,

289
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,279
I will find your innocence.

290
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,399
The court of the Aviation Council

291
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,720
is in the palm of your hand.

292
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,240
In other words,

293
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,159
the court of the Aviation Council

294
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,759
can be manipulated by someone like you.

295
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,919
No wonder China's airspace

296
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,799
can be occupied by the Japanese like now.

297
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,799
I know it.

298
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,200
Captain Zhang is extraordinary enough

299
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,200
to see my ability at a glance.

300
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,240
I won't call it manipulation.

301
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,359
But I do have a good idea.

302
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,119
If Captain Zhang could give back
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding to me,

303
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,119
I will definitely introduce Captain Zhang

304
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,200
into the Aviation Council.

305
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,680
Your father donated planes and roads.

306
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,480
He is universally recognized
as a patriotic businessman.

307
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,119
And you're a patriotic soldier.

308
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,359
After you entered the Aviation Council,

309
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,400
you can change the flagging atmosphere
in Chongqing.

310
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,000
Of course, I understand that

311
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,400
all you want is guarding the country.

312
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,240
But with only Hanguang Squadron,

313
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,079
how much you can do?

314
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,599
You need to go to a higher level

315
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,519
to carry out you proposition that

316
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,279
we counterattack whenever we're attacked.

317
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,160
What do you think?

318
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,400
Well, do you know that

319
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,359
except for the proposition that
we counterattack whenever we're attacked,

320
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,920
I have another proposition.

321
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,599
Tell me, please.

322
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,400
Submit only to the justice,

323
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,160
not to the situation.

324
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
Never make a deal with a wolf.

325
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,079
Great.

326
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
You do have the guts.

327
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,839
Then we'll deal with it according to the military law.

328
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,759
The 1117 case is simple and easy to judge.

329
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,519
However,

330
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,400
Zhang Qi is an air combat hero after all.

331
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,240
If we sentence him to death,

332
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,720
I'm afraid the Aviation Council will check it again.

333
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,680
Tang Shizhen won't let it go, too.

334
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,640
Take a look at this.

335
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,920
Isn't this Ding Huansheng

336
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,880
the former Vice Captain of Hanguang Squadron?

337
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,599
He...

338
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,519
He is a communist.

339
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,039
It took me three years to figure it out.

340
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,400
This man

341
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,079
have lurked in Jianqiao Aviation School since 1937.

342
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,480
We sent the Central Air Force
in our fifth siege against the Soviet area.

343
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,200
It's Ding Huangsheng who gave away secrets,

344
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,759
which enabled the first Red army

345
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,480
to get out of Shazhouba.

346
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,400
Our air force returned without any accomplishment.

347
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,119
Such a hidden spy,

348
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,880
Tang Shizhen did not find it out.

349
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,599
This one alone

350
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,240
is enough to make him speechless.

351
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,200
Besides,

352
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,640
Ding Huansheng is Zhang Qi's Vice Captain

353
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,160
and his wing man.

354
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,839
Zhang Qi himself is suspected
of colluding with the Communist Party.

355
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,559
I even doubt that

356
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,599
Zhang Qi is a communist.

357
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,039
Then,

358
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,519
he had a reason to vandalize the military aircraft.

359
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,960
To sentence such a man,

360
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,880
there's nothing to worry about.

361
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,119
We're in Kuomintang-Communist cooperation
to fight against Japan now.

362
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,720
The offense of colluding with the Communist Party

363
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,319
can't be published.

364
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,000
We don't need to publish it.

365
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,559
Time is different now, Deputy Director Shao.

366
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,319
Do you remember the Wannan Incident?

367
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,279
What Chongqing really cares is never the Japanese

368
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,759
but...

369
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,759
Director Lu is right.

370
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,960
I understand.

371
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:17,279
I believe that Deputy Director Shao

372
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,519
will try you best for the party's task.

373
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,799
Sure.

374
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,079
We're following the policy of

375
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,519
disorganizing, guarding against, restricting
and fighting against the Communist Party.

376
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,400
It is righteous to restrict the dissenting party.

377
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,559
About this case,

378
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,559
it seems that Deputy Director Shao and Director Lu

379
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,599
have made the decision.

380
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,519
Then tell me,

381
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,839
what are you going to do with Zhang Qi?

382
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,880
Sentence him according to the Wartime Discipline.

383
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,559
Supervisor Bai,

384
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,240
I know you think highly of Zhang Qi.

385
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,480
But Zhang Qi is suspected
of colluding with the Communist Party.

386
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:06,640
You'd better bear pain to sentence him.

387
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,519
Fixed barrack, floating soldiers.

388
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,680
Without Zhang Qi,

389
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,960
The Aviation Council will send

390
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,000
another excellent pilot.

391
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,599
And you?

392
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:19,599
Don't lead some suspicions to yourself.

393
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,720
You may get burned by yourself.

394
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,240
Defendant.

395
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,759
You are now allowed to make your final statement.

396
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,160
I only have one thing to say.

397
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,240
Hanguang Squadron

398
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,359
also have only one faith.

399
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,319
To counterattack whenever we're attacked.

400
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,920
To counterattack whenever we're attacked.

401
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,359
To counterattack whenever we're attacked.

402
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,519
Stand up.

403
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,680
Now, we'll sentence the 1117 case.

404
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,200
Defendants Zeng Nian Qiao and Meng Haichen.

405
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,079
The offense of disobeying a military order
in wartime is acquitted.

406
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,160
They'll be released in court.

407
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,839
Defendant Zhang Qi.

408
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,400
The offense of disobeying a military order
in wartime is convicted.

409
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,720
According to Article 27
in the Army, Navy and Air Force Penal Code,

410
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,079
Those who disobeyed the military order

411
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,240
will be sentenced to death.

412
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,359
According to Article 47 in the Penal Code,

413
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,160
Those who disobeyed a military order

414
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,160
issued by a superior authority or officer
within the scope of his function

415
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,400
should be sentenced to imprisonment
of no more than five years.

416
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:52,640
Those who commit the above crimes during wartime

417
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,200
should be sentenced
to death penalty or life imprisonment.

418
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,880
Moreover,

419
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,920
Zhang Qi's offense of vandalizing
military equipment in wartime is convicted.

420
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,920
According to the Wartime Discipline
of the Republic of China

421
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,160
and Article 48
in the Army, Navy and Air Force Penal Code,

422
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,519
he's sentenced to death penalty.

423
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,359
According to the above law,

424
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,559
the defendants will be concurrently

425
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,720
sentenced to death penalty.

426
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,680
We don't accept that. We're going to appeal.

427
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,759
During the wartime,
simplicity and efficiency is the priority.

428
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,599
I announce that

429
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,319
The defendant will be executed immediately.

430
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,359
Court adjourned.

431
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,720
Captain.

432
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,000
Captain.

433
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,279
Stop.

434
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,839
This is the instruction from Director Huang
of the Aviation Council.

435
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,880
Whatever the verdict of the 1117 case is,

436
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,000
send it back for a new trial.

437
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,799
I was wrong.

438
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,599
I'm the one who led to Poshan's death.

439
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,640
I'm the one who led to his death.

440
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,519
Everyone.

441
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,839
Because of new instructions from the Aviation Council,

442
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,559
I am hosting this informal coordination meeting.

443
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,279
Some parties concerned

444
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,799
can make an out-of-court statement
about the situation on November 17th.

445
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,519
Minister Tang, you first please.

446
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,799
On November 17th,

447
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,680
Zhang Qi took off to fight against the enemy
under my order.

448
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,759
Witnesses confirmed that

449
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:23,680
at that day, you didn't give the order to take off.

450
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,680
Here we have all the paper records.

451
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,000
They know nothing

452
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,720
about the tacit understanding of military command.

453
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,640
Lu Ziyi, I guess you don't understand it, either.

454
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,720
The tacit understanding.

455
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
What is the tacit understanding?

456
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,240
Tang Shizhen.

457
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,279
Don't play with me on words.

458
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,799
With your own words,

459
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,519
you're trying to get Zhang Qi out of guilt, right?

460
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,359
I'm the supreme military commander
in Wujiaba Airport.

461
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,799
If my word doesn't count,

462
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,039
does yours count?

463
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,119
In the 1117 battle,

464
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,079
I gave the order without following

465
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,160
Aviation Council's avoiding combat instructions.

466
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,319
And we made an agreement

467
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,920
to allow the pilots to take off.

468
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,200
Now,

469
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,039
I will present all my orders at that day.

470
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,960
And I'm responsible for all the words I said.

471
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,279
Alright.

472
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,160
Even if the takeoffs of Zhang Qi and others

473
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,400
are rightful military actions,

474
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,480
how do you explain this?

475
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,440
Ding Huansheng was suspected
of colluding with the Communist Party.

476
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,400
He was Zhang Qi's wingman.

477
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,759
We suspect that

478
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,200
Zhang Qi also has the possibility of
colluding with the Communist Party.

479
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,839
The one you protect today

480
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,359
is likely to be a communist.

481
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,359
If you keep him today,

482
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:50,279
you should know what damage
it may cause to our party in the future.

483
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,039
The so-called evidence is hearsay.

484
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,240
None is confirmed.

485
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,200
Ding Huansheng already died for the country.

486
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,599
And Zhang Qi followed me for seven years.

487
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,440
I know well whether he is a communist.

488
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,680
I devotedly served the party for 28 years.

489
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,400
I can guarantee with my life, my reputation and my future.

490
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,640
Zhang Qi is not a communist.

491
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,240
If he really is,

492
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,559
I'll shoot him first before I kill myself.

493
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,640
Guarantee.

494
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,359
It concerns the security of the party.

495
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,839
Who do you think you are to guarantee?

496
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,200
Who am I?

497
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,759
I'm the first batch of students
of the Central Military Officer School,

498
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:36,039
and Minister of the Air Force Officer School.

499
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:36,680
What?

500
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Am I not qualified to guarantee
for my student and subordinate?

501
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,000
Lu Ziyi.

502
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
Do you know why the Military Commission,

503
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,519
in recent months,

504
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,880
transferred the Fifth and the Sixth Army to Yunnan

505
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,079
and reorganized

506
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,319
more than 100,000 troops of the 66th Army

507
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,160
to enter Myanmar first recently?

508
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,119
It's to protect the Burma Road,

509
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,799
the only transportation channel in the wartime.

510
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,000
While in domestic and foreign troubles,

511
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,119
can't your Political Discipline Department

512
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,400
protect the safety of aviation
with our Education Department?

513
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,359
Ever since you came to the Aviation School,

514
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,599
you always took groundless charges

515
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,640
to arrest and insult pilots.

516
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,160
Do you really care about the security of the party?

517
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,839
Or you have ulterior motives

518
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,359
and use the power for your personal revenge.

519
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:23,480
Lu Ziyi.

520
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,799
I've asked you

521
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,480
how much the party would pay to train a good pilot.

522
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
If you keep messing around with me,

523
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,079
I won't endure you anymore.

524
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,920
I also devotedly serve the party.

525
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,680
If the party needs,

526
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,880
I won't hesitate to die for the party.

527
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,000
Keep your gun to protect yourself.

528
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,599
But you can't keep Zhang Qi.

529
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,279
Even if his crimes of disobedience
and complicity are both acquitted,

530
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,799
there will be another witness tomorrow

531
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,359
to accuse him of a heavier offense.

532
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,160
Summon the witness Zeng Mu.

533
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,480
Professor.

534
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:28,720
Professor.

535
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,680
Professor.

536
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,720
Professor.

537
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:32,759
Zhang Qi.

538
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,960
Please.

539
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,160
Sit down please, witness.

540
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,799
Witness Zeng Mu,

541
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:00,400
Professor of College of Science
and Engineering in Fuhua University.

542
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,920
The Special Technical Consultant
of the 9th Aviation Manufacturing Plant.

543
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,759
I'm going to play a recording.

544
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,200
Listen carefully.

545
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,640
Xishan is controlling the altitude

546
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,759
and flying out of the city.

547
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,759
Xishan, I order you to jump immediately.

548
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
The fuel tank is broken.

549
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,599
The wings are on fire.

550
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,559
This is the last call log of Xishan
with the tower in 428 air battle.

551
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,079
Professor Zeng.

552
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,920
Did you direct the modification of Xishan?

553
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,480
This is my son's voice.

554
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:50,799
Witness.

555
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,240
Please answer the question.

556
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,119
Did you direct it?

557
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,160
Yes.

558
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,020
Since September, 1937,

559
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,839
you've been working
in Central Aviation Manufacturing Plant

560
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,020
and the 9th Aviation Manufacturing Plant

561
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,980
as the Technical Consultant.

562
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:12,839
And you're the founder of the aerodynamics major
in Fuhua University.

563
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,640
I would like to ask you.

564
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,279
According to the recording,

565
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,759
what's your assessment of the cause of Xishan's crash?

566
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,759
Xishan has removed its auxiliary fuel tank.

567
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,079
The time it could stay in the air will be decreased.

568
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:34,480
In order to maximize the flying duration,

569
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,720
I have to raise the octane number of the fuel.

570
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,640
So,

571
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:52,160
I added alkyl lead in fuel oil.

572
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:55,119
Could you be more specific?

573
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,319
Am I not clear?

574
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,119
Illiterate.

575
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:07,920
It's the explosion-proof agent.

576
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:15,880
It's to prevent the high fuel temperature
and the engine knock.

577
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,319
But it seemed that

578
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,599
Professor Zeng's explosion-proof agent didn't work.

579
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,640
Xishan crashed precisely because of this.

580
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:32,799
Professor Zeng,

581
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:37,960
the pilot of Xishan is your son, right?

582
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,319
I'm sorry for you.

583
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,279
The crash of Xishan

584
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,519
may be related to...

585
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,480
may be related to the modification.

586
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,320
The modification of Xishan.

587
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,079
The removal of the auxiliary fuel tank.

588
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,239
Was it your idea

589
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,440
or someone's order?

590
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,239
Before the modification,

591
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:38,519
did Zhang Qi show you the approval of superiors?

592
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,239
What are you talking about?

593
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,840
You can say whatever you want.

594
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,039
Don't be afraid.

595
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,000
Lu Ziyi.

596
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,440
Don't threaten Professor Zeng.

597
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,599
I gave the order to modify the aircraft.

598
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,159
I modified the fighter myself.

599
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,239
Shut up.

600
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,519
It's not his fault.

601
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,119
Bypassed the immediate leadership
and gave orders in wartime.

602
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,360
Deceived the technical consultant.

603
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,760
Modified the aircraft without permission.

604
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,159
And finally caused the aircraft crash

605
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,760
and the death of Zeng Poshan.

606
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,400
Zhang Qi.

607
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,039
You vandalized the military equipment
on purpose during wartime.

608
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,639
That's ridiculous.

609
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Zhang Qi's design to remove the auxiliary fuel tank

610
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,079
has nothing to do with this.

611
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,760
It's me.

612
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,320
I made a mistake

613
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,000
about the ratio of alkyl lead.

614
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,679
It's my fault.

615
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,719
Please watch your words.

616
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,719
I'm telling the truth.

617
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,480
Let me ask you.

618
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,639
What does it mean

619
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,599
by vandalizing the military equipment
during wartime?

620
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,840
Anyone with a brain know that

621
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,559
it's not vandalizing but modifying.

622
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,559
The Hawk III Fighter you bought

623
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,000
is a modified version of the US Cox Company.

624
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,280
What?

625
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,480
Did the US Cox Company

626
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,760
vandalize the military equipment?

627
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,000
It's nonsense.

628
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,039
What do you do?

629
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,480
Do you understand science?

630
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,880
Do you have any idea that

631
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,800
your mistakes led to the death of Zeng Poshan?

632
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,239
The wrongful death of your son.

633
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,800
Aren't you sad about it?

634
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,760
I'm sad.

635
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,559
I am sad that there's someone like you
in the Kuomintang

636
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,639
who ignores the truth and calls white black.

637
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,880
As for my son,

638
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,199
the day he joined the army,

639
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,719
I donated him to the country.

640
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,559
As a man who devoted himself to the country,

641
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,039
he got what he wanted.

642
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,760
Why should I be sad?

643
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,880
He's also my boy.

644
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,119
His fate is the same, sooner or later.

645
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,920
I've prepared a coffin for him.

646
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,079
A man like you

647
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,599
is unworthy of comparison with him.

648
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,440
Shameless.

649
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:34,440
A wretched man.

650
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Crazy old man!

651
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,119
Get him out of here.

652
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,199
Professor.

653
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:40,679
What?

654
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,840
Are you afraid of what I said?

655
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:43,760
Professor.

656
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,039
Let me go.

657
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,559
He's about to die very soon.

658
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,920
Who are you to judge him?

659
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,079
A crafty sycophant in power.

660
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,559
There's a wretched man like you in Kuomintang.

661
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,000
It's bound to be defeated.

662
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,840
How did Yuan Chonghuan die?

663
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,039
How did the Ming Dynasty perish?

664
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,079
I respect you as a scholar.
