[Defying the Storm]

3
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,780
[Episode 05]

4
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,400
This...

5
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,719
Where's this bombing?

6
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:48,879
In the south.

7
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,799
Don't be too alarmed, everyone.

8
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,879
Secretary General Meng,

9
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,920
the decision to move the University south immediately

10
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,000
is too hasty.

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,519
The government is urging us to the south.

12
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,200
But we have thousands of students and teachers.

13
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,120
Besides, the Japanese kept bombing until now,

14
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,040
but they didn't break in the city.

15
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,879
As long as we don't act like Zhao Dengyu

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,439
and fight against them,

17
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,759
the Japanese won't show no decency.

18
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,719
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,479
Commander Zhao devoted himself to the country.

20
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,400
He's prepared to fight until death for Peiping.

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,360
And you're expecting that

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,960
the invaders to show some decency?

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,800
Soldiers.

24
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,360
It's their duty to fight for the country.

25
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,240
Right.

26
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,599
It's soldiers' duty to fight for the country.

27
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,039
So please tell me,

28
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,800
everyone,

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,280
what about our duty?

30
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,120
The Japanese don't come as guests

31
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
and leave after the feast.

32
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,439
We're facing the annihilation of our country.

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
What is annihilation?

34
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,080
The first to annihilate is your spirit.

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,280
The second to annihilate is your body.

36
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,680
Everyone here is well-educated.

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,360
There were so many wars of genocide in history.

38
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,520
In which one can our scholars keep ourselves safe?

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Everyone, don't be so naive

40
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,759
to believe that the Japanese could let us

41
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,479
study and educate safely.

42
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,639
Unless,

43
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,719
you teach your students the Japanese courses.

44
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,840
Then, President Zhou,

45
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,639
what's your opinion?

46
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,800
I know.

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,479
Some of you would call me a capitulaitonist.

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,680
In fact, there's also heroism in my heart.

49
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,000
But,

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
to ensure the safety of teachers and students

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,719
is my duty.

52
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,039
In such a chaotic time,

53
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,400
I just expect that

54
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,599
we can earn as much evacuation time as possible.

55
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,879
I have agreed to the Japanese scholar

56
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,159
Okayama Shinichi's request

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,039
to have cultural exchange.

58
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,639
Ask Professor Ling Wenyue

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,039
to add a lecture

60
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,159
about the integration
of Chinese and Japanese culture.

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,439
We need to show some friendly gestures

62
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,160
to get the chance to evacuate safely.

63
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,240
President Zhou.

64
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
I don't think it's appropriate.

65
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,000
Based on what I know about Professor Ling,

66
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,360
he won't give the lecture.

67
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,279
Having this lecture

68
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,879
is to create a great atmosphere

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,639
and buy us time.

70
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,120
Only by this

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,920
can we get well-prepared for moving south.

72
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,680
What's the big hurry?

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,120
President.

74
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,079
Yanxi University

75
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,319
was bombed by the Japanese.

76
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,959
The classrooms, the library

77
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,639
and the dormitory, they're all destroyed.

78
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,680
The university's clock was also taken
by the Japanese.

79
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,360
They said they would melt it down for making bullets.

80
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,480
Wuran.

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,759
Please do ask Wenyue to add this lecture tonight.

82
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,399
This is about saving the university.

83
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,639
The southward migration of the university.

84
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,439
We need to prepare from now on.

85
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,480
President Zhou.

86
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,480
Everyone.

87
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,800
Tonight's lecture,

88
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I'll handle it.

89
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,360
Haitang.

90
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
The Japanese army attacked Peiping.

91
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
I can't promise you and Haichen

92
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,480
a safe return to home.

93
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,000
Go back to Hangzhou with me.

94
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,720
What?

95
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,319
Japanese bombers are arriving.

96
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,519
And Haichen needs treatment.

97
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,160
We have medics on board.

98
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,279
Don't return home.

99
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,199
It's too dangerous.

100
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,079
No.

101
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,560
You can leave with Haichen. I'll go home.

102
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,920
Okay.

103
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,879
Zhang Qi.

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,600
Officer Li.

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,120
Take him on board.

106
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,879
Yes.

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,959
Bring him up. Easy.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,959
Wake up, buddy.

109
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,439
Can you hear me?

110
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,680
Hang in there.

111
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,160
We'll get to the hospital soon.

112
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:40,720
Let's go.

113
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,439
031 2214.

114
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,240
When it takes off,

115
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,759
evacuate the airport personnel
and carry out the bombing plan.

116
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,319
I'm going to Qinghe Airport

117
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,279
and fly 024 back.

118
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:53,920
May you fly safe.

119
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,480
Okay.

120
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,120
Ding.

121
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Won't he go to Hangzhou with you?

122
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,519
Captain has a mission.

123
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,519
Miss Meng, go home.

124
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
Everyone, go!

125
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,199
Aiming at the hangar.

126
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,040
Bomb.

127
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,160
Speak louder. I can't hear you.

128
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,759
The Fuxing at Nanyuan Airport was bombed.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,600
That's fine. All the evidences are gone with that.

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,399
Director.

131
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,600
Two boxes of cargo on board in Qinghe.

132
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,399
and those in the warehouse, what to do with them?

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,439
Okayama, that geezer

134
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,000
changed his mind after Lugou Bridge Incident.

135
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,639
Instead of trading in Hangzhou,

136
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,000
he wants to trade in Peiping.

137
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,959
Go to Qinghe these days

138
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,000
to deal with the cargo.

139
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,639
In the morning of the day after tomorrow,

140
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,399
go there to trade.

141
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,360
I promise to fulfill the mission this time.

142
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
Meng.

143
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:36,918
Hurry.

144
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,600
Haitang.

145
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,960
Where's your brother?

146
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,080
It's all my fault.

147
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
I didn't took good care of Haichen.

148
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,679
He went to Hangzhou with Zhang Qi.

149
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
I should have told you that

150
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,120
he joined the army.

151
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,480
We were too headstrong.

152
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
What shall we do?

153
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,840
Alright.

154
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,240
It's okay.

155
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,559
Don't worry.

156
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,360
Listen to me.

157
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:18,879
My daughter.

158
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,600
You and your brother are both grown up.

159
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,559
You should face the world and brave the storm.

160
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
It was good that he went with Zhang Qi.

161
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,399
At least,

162
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
we know where he is.

163
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,000
And he had people to look after him.

164
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,440
Don't worry about that right now.

165
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,559
Your mission now

166
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,279
is packing up luggage at home with your mom.

167
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,759
Don't bring too much.

168
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,639
Take only what is necessary.

169
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,480
Soon we will go south to Hangzhou.

170
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,200
Then,

171
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,279
you can go find Haichen.

172
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,559
We are going to Hangzhou, too?

173
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:48,960
Right.

174
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,279
Well, what about our house?

175
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,720
We need someone to take care of it.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
Can we bring the cat?

177
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,480
You said right now.

178
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,120
What should we bring?

179
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,080
And what should we leave?

180
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,919
I just bought a cloth for Haitang

181
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,200
to make her a new dress.

182
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,320
We should take it.

183
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,200
Meng.

184
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,799
Your favorite tea sets.

185
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,960
Take!

186
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,360
Take them all.

187
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,279
Remember, Haitang.

188
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,240
If I don't return tomorrow,

189
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,919
when you arrive in Hangzhou,

190
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,000
take good care of mother

191
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,360
and find your brother back.

192
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,080
Won't you come with us?

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,960
Dad will go to Uncle Ling's house.

194
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,559
It's a huge thing.

195
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,440
If,

196
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,960
I can't catch up with you.

197
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,600
Ling and I will meet you in Hangzhou.

198
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,279
You haven't eaten for two meals.

199
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,200
Have dinner before you go.

200
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,000
Why don't you know what's important all the time?

201
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,080
All you know is to eat.

202
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,679
Eat!

203
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,279
It's been seven years.

204
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,519
Wuran.

205
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:47,960
The secret.

206
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,480
I've never told you about it.

207
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,480
Because tonight,

208
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,480
I'm going to give that lecture.

209
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,320
If I could not come back,

210
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,080
it's impossible for Lanshan alone

211
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,000
to finish the big task Professor Jin left her.

212
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,600
So I have to say.

213
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,360
Seven years ago,

214
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,320
Professor Jin, Lanshan and I

215
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,519
found a huge oracle bone
engraved with inscriptions in Xiaotun, Anyang.

216
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,559
We deduced that

217
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,679
the oracle bone

218
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,039
was from the time of King Wu Ding,
the 22nd emperor of the Shang Dynasty.

219
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,000
Oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

220
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,879
The oracle bone is unique

221
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,000
because it's not only big

222
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,279
but also engraved with

223
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,159
different names of the diviners.

224
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,639
There are six names.

225
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,799
According to the time the diviners lived,

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,159
we could deduce the Calendar of Yin.

227
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,399
The oracle bone is too important.

228
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,159
It can take us back to more than 3,000 years ago.

229
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,879
Wenyue.

230
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,399
The Japanese right wing has been skeptical

231
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,440
about the existence of our history of Shang Dynasty.

232
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,799
As you just said, the message

233
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,519
that oracle bone conveys

234
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,440
is precisely

235
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,960
a proof of the existence of this period of history.

236
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,360
It's of high academic value.

237
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,279
So,

238
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,159
as soon as we found it,

239
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,320
the Japanese focused on it right away.

240
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,000
I have an agreement with Professor Jin.

241
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,720
He kept the original bone.

242
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,360
And he only gave me a rubbing

243
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,799
for academic research.

244
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,799
But as time went by,

245
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,039
I also found a problem.

246
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,000
A rubbing is a rubbing after all.

247
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,919
The detailed carvings of

248
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,399
Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches

249
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,399
were all blurred.

250
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,519
Extremely small scratches are also not clear.

251
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,919
So,

252
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,399
by the time I finish and publish my book,

253
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
there must be the original oracle bone

254
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,279
or a more detailed and accurate rubbing

255
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,879
as a proof.

256
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
You mean,

257
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,399
before Professor Jin left,

258
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,120
he didn't leave the oracle bone to you.

259
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
No.

260
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,600
I thought it was very strange.

261
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,440
I joined an academic seminar

262
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,759
of a Japanese scholar, Okayama Shinichi.

263
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,200
At the seminar, he said that

264
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Professor Jin gave
the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding to him.

265
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,960
He'll present the original bone in a month.

266
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,000
Of course I won't believe his words.

267
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,759
But what he said,

268
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,759
isn't it odd?

269
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,759
Professor Jin will never do something like that.

270
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,279
He said that to you.

271
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,519
Wenyue.

272
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,960
Did Okayama target you?

273
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,759
At that time,

274
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,480
I didn't think much of it.

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,320
But now, I think

276
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
he invited me to the seminar

277
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,919
just trying to get some information

278
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,679
about oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding from me.

279
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,480
But I don't have any clue of it.

280
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,360
If oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding are lost,

281
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,200
I can't escape from the guilt.

282
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,320
I'm telling you this now

283
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,720
and getting you involved.

284
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,240
So I hope that

285
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,000
you can help us to find the oracle bone back.

286
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:55,799
Wenyue.

287
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,399
What do you mean by getting me involved?

288
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,559
The cultural vein of our nation

289
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,759
is the vein of ourselves.

290
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,720
You and Professor Jin

291
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
have been shouldering it for seven years.

292
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,480
Today, you told me such a big issue.

293
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,840
It's my pleasure.

294
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,799
I have made a plan.

295
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,799
I wanted to go to

296
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,919
Nanjing Institute of History and Philology,

297
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,799
and make a copy

298
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,519
of all rubbings of tortoise shells in there

299
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,320
for academic research.

300
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,039
But tonight,

301
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,039
after this lecture,

302
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,919
I don't know if I could come back.

303
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,799
In case I don't make it back,

304
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,360
well,

305
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,559
the secret of oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

306
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,600
and my family,

307
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,279
Lanshan, and Qianying,

308
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,120
I can only entrust them to you.

309
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,360
That's enough.

310
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,080
I understand.

311
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,720
Wenyue.

312
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,399
If you want me to help you find the oracle bone,

313
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,919
can you let me see the rubbing of it?

314
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,960
It's here. Follow me.

315
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,399
Meng Wuran.

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Meng Wuran.

317
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,159
Why do you lock me in?

318
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Open the door.

319
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,600
Wenyue.

320
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,120
Today, you just stay home.

321
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,440
Don't care about anything else.

322
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,720
Open the door and let me out.

323
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,840
Meng.

324
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,360
Okayama came for me.

325
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,440
It is useless for you to go.

326
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,279
If you go to give the lecture today,

327
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,200
can you bend down?

328
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,039
If you can't,

329
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,440
it means death.

330
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,600
I can't bend down.

331
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,159
But can you?

332
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,879
I've been bending down so many times these years.

333
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
I don't care about one more time.

334
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,799
Meng Wuran.

335
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,080
Wenyue.

336
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,679
The oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

337
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,879
and the family of yours and mine,

338
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,480
All the messes,

339
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,279
I'll leave them to you.

340
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,759
Come back.

341
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,879
Open the door.

342
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,159
Dad.

343
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,120
What are you doing here?

344
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,759
Mom asked me to bring you noodles.

345
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,840
It looks like it's all messed up.

346
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,159
Go home.

347
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,559
Meng Wuran.

348
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,360
Meng Wuran.

349
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,720
Meng.

350
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:24,720
Professor Kang.

351
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,000
What are you doing?

352
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,399
Go home first, Haitang.

353
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,320
I'll go back soon.

354
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,240
Professor Kang.

355
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm ordering as Dean of School of Chinese Studies
in Fuhua University.

356
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,759
Take care of him today.

357
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,919
Don't let him go anywhere.

358
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,480
Professor Kang.

359
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,039
You are a sensible woman.

360
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,039
You should know that

361
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,440
only Wenyue can finish

362
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
the book, Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

363
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,639
Do you know what I mean?

364
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,039
I do.

365
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,480
You're right.

366
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,639
Great.

367
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,559
Tomorrow.

368
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,200
Professor Zeng will go to Hangzhou.

369
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,759
Your family take my wife and Haitang to go with him.

370
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,759
Then who will give the lecture tonight?

371
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,000
I am also a professor at Fuhua University.

372
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,839
Tonight's lecture will be given by me.

373
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,200
Mom.

374
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,680
Meng Wuran

375
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,319
is writing now with the will to die.

376
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,039
He's going back to the podium.

377
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,240
He will face to the invaders directly.

378
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,440
He wants to protect the pillars of the country
like Ling Wenyue.

379
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,359
He will use his bent frame

380
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
to write the toughness of a scholar.

381
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,200
Meng!

382
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,000
Anyone here?

383
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,079
Who's outside?

384
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,480
Open the door.

385
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:39,960
Qianying.

386
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,400
Is it you, Qianying?

387
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,839
Dad, it's me.

388
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,319
Has Uncle Meng left yet, Qianying?

389
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,920
He's left.

390
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,200
Qianying.

391
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,359
Here's the thing.

392
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,559
Tonight's lecture should be given by dad.

393
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,559
But Uncle Meng is going instead of me.

394
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,440
It means that

395
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,640
the danger that should be taken by me

396
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,240
is taken by Uncle Meng instead.

397
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,079
Do you understand?

398
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,440
Dad, but I don't want you to go.

399
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't want you to die.

400
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,720
Qianying.

401
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,240
You think dad will die, don't you?

402
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:05,480
Yes.

403
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,119
But Uncle Meng went there now.

404
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,119
He'll also die.

405
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:08,880
Do you understand?

406
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,599
Our own danger.

407
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,359
We can't let anyone else take it for us.

408
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,640
That's the simplest thing.

409
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Do you understand, Qianying?

410
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,119
Qianying, listen to me.

411
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,279
Ask mom to get the keys.

412
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,240
Open the door.

413
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,039
Come on, hurry.

414
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,640
Mom.

415
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,200
Lanshan.

416
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,559
You're outside, Lanshan.

417
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,039
Lanshan, why are you so unreasonable?

418
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,279
The lecture is mine.

419
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,759
We can't let anyone else take the disaster for us.

420
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you understand?

421
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,359
If something happens to Meng today,

422
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,880
how should we live on?

423
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,400
You know what I am.

424
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,720
If today, something happens to him,

425
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,440
how am I supposed to live?

426
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,400
What would I do with the rest of my life?

427
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,079
Lanshan,

428
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,119
open the door.

429
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,039
Open the door.

430
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,240
Lanshan, hurry up.

431
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,000
Lanshan, hurry up.

432
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,160
Lanshan.

433
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,640
There's still some time for me to go there.

434
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,599
I know.

435
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,319
For Nanjing Institute of History and Philology,

436
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,680
I'll go to rub the oracle bone myself.

437
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,440
Okay.

438
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:31,839
Lanshan.

439
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,440
You know me.

440
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,359
I have to go to give the lecture today.

441
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,720
Dad.

442
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,160
Qianying.

443
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,000
Remember.

444
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,759
A man should have a pure heart.

445
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,640
Tonight,

446
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,000
no matter what happens,

447
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,160
listen to your mother.

448
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,279
Qianying.

449
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,240
Qianying.

450
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:14,920
Mom.

451
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,759
He is a man

452
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,079
who puts his innocence before his own life.

453
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,119
Uncle Chen.

454
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,119
Haitang.

455
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,599
Today's lecture.

456
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,759
Do you know where it is?

457
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:22,720
Mr. Ling's lecture?

458
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:22,960
Yes.

459
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,839
I'm on my way to it.

460
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,440
Come with me.

461
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay.

462
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,319
Excuse me.

463
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,960
Where's Mr. Ling Wenyue?

464
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm Dean of School of Chinese Studies

465
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,119
in Fuhua University.

466
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,000
Professor Ling's lecture today

467
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
will be given by me.

468
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,119
You idiot.

469
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,720
Mr. Ando.

470
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,400
Don't be mad.

471
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,240
Since we're here to listen,

472
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,960
let's just listen Dean Meng's lecture.

473
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,860
[China-Japanese Cultural Integration Conference]

474
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,599
Students.

475
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Excuse me.

476
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm Ling Wenyue.

477
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,119
This is my lecture.

478
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,359
Yes.

479
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,799
Students.

480
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,559
The class begins.

481
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,960
Sit down, please.

482
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,079
This word.

483
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,480
I think you all recognize it.

484
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,880
How to read it?

485
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,799
Ri.

486
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,039
Right.

487
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,000
This is our Chinese pronunciation.

488
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,000
The word is also in Japanese.

489
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,640
They read it as,

490
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,200
nichi,

491
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,480
or, hi.

492
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,319
But no matter how to read it,

493
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,000
its meaning has not changed.

494
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,680
Ri,

495
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,599
it means the sun.

496
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,200
Students.

497
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,680
Japan is a country that worships the sun.

498
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,400
It lies to the east of China.

499
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,240
Compared to China,

500
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,720
the Japanese can see the sun rise earlier.

501
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,359
What I want to share with you today

502
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,200
is that how it develops

503
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,440
from the hieroglyphic inscriptions on oracle bones

504
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,720
to today.

505
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,400
Everybody, watch it.

506
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,240
This is...

507
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,680
Running script. Ri.

508
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,519
Cursive script. Ri.

509
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,279
Regular script. Ri.

510
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,759
Official script. Ri.

511
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,880
Seal script. Ri.

512
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,759
The last two

513
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,440
are Bronze inscriptions
and Oracle Bone script.

514
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,759
This is Bronze inscription.

515
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:13,759
Ri.

516
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,519
The last one.

517
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,160
Oracle Bone script. Ri.

518
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,920
Students.

519
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,319
If there were a time train

520
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,640
rushing back along the history.

521
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,680
When this train stop at Xiaotun, Anyang,

522
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,039
you will find that

523
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,960
the Chinese characters you write today

524
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
all originated here.

525
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:47,839
Because this is

526
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,160
the birthplace of Oracle Bone script.

527
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,519
Including the word I just talked about, Ri.

528
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,880
Students.

529
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,319
Now,

530
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,160
I'm going to draw you a map.

531
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,880
This is a map of the Southern Song Dynasty.

532
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,880
Please pay attention to here.

533
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,440
Guangdong province today.

534
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,240
Here.

535
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,039
It's called Yashan.

536
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:47,880
Here.

537
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,799
The city on the southern bank
of the lower Yangtze River.

538
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:52,839
It's called Jiangyin.

539
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,720
Why do I want to tell you this today?

540
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,160
I want to tell you.

541
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,240
Geography is history.

542
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,480
History is character.

543
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,000
If we use the shortest Chinese words

544
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,119
to record a man's life,

545
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,319
I would write it like this.

546
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,519
Lu Xiufu was born in Yancheng,

547
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,079
buried in Yashan.

548
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,079
One hundred thousand Jiangyin citizens,

549
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
born in Jiangyin,

550
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,759
buried in Jiangyin.

551
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,519
Alright,

552
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,079
let me ask you a question.

553
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,440
Where were you born?

554
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,119
Where will you be buried?

555
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,799
Chinese

556
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,759
is the most beautiful language in the world.

557
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
It's full of warmth.

558
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,480
It represents a pictographic meaning.

559
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,799
It has profound connotations.

560
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,400
The most important thing is that

561
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,640
Chinese character

562
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,519
is a language passing on

563
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,160
for more than three thousand years

564
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,119
without any interruption.

565
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,400
Maybe you'd ask.

566
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,119
Is that important?

567
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,119
Meng Haitang.

568
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,839
You've asked the same question before.

569
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:31,880
Right?

570
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,519
Yes, Mr. Ling.

571
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
I'll answer again.

572
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,720
Sure it's important.

573
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,799
If you don't understand

574
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,680
the characters from one hundred years

575
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,640
to four hundred years ago,

576
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:45,839
Cao Fangting,

577
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,880
you won't be punished by the teacher

578
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
for reading Dream of Red Mansions.

579
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,160
He Dingjun.

580
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,400
Your favorite Journey to the West,

581
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,119
there's no need to read it.

582
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,400
Because you can't understand it.

583
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,519
If you don't understand

584
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,960
the characters over a thousand years ago,

585
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,039
Preface to Tengwang Pavillion,

586
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:07,960
students from the Chinese department

587
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,200
don't have to recite it anymore.

588
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,599
Because the magnificent scenes in early Tang dynasty

589
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,559
and the majestic views
in the flourishing Tang dynasty

590
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,759
won't be understood by you.

591
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,160
Then let's talk about

592
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,640
the characters two thousand years ago.

593
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,799
The characters two thousand years ago,

594
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,799
if you don't understand it.

595
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,359
For students in the history department,

596
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:23,880
Records of the Historian,

597
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,359
you can burn it right away.

598
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,680
Why?

599
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,559
Because of the story of Jing Ke stabbing King Qin,

600
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,079
the Bright Moon of Qin dynasty,

601
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,720
the fight with one's back to the river,

602
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,960
breaking the caldrons and sinking the boats,

603
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,920
and because of

604
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,559
King Goujian's sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall.

605
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
You would understand none of them!

606
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:42,960
If so,

607
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,160
what a pity it is!

608
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,279
The ground beneath our feet.

609
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,039
Li Bai has been here.

610
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,720
Where Huo Qubing went,

611
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,079
we can also reach.

612
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,799
Why?

613
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,039
Because our culture

614
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,240
and our characters

615
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,319
have always been continuous.

616
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,799
So you can read.

617
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,759
You can see the smoke in the desert.

618
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,599
You can see the spring rain in Jiangnan.

619
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,279
You can hear about

620
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,440
the literati with dignity and the heroes with swords.

621
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,119
Now, you can understand

622
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,759
the meaning of the saying, when the culture exist,

623
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:22,960
China will never be annihilated.

624
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,599
I want to teach you two more characters.

625
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,839
These two characters.

626
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Do you understand?

627
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,720
You don't.

628
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
But I don't blame you.

629
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,039
Because it's Oracle Bone script.

630
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,960
Our earliest hieroglyphs.

631
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,000
The central land guarded by the waving flags.

632
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,200
And,

633
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,960
a man with a crown guarded by weapons.

634
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,599
What exactly are these characters?

635
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,960
Now,

636
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,720
I'll rewrite it in modern writing.

637
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,359
See, do you understand?

638
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,200
Right.

639
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,960
The two words mean China.

640
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,000
This is our homeland.

641
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,319
This is

642
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:05,880
our motherland.

643
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,799
I just asked you a question.

644
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,720
I'm the teacher.

645
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,920
I should answer it first.

646
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,160
I,

647
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,839
Ling Wenyue,

648
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,799
was born in Lanling

649
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,119
and will be buried in China.

650
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:29,359
I am not afraid of death.

651
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,400
You idiot.

652
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,759
Mr. Ando.

653
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,279
I, Meng Haitang,

654
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,920
was born in Peiping and will be buried in China.

655
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,920
I am not afraid of death.

656
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,720
I,

657
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,279
Chen Dairong,

658
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,680
was born in Tianjin and will be buried in China.

659
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,319
I am not afraid of death.

660
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,640
I, Liang Kaiyuan,

661
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,759
was born in Changsha and will be buried in China.

662
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,599
I am not afraid of death.

663
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:05,079
I, Huang Dunyu,

664
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,119
was born in Tieling and will be buried in China.

665
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,159
I am not afraid of death.

666
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:09,879
I, He Dingjun,

667
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,360
was born in Baoding and will be buried in China.

668
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,599
I am not afraid of death.

669
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,679
Shut up.

670
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,920
It's none of their business.

671
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,079
I can go with you.

672
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,639
The guard in Qinghe

673
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,719
is just an empty shell.

674
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,760
The planes and the pilots

675
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,719
have all been transferred.

676
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,800
Even the guard troops

677
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,840
have all been transferred to Nanyuan.

678
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,000
It's just you and me left now.

679
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,159
What do you worry about?

680
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,960
We've been told that

681
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,960
after refueling the plane,

682
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,559
at 8:45 p.m,

683
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,559
Central Aviation School will send men

684
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,400
to take over the plane.

685
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,559
Who are you?

686
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,800
We're from the Central Aviation School.

687
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,559
We're ordered to check the 024 plane again.

688
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,679
You can leave now.

689
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,159
We'll take care of here.

690
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,039
What?

691
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
The order is ahead of schedule.

692
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,440
Which of you is the pilot to take over the plane?

693
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:11,800
How did we not know about this?

694
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,639
Crack the bottom and unload the cargo, hurry.

695
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:15,920
Yes.

696
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,559
Hurry up.

697
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,519
Get inside.

698
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,400
What? Did you find it?

699
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,039
Report.

700
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,079
Manager Xu.

701
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,199
There's a car on the way here.

702
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:48,679
It might be

703
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,679
the pilot to take over the plane.

704
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,840
What? He comes so early?

705
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,880
What's the smell?

706
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,039
Take the boxes and get out now.

707
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,519
Hurry.

708
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,360
Go.

709
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,960
Hurry up.

710
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,119
Put in the car, hurry.

711
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,039
Manager Xu.

712
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,280
What about these cargo?

713
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,320
Deputy Director Lu asked to deliver them

714
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,239
to Tongmao Antique Shop.

715
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:04,639
The morning after tomorrow,

716
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,480
deliver them to Zhengyang Gate.

717
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,960
Go.

718
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,239
Mr. Ling.

719
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,360
Father.

720
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,800
Secretary General Meng.

721
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:43,840
May I have a word with you?

722
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,000
Mr. Okayama.

723
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,920
You have no right to arrest people casually.

724
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,199
Professor Ling Wenyue is

725
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,400
Fuhua University's professor.

726
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,400
He's a famous scholar in China.

727
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,480
I need you to release him right now.

728
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,239
Otherwise,

729
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,159
tomorrow, newspapers all over the world

730
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
will report how you Japanese soldiers

731
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,760
persecute we Chinese scholars.

732
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,800
Secretary General Meng.

733
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,920
I'm afraid tomorrow there will be

734
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,599
more shocking news for the world.

735
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,039
What happens here,

736
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,639
I'm afraid only you and I can solve it.

737
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:18,760
I believe that

738
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,440
Mr. Meng must know which way the wind blows.

739
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,920
What do you mean?

740
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,519
What do you want exactly?

741
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:27,840
Here's the thing.

742
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,639
There's a precious piece of

743
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,480
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

744
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,679
Jin Zhilie, Mr. Jin of your university,

745
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,199
has promised to give it to me

746
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,320
to bring back to Japan for safekeeping.

747
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,079
But I never got the chance to come to China.

748
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,960
Now, I'm here

749
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:42,119
only to hear that he died suddenly.

750
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,119
Secretary General Meng.

751
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:46,679
It is obvious that there is a conspiracy.

752
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,840
Someone must have stolen it.

753
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,599
You and Mr. Ling are old friends.

754
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,159
You're the most important person to him.

755
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,960
I'm sure you'll remember

756
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,719
where the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding are.

757
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,000
Mr. Meng.

758
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,519
I'm not one of those roughnecks.

759
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,599
I hope you can remind Mr. Ling

760
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,599
of giving it to me.

761
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:05,960
But,

762
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,920
the oracle bone

763
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,360
is not in Mr. Ling's hand.

764
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,360
It seems that Mr. Meng knows more

765
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,400
about the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding
than I thought.

766
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,559
It's not in Ling Wenyue's hand.

767
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,760
Well, Mr Meng, you must know where it is.

768
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,400
How could I know?

769
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,199
I didn't know the existence of it before.

770
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,599
Mr. Meng.

771
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,599
I'm not a patient person.

772
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,519
Well,

773
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,320
I'll take Ling Wenyue first.

774
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,000
I'll have a good conversation with him.

775
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,239
You...

776
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,519
I'll give you one day to recall it carefully.

777
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,559
In a day,

778
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,119
if you can give the oracle bone inscriptions
of Wuding back to me,

779
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,559
I'll ask the Great Japanese Imperial Army

780
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,360
to release Mr. Ling.

781
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,960
You have my word.

782
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,360
Mr. Okayama.

783
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,000
Such a precious object.

784
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,800
How can I find it in a day?

785
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,480
You are making it difficult for me.

786
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,079
Peiping's prison

787
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:06,039
is taken over by the Japanese Military Police now.

788
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,000
Captain Ando is a soldier.

789
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
He has heavy hands.

790
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,599
Let's do it this way.

791
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,519
You release Mr. Ling Wenyue.

792
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,920
And we can find it together.

793
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,840
It might be faster.

794
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,599
Mr. Meng.

795
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,960
You don't have the right to bargain now.

796
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,559
When the sun rises the day after tomorrow,

797
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,800
meet me at Zhengyang Gate.

798
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:28,159
If you're late,

799
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,800
I'm afraid you'll never see Mr. Ling again.

800
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,239
By the way,

801
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,559
Mr. Meng,

802
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,360
let me give you one more piece of advice.

803
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,559
I hope Mr. Meng

804
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,719
is an honest man.

805
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,480
Sure you will give me the real

806
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,440
the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding, right?

807
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,400
Goodbye.

808
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,280
Father.
