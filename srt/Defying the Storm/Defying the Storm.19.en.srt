This Zhong means "middle",

as well as the "Zhong" in China,

10

not the Zhong that means "terminate".

When Zujia was practicing divination,

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,279
We'll be responsible for your future life,

342
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,519
just like the tradition in Jianqiao.

343
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,119
What's the tradition?

344
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,119
Ding left nothing in his entire life.

345
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,440
This is the only thing that he left.

346
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,559
This is a commemorative coin.

347
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,759
It used to have two sides,

348
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,759
but he changed it to one side.

349
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,200
I think,

350
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,359
to save the country by aviation,

351
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,759
is what he wants in his life.

352
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:29,359
Will the government admit
that Chunlai sacrificed for the country?

353
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:30,880
Yes.

354
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,440
After the air battle on 14th, August,

355
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,119
Mr. Mao Zedong issued an article.

356
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,559
He wrote, all front-line troops,

357
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,839
whether it's army, air force or local forces,

358
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,200
they all fought bravely.

359
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,839
This reflects the heroic spirit
of our Chinese nation.

360
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,519
With supreme enthusiasm,

361
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,720
CPC would like to extend

362
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,319
the salute of national revolution

363
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,319
to all patriotic compatriots
and patriotic troops in the country.

364
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,880
The salute of national revolution?

365
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,359
Yes.

366
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:10,720
Good.

367
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,079
Good.

368
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,160
It's a worthy death for Chunlai.

369
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,759
Please help me

370
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,200
to fulfill Chunlai's last wish.

371
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,480
Don't.

372
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,039
I wasn't blaming you.

373
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,319
Stand up.

374
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,279
Aunt, please sit down.

375
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,519
This is our rule.

376
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,319
There will be sacrifices in war.

377
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,160
I won't blame you.

378
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,200
Chunlai is my wingman.

379
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,839
I took him to the sky,

380
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,200
but I didn't let him land safely.

381
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,119
He was my best brother when he was alive,

382
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,480
as well as my guide.

383
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,839
Now he has sacrificed.

384
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,359
I'll regard his mother as my mother.

385
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,559
I'll treat you

386
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,839
in the same filial way as he will.

387
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,960
My mom died when I was little.

388
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,359
I haven't called mom for a long time.

389
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,160
Are you willing

390
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,960
to let me call you mom?

391
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,519
Stand up.

392
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,319
Just stand up.

393
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,400
Mom.

394
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,319
Minster allowed me to stay with Mom
in Shang Village for three days.

395
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,319
You can go back to Wujiaba first.

396
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,480
Okay, I'll pick you up after three days.

397
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:37,640
Take care of yourself.

398
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,720
Yantai! Yantai!

399
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,599
Yantai!

400
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,119
Yantai!

401
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,200
Yantai!

402
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,599
Yantai!

403
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,559
Yantai!

404
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,599
Yantai! Yantai!

405
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:17,599
Yantai! Yantai!

406
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,720
Did anything happen?

407
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,319
Mom.

408
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,440
Don't worry, I'll go and check it.

409
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,079
Yantai! Yantai!

410
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:35,000
Yantai! Yantai!

411
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:43,480
Yantai! Yantai!

412
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,039
They are heading to Fuhua University.

413
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,359
Fuhua University?

414
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,799
When I was looking for you,

415
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,440
I wandered around here for a long time,

416
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,880
so I know that's Fuhua University.

417
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,039
They also came from Hangzhou.

418
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,400
I heard

419
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,200
the teachers and students from Peiping
are not getting alone well with the locals.

420
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,359
I'm afraid anything would happen.

421
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,079
Calm down, calm down.

422
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,319
Please calm down.

423
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,160
Calm down.

424
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Please calm down.

425
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
[Fuhua University]

426
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,000
Calm down, calm down.

427
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,720
Please calm down, okay?

428
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,640
Tell us, where are you hiding the kid?

429
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,759
Your kid is not in our campus.

430
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:27,400
Impossible.

431
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,559
Brother, Yantai must be in there.

432
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,480
Or, they have eaten him.

433
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,400
We need to get in.

434
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,160
Where is Yantai?

435
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Give us the kid.

436
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,759
Or we will burn this school.

437
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,279
- Burn this school!
- Burn this school!

438
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,200
Villagers, villagers.

439
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Take care of those antiques.

440
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,519
I'll explain to them.

441
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,400
Be careful.

442
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,279
Just go.

443
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,799
Everything has a reason, right?

444
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,079
Yes, you need to be reasonable.

445
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,359
What's your reason?

446
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,039
You tell me your reasons.

447
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,279
Follow that woman.

448
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,759
Come on.

449
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,680
Go.

450
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,279
When I was delivering the meal for you,

451
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
I saw you holding a skull.

452
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,880
It's you.

453
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,119
What's that?

454
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,400
Please let me explain to you.

455
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,519
The skull I was holding is not a human's skull.

456
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,400
That's a fossil of an ape.

457
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,480
It has been preserved for eight million years.

458
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,920
Eight million years?

459
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,000
Are you kidding me?

460
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,559
That's right.

461
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:31,720
Think about it.

462
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,759
Is there a huge difference

463
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:36,759
between the skull I was holding
and the human skull now?

464
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,319
That skull's eyebrow bones
are very broad and protruding.

465
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,200
Its nose is flat.

466
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,359
Its jaws are also very protruding.

467
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,039
And it doesn't have a lower jaw.

468
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,279
How could this be the skull of a human?

469
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:48,400
That's right.

470
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,359
That's the fossil of an ancient ape,

471
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,359
not the human's skull.

472
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
It's a stone.

473
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,680
Yes, that's a stone.

474
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,960
We don't understand what you said.

475
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,039
- Give us the kid.
- Give us the kid!

476
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,319
- Give us the kid!
- Give us the kid!

477
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,160
Calm down!

478
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,839
Supervisor Bai.

479
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,880
Supervisor Bai, you need to uphold justice for us.

480
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,680
These are bad people.

481
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,079
It's midnight now.

482
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,000
Who are making trouble here?

483
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,880
They are the guests I invited.

484
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,599
Anyone who dares to make trouble,

485
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,519
is betraying my order.

486
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,759
Open the door!

487
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,559
Open the door!

488
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,240
Open the door!

489
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:50,960
Open the door!

490
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,559
Ms. Kang.

491
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,240
Ms. Kang, are you okay?

492
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,559
Haitang, why are you here?

493
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,240
Come on.

494
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,799
We heard something happened when we came back.

495
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,400
Yuanyin and Qianying went to look for my dad.

496
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,260
I'll save you out of here first.

497
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,559
Wait.

498
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,799
We should find
those tortoise shells with words on them now.

499
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,160
Break the window!

500
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:10,839
Come on.

501
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,039
No.

502
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,519
No, I must stay here.

503
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,119
I need to protect these antiques.

504
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,119
These are Wenyue's treasure for a life time.

505
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,960
You can leave first.

506
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,480
Go, just go!

507
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,039
Haitang, what's wrong?

508
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,599
Are you okay?

509
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,160
Don't move!

510
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,039
Bury your head in your hands.

511
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,960
And get on the ground.

512
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
If you keep moving,

513
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,960
I'll shoot you in the head!

514
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,319
Get on the ground!

515
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,039
Zhang Qi?

516
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,480
Supervisor Bai, it's not because of us.

517
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,279
It's their fault. They eat people.

518
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,359
My kid Yantai must have been eaten by them.

519
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,200
Kid, tell Supervisor Bai about it.

520
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,119
Everyone said,

521
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,720
there are outsiders that will eat villagers.

522
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,240
Yantai took us here to catch that cannibal.

523
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,799
But after we entered there for a while,

524
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,319
we couldn't find Yantai.

525
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,000
He must have been eaten by them.

526
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,599
That's right.

527
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,079
They must have eaten him.

528
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,839
Give me back my child.

529
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Please wait.

530
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,119
We found the kid.

531
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,319
We found the kid.

532
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:34,640
Yantai.

533
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,160
Naughty boy.

534
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,119
Where did you go?

535
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,880
You can't take care of a kid?

536
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,720
He sneaked in and ate food in Fuhua canteen.

537
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,680
He drank the rice wine,

538
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,720
so he fell asleep.

539
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,240
Now we've found the kid,

540
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,039
don't say teachers in Fuhua University eat humans.

541
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,920
Okay.

542
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,440
Everything has been figured out.

543
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,960
You said teachers in university will eat humans.

544
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,720
People will laugh at you when they hear this!

545
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,799
The folk custom in Shang Village is not so good.

546
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:58,960
Enough.

547
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,200
It's midnight now, go home.

548
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,720
Let's go back, villagers.

549
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,759
Let's go.

550
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,160
Okay, let's go back now.

551
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,880
Well, Mr. Ling,

552
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,799
I heard there was a gunshot
when I was looking for the kid.

553
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:09,440
Lanshan!

554
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,319
Is it Zhang Qi?

555
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,359
Haitang!

556
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,319
Haitang!

557
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,599
Are you okay?

558
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,279
Don't move!

559
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,480
Who are you?

560
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,599
How dare you make trouble here?

561
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:42,400
Lanshan!

562
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,440
Mom!

563
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,599
Mom!

564
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,279
Lanshan!

565
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,119
Mom!

566
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,480
Let's go.

567
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,559
Mom!

568
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,200
Lanshan!

569
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,519
Coming.

570
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,240
Ling.

571
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,319
- Lanshan.
- Haitang.

572
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,000
Check Haitang.

573
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,960
What happened?

574
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,960
Did you see Zhang Qi?

575
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,640
- No.
- No.

576
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,679
Haitang, sit down.

577
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,519
- Haitang.
- Haitang.

578
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,480
Haitang, are you okay?

579
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,840
Captain Zhang.

580
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,320
It's you.

581
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,000
Are you okay?

582
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,000
Haitang...

583
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,239
Haitang is there.

584
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,000
Ms. Xu.

585
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:29,920
Don't tell Haitang

586
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,719
I have been here.

587
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,920
Why?

588
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,800
Please.

589
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:37,719
Captain Zhang.

590
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,559
Captain Zhang.

591
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,519
Help me.

592
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,320
Who is he?

593
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,679
The Captain of Jianqiao Hanguang Squadron, Zhang Qi.

594
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,880
Zhang Qi?

595
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,440
The one Haitang is waiting for?

596
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,199
Wake up.

597
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,159
We can't put him here.

598
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,639
We need to send him back.

599
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:56,360
No problem.

600
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,519
I'll send him back.

601
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,159
- Be careful.
- Hold on.

602
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:02,719
Be careful.

603
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,480
You, too.

604
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,599
Be sure to send him back.

605
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,199
Okay.

606
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,079
Come on.

607
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,039
Hurry up.

608
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,599
Come on.

609
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,440
The next one.

610
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,199
Secretary General Meng.

611
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,159
Supervisor Bai.

612
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,280
Thank you so much.

613
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,079
What happened here?

614
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,880
I'm late.

615
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,500
There was a misunderstanding
between people in Shang Village and teachers here.

616
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,800
They caused trouble to you.

617
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,000
Supervisor Bai.

618
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,639
As far as I know,

619
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,599
the situation is not like that.

620
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:51,239
There are many bandits
in Shang Village and on Luofeng Mountain.

621
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,559
Fuhua University is in a dangerous situation now.

622
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,480
Supervisor Bai, can you
send soldiers to suppress bandits?

623
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,880
It would be better if you can
send some soldiers to protect our university.

624
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,679
So,

625
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,880
my army would be bodyguards of Fuhua University?

626
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,159
Supervisor Bai, let me tell you,

627
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,880
Fuhua University is
one of the top universities in China.

628
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,519
About the antique room,

629
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,400
many of the ancient books
and tortoise shells are national treasures,

630
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,960
needless to say the professors and teachers.

631
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,760
They are the talents of the nation.

632
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,679
Supervisor Bai.

633
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,800
You should keep them safe.

634
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,119
Secretary General Meng.

635
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,840
I can send soldiers to suppress the bandits,

636
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,559
but I have a condition.

637
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,960
You need to open
a teacher-training class at Fuhua University.

638
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,559
I can send you some students.

639
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,679
You have a Normal College, right?

640
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,360
Then they can study there.

641
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,320
Well...

642
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,559
you can't enter Fuhua University so easily.

643
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,039
I welcome the students,

644
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,320
but they need to pass the exam.

645
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,159
You're right.

646
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,840
But,

647
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,239
my army can't be easily dispatched as well.

648
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,159
Well,

649
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,079
I'll report to Mr. Chiang first.

650
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,380
This report will be passed to him one by one.

651
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,960
After he approves it,

652
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,880
we can discuss how to dispatch soldiers,

653
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,119
and whose soldiers to dispatch.

654
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,840
Let's discuss it next year.

655
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Supervisor Bai, Supervisor Bai.

656
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,519
Here's the thing.

657
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,199
You want a teacher-training class?

658
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:49,719
Okay.

659
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,199
I agree on behalf of Fuhua University,

660
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,920
but the number of students is limited.

661
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,400
We'll only accept five students.

662
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,840
Okay, let's do as you said.

663
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,559
Okay.

664
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,559
But there are six students.

665
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,000
I'll add one more person. That is my girl.

666
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,320
Secretary General Meng.

667
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,440
If you can educate my daughter well,

668
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,199
I'll give you about 1.3 acres of land
under Luofeng Mountain.

669
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,760
You can move the Law and Business College
in Mengzi to this place.

670
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,159
That's a deal.

671
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:22,920
Okay.

672
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,159
Ling Wenyue didn't go to the antique room at once,

673
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,960
but he stayed there and explain to the villagers.

674
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,320
It means he really doesn't have that.

675
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,400
Director.

676
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,880
How should we deal
with the five people that Supervisor Bai caught?

677
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,159
Tell Baifei's subordinates,

678
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
don't let them reveal anything.

679
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,210
Just regard them as villagers
who are making trouble.

680
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,039
Okay, I'll do as you said.

681
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:16,719
Also,

682
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,960
about the spy I asked you to put around Ling Wenyue...

683
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,639
Qi, why are you so heavy?

684
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,639
I haven't taken care of anyone.

685
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,239
You need to hold on.

686
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,760
We're almost there, hold on.

687
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,760
Be careful.

688
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,639
Sit down and have some rest.

689
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:47,760
Be careful.

690
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Is this your home?

691
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,079
Zhang Qi's mom!

692
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,599
Zhang Qi's mom!

693
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,679
Your son is back!

694
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,360
Are you okay?

695
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,760
Did your wound ache again?

696
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,119
How could you be so careless?

697
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,159
You're injured.

698
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,360
- You can't run.
- Mom...

699
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,199
Mom.

700
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,639
Donglai.

701
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,719
Donglai.

702
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:41,960
Donglai!

703
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,039
Did you wake up?

704
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,280
Yes.

705
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:46,280
Look.

706
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,400
I've made chicken soup for you.

707
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,840
You've been lost for more than two years.

708
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,639
You must have missed the dish I cooked.

709
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,719
Mom.

710
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,440
Come here.

711
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,559
Mom.

712
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What's the smell of this chicken soup?

713
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,119
It's foul.

714
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,599
You don't know how to cook
since you haven't cooked for long?

715
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,800
Naughty boy.

716
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,559
Qi is ill,

717
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,880
so I added his favorite bamboo shoots in chicken soup.

718
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,199
Qi is not as strong as you.

719
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:20,280
Mom.

720
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Give me a reason.

721
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,119
From yesterday,

722
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,639
I felt he was more like a real son to you than me.

723
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,320
What did he tell you?

724
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:28,519
Why did you accept him as your son?

725
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,599
Is it because he is handsome or he is rich?

726
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,920
Donglai.

727
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,519
Zhang Qi and your brother are like brothers
that have experienced life and death.

728
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,679
I lost my kid.

729
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,480
If he hadn't accompanied me like a real son,

730
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,719
I wouldn't have known how to go through those sad days.

731
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,400
Mom, don't be sad.

732
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,880
Well,

733
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,440
go to see if Zhang Qi wakes up.

734
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,599
You had a good sleep last night.

735
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,159
But he had a fever and didn't have a good sleep.

736
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:04,880
Okay.

737
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,719
I'll go after I drink the soup.

738
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,599
What?

739
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,199
Is he really alive?

740
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:19,480
Yes.

741
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:21,400
But,

742
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,000
he didn't want me to tell you he is still alive.

743
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,400
Great.

744
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:27,880
Great.

745
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:28,960
Haitang...

746
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:29,880
Where is he?

747
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,239
I'll look for him.

748
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,639
Haitang.

749
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:34,440
Haitang, be careful.

750
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,000
Haitang, why did you come out?

751
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:37,840
Nianqiao.

752
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,440
Why did you lie to me?

753
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,000
I...

754
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,239
Zhang Qi is still alive.

755
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,599
Where is he? I'll find him.

756
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,000
Haitang, you can't go there.

757
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,000
Why?

758
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,880
Haitang.

759
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,599
Why?

760
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:07,820
