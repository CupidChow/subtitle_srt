[Episode 06]

4
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:39,510
Deputy Director Lu asked you
to send it to Tongmao Antique Shop.

5
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,940
There will be goods
the day after tomorrow morning at Zhengyangmen.

6
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,439
Go.

7
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay.

[Military 4919]

9
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,000
Everyone,

10
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,599
I'll say it straightforwardly.

11
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,280
After today's meeting,

12
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,639
we'll step up the process
of moving the school to the south.

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,479
We'll move to Changsha.

14
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,520
We'll evacuate in three groups.

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,639
The first group will leave tomorrow.

16
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,960
The third group will leave at least two weeks later.

17
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,479
As for when we'll begin to have class,

18
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680
we'll discuss later.

19
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,039
Wuran.

20
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,800
Is there anything you want to add?

21
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,800
In The Book of History, Pan Geng,

22
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,599
it mentioned there was a huge calamity,

23
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,039
the former Emperor didn't stay in the capital,

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,719
he chose to move capital
for people's interest instead.

25
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,120
There are thirteen migration
of capital in Shang Dynasty.

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,080
Until King Pan Geng moved capital to Anyang,

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,039
did he make a dying Shang Dynasty

28
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:10,680
become prosperous when King Wu Ding was in charge.

29
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,680
Everyone,

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
three thousand years ago, our ancestors could do so.

31
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,879
If we can't,

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,719
or,

33
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,520
we don't have the courage to do that,

34
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,639
we would be ashamed to face our ancestors.

35
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,879
I'll tell you our route to the south now.

36
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,720
Universities were occupied by invaders.

37
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,600
Self-esteem was trampled by enemies.

38
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,360
At this crucial moment,

39
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,199
there was an indelible shame in Meng Wuran's mind.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,319
The backbone of scholars.

41
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,720
The responsibility of soldiers.

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,519
Without the soul of a nation,

43
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,839
everything will vanish.

44
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,120
Riksha.

45
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,199
Sir.

46
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,480
Take me to Yunju.

47
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,279
What did you say?

48
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,519
Sir.

49
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,120
Haitang, Haitang...

50
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,959
Meng Haitang...

51
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,480
Miss Meng?

52
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
Sir, sir.

53
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,680
You can't stay here.

54
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,959
This place is dangerous. Sir.

55
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,800
Just go!

56
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
This place is dangerous.

57
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,319
Dad?

58
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,360
What happened to him?

59
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,600
Do you know him, Miss Meng?

60
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,240
He called your name before he fell into a faint.

61
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,360
Yes.

62
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,519
He was fine yesterday.

63
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,519
Why is he injured today?

64
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,879
I don't know.

65
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,399
Luckily, he met me.

66
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,759
I can't throw him in the street.

67
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,839
They will shoot him if they catch him.

68
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,480
Okay, enough.

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,519
Help me get him inside.

70
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,160
Okay.

71
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,439
Zhang Qi.

72
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,920
Zhang Qi.

73
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
Are you okay?

74
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,519
Hai...

75
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,199
Miss Meng.

76
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,079
Are you feeling better now?

77
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,720
Where am I?

78
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,600
This is my room.

79
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,439
I'll leave now.

80
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,160
You're injured.

81
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,199
Have some rest.

82
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,839
I can't stay on your bed.

83
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,879
Just lie down first.

84
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,240
Don't worry.

85
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,199
Shuan helped me get you inside.

86
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,439
You're covered in black oil and so heavy.

87
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,600
You think I want you to stay here?

88
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,079
After my dad comes back,

89
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,959
we'll send you to the hospital.

90
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,159
Well,

91
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,120
I remember you said you would go to Hangzhou.

92
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,360
Why did you get injured in the street?

93
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,720
I should have gone back to report
on the completion of a task on Fuxing.

94
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,840
But when I just arrived at Qinghe Airport,

95
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,799
I saw 024 explode in front of me.

96
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,480
No.

97
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,159
I still have a mission to do.

98
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,159
Just lie down first.

99
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,600
Wait here.

100
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,919
Even if you want to leave,

101
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,279
you should change your clothes first.

102
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,600
These are Haichen's clothes.

103
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,919
Now the Japanese are catching soldiers everywhere.

104
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,399
Uncle Ling was caught yesterday.

105
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,693
My dad is thinking of a solution.

106
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,159
If so,

107
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,960
I should leave early,

108
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,679
or I would bring you troubles.

109
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,960
Change your clothes...

110
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,879
Haitang, are you in room?

111
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,480
It's my mom.

112
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,679
Wait a second.

113
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,639
What's wrong, mom?

114
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,279
Your dad went to Uncle Ling's home
to think of a solution to save him.

115
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,440
He may be back late today.

116
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,559
Go to pack the things with me.

117
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay.

118
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,159
We may leave at any moment.

119
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Don't just stand here.

120
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,080
Let me check inside.

121
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,559
Mom, mom.

122
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,600
Well,

123
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,200
did you pack Haichen's clothes?

124
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,857
Otherwise he would
have no clothes to wear in Hangzhou.

125
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
You're right.

126
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,879
I also need to pack Haichen's clothes.

127
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,600
You're right.

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,080
What's that sound?

129
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,799
It's the cat.

130
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,159
I just hugged it inside
and wanted to say goodbye to it.

131
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,399
It must be running around.

132
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,759
A cat can make such a huge noise?

133
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,720
You're right.

134
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,240
Those cats, flowers, fishes and grass,

135
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,080
they must be suffering a lot.

136
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,240
You're right.

137
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,039
I will also miss that cat.

138
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,440
Let me go inside and see it.

139
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,840
Don't bother, it will be late.

140
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,480
You haven't packed Haichen's clothes yet. Let's go.

141
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,559
I'll help you with it.

142
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,480
Zhang Qi, my dad...

143
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Where is he?

144
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,799
Useless! I'm too useless!

145
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,600
Professor Zeng.

146
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,759
You took action so quickly.

147
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,240
Going to Changsha?

148
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,120
Of course not.

149
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,240
I'll go to Hangzhou during my vacation.

150
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,039
Hangzhou?

151
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,039
Haichen is in Hangzhou.

152
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,960
I wonder if he is recovered now.

153
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,360
He is young. He will be fine.

154
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,399
Meng.

155
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,519
Meng.

156
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,780
The car that the school arranged to take your family

157
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,840
to the train station was smashed on the way.

158
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,879
The driver is also injured.

159
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,480
We can do nothing about it now.

160
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,440
What can we do now?

161
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,879
How could this society become like this?

162
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,000
Professor Zeng.

163
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,759
You're heading to Hangzhou, right?

164
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,679
What's wrong?

165
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,759
How will you go there?

166
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,919
I'll go to Tianjin first,

167
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,679
then I'll go to Hangzhou from Tianjin.

168
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,399
Here is the thing.

169
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,799
Professor Ling offended the Japanese,

170
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,360
and was caught with the accusation
of fighting against the Japanese.

171
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,399
I'm afraid that the Japanese may hurt his family.

172
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,080
Professor Kang will go to Nanjing
and have rubbings in Beiji Pavilion.

173
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm here to beg you, Professor Zeng.

174
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,559
Please take Professor Kang
and her daughter to go to the south with you.

175
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,919
You can separate when you arrive in Nanjing.

176
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:01,919
Let me tell you,

177
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,879
it's dangerous for two women
like them to go there alone.

178
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,679
I'll be relieved if you can go with them.

179
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,159
Please, please, please.

180
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,279
No.

181
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:13,799
No.

182
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,200
No.

183
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,159
No, no, no!

184
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Well, well,

185
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,120
a single man like me

186
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,480
takes a single lady and her daughter in the street.

187
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,559
What will people think of me?

188
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,879
- What are you talking about?
- No, no!

189
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,679
I won't agree.

190
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,159
There will be a war, Mr. Zeng.

191
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,559
Why do you suddenly become so old-fashioned now?

192
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
We were classmates when we were studying abroad.

193
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
We are like brothers and sisters.

194
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,240
Besides,

195
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,399
you've taken many female classmates
to the West Mountain back then.

196
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,736
Now we are at a crucial moment,

197
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,080
but you are worrying about these?

198
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,960
When we went to the West Mountain,

199
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,120
there were many female students.

200
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,440
It's different from traveling with a single woman.

201
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,919
How about this?

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,759
You can leave with a group of women.

203
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,480
Four women.

204
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,840
What about four women?

205
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,360
Four women?

206
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,720
Haitang and my wife will go to Hangzhou with you.

207
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,960
Is that okay?

208
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,559
Oh my god.

209
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,879
I won't enjoy the trip with so many women.

210
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,679
I have something important to do in Hangzhou.

211
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,679
Zeng Mu.

212
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,440
You want Professor Kang and her daughter,

213
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,039
be tortured by those Japanese like your family?

214
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,360
I...

215
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,720
What did you say?

216
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,559
Say that again!

217
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,600
It's urgent, don't care about such a little matter.

218
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,159
Zeng, sorry about that.

219
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,360
Professor Zeng.

220
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,679
I know you care about women and children a lot.

221
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,279
After tomorrow,

222
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,639
I don't know if Professor Ling and I
can take care of these four women.

223
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,120
Well,

224
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,919
please take care of them.

225
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,320
Now you have a good attitude.

226
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,799
It's so annoying!

227
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,440
Thank you, thank you.

228
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,519
Four women!

229
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,159
Please wait here.

230
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,200
I'll inform them.

231
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,480
Thank you, thank you.

232
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,200
Wait for me.

233
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,840
Hurry up!

234
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,960
I'm Zhang Qi, call 01.

235
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:34,799
Your position.

236
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,960
Peiping, around Zhengyangmen.

237
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,080
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,

238
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,720
someone will pick you outside Dongzhimen.

239
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,320
There is a lack of two people, we are waiting for you.

240
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,320
Copy that.

241
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,279
It's so troublesome.

242
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,240
Why did you take so many things with you?

243
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,600
It's so heavy.

244
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,200
What are these things?

245
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,679
Let me tell you, if you follow me,

246
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,159
you will suffer a lot on the way.

247
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,080
Wuran is crazy.

248
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,320
He urged us to leave.

249
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,080
We are not going to visit others.

250
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,279
Well,

251
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,600
we should take some money
since we are leaving so suddenly.

252
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,240
Of course.

253
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,960
We've been living here for decades.

254
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,200
And now we are leaving.

255
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,639
If it's not because I'm worried about Haichen,

256
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,120
I won't leave here so easily.

257
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,360
Dad.

258
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,240
Let's go.

259
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,320
I can't go to Hangzhou.

260
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,120
- Why?
- Because of oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

261
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Haitang.

262
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,720
You don't need to care about these things.

263
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,440
You have to leave Peiping with your mom today.

264
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,919
Just go.

265
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,480
Dad.

266
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,487
You don't have
the real oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

267
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,879
And you can't make a fake one in a short time, right?

268
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,519
Only your Uncle Jin and Uncle Ling
have seen the real one.

269
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,960
So, I have my own way.

270
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,119
Dad.

271
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,440
Since they want that,

272
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,599
it means they've had research on it.

273
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
You can't cheat them.

274
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,200
Haitang, you've grown up.

275
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,440
Remember,

276
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,960
you're the eldest daughter in the family.

277
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,640
You should take care of mom and brother for me.

278
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,319
I'm here,

279
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,599
so everything will be solved.

280
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:32,759
Just go.

281
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,400
Why would you have this?

282
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,880
Last year,

283
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,680
when Uncle Ling took me to Anyang,

284
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,240
a local said,

285
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,079
he went to the vault
with teachers of Fuhua University in 1929,

286
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,920
and discovered a special oracle bone.

287
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,440
He described its pattern.

288
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,759
I suddenly thought of Uncle Ling's oracle bone.

289
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,720
Uncle Ling.

290
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,640
What kind of rubbing is this?

291
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,480
There are so many complete characters on it.

292
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,480
It must be rare.

293
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,640
You don't need to know about this.

294
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,440
Just listen to me carefully.

295
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,000
We've learned about rubbing softly
and wiping to rub, right?

296
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,119
Today I'll teach you a new way to rub,
which is called cicada wing's rubbing.

297
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,240
Watch carefully.

298
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,319
You need to knock it evenly.

299
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,279
Don't be too hard.

300
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,279
Then this...

301
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,960
After that class,
I begged Uncle Ling many times and finally he agreed.

302
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,839
Then he taught me to make this oracle bone
according to that rubbing.

303
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,119
He wouldn't say much about it.

304
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,920
But after that seminar,

305
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,400
I guess
that's the oracle bone of Wuding.

306
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,119
That's right.

307
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,400
This is the will of heaven.

308
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,200
Haitang.

309
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,079
You're a great help.

310
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,279
I'll keep it.

311
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:00,880
Thank you.

312
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,359
Let's go.

313
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,279
Dad, don't you think it's too fake?

314
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,640
I'll find someone skillful
to make it look like an antique.

315
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,640
I know that.

316
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,359
Those experts will know
it's fake according to its appearance now.

317
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Just let me stay with you.

318
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,400
At least I can help you check his skill, right?

319
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,599
Haitang...

320
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,079
It's not just a business of your own.

321
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,759
If there is something wrong,

322
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,160
not only you,

323
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,079
Uncle Ling will suffer as well.

324
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,480
Dad.

325
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,839
I've grown up.

326
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,880
Let me help you, okay?

327
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,799
What did you say?

328
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,480
Haitang won't leave with us?

329
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,640
Here is the thing.

330
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,200
Before Haitang goes to the Normal College,

331
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,799
she still has some homework to do.

332
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,400
I want her to leave with the students
and teachers of Fuhua University,

333
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
so that she can also complete her homework.

334
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,200
I'll stay here and take care of dad.

335
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,480
After you pick up Haichen,

336
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,599
let's meet in Changsha.

337
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,519
You're too slow.

338
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,599
Let's go, come on.

339
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,359
Okay, enough.

340
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,160
Professor Zeng is urging you to leave. Just go.

341
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,440
Take care of our daughter.

342
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,200
- We'll come back sooner or later.
- Be careful.

343
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay.

344
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,279
Be careful.

345
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
Professor Zeng, please...

346
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,599
I want to have a word with you.

347
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,400
Why do you have so much to say?

348
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,160
You helped me a lot,

349
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
I can't thank you enough.

350
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,640
Of course you can find a way to thank me.

351
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,279
I don't have enough instruments in my lab.

352
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,640
Allocate more funds to me when I'm back.

353
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:44,920
Okay.

354
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,759
I know why you stay here.

355
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,240
It's for Professor Ling, right?

356
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,000
Be quiet.

357
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,240
You're capable.

358
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,400
Make sure Professor Ling is safe and sound.

359
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,559
And you.

360
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,000
Be careful,

361
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,759
so that I can still have someone to quarrel with me.

362
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,960
Where is your stick?

363
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,440
It's broken.

364
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,119
Broken?

365
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,359
When you had that stick,

366
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,519
I felt worried.

367
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,519
Now it's broken,

368
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,440
I'm more worried.

369
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,440
Zeng.

370
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,880
Let's bid farewell to each other.

371
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,200
That's enough.

372
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,240
It's too troublesome, I'll leave now.

373
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,839
Okay, let's go.

374
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,640
Haitang, Haitang!

375
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,160
Zeng.

376
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,720
We shall leave now.

377
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,000
Please.

378
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,079
Okay, okay.

379
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:48,720

380
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,640
Remember,

381
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,079
No. 86 in Yunju Alley,

382
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,480
will always be our home.

383
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,039
One day,

384
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,519
we'll come home.

385
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,640
Hurry up.

386
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,480
Coming.

387
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,119
I inquire the road of a wayfarer,

388
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,599
and sulk at the dimness of the dawn.

389
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,000
Haitang,

390
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,440
someday the sun will rise.

The owner of this shop
is a famous appraiser in Peiping.

396
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,400
He knows much about antiques.

397

In order to make money,

398
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,200
he smuggled many antiques.

399
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,359
Your Uncle Ling and I have bought
many precious antiques from him for safekeeping.

At the same time,

401
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,599
he is good at counterfeiting antiques.

402
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,079
I didn't imagine I would beg him
to counterfeit something for me one day.

403
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,039
This is his shop.

404
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,119
Let's see if he can recognize this counterfeit first.

It's been a long time.

Mr. Meng.

408
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,720
You honored me with your presence.

Now everything is in chaos outside.

Only a refined scholar like you
has the mood to visit my shop now.

414
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,440
Boss Yu.

415
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,359
I have something interesting here.

416
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,279
I wonder if you can appraise it.

417
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,519
Okay.

418
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,759
Just say what you want.

419
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,319
Mr. Meng.

420
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Since the Japanese brought
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding out,

421
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,640
its price has been rising in the market.

422
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,759
There are rough counterfeits everywhere.

423
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,440
But,

424
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,920
to be honest,

425
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,519
yours is the most delicate counterfeit I've ever seen.

426
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,319
This is made of a fresh tortoise shell.

427
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,039
Although you made it look like an antique,

428
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,839
experts can recognize it immediately.

429
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,720
Mr. Meng, if you want to sell it at a high price,

430
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,759
you need to further operate on it.

431
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,200
I wonder when you start
to be interested in counterfeits.

432
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,799
If you really want to make it an antique,

433
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,359
you should know
the master of doing that, Lan Baoguang.

434
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,200
He is my senior apprentice.

435
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,039
No one can compare with him in this area in China.

436
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,680
But,

437
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,559
you need to pay him a lot.

438
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,200
How much?

439
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,319
At least this amount of money.

440
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,319
Thirty yuan?

441
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,359
Three thousand yuan.

442
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,880
Boss Yu.

443
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,599
To spend three thousand yuan making a counterfeit?

444
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,200
Are you kidding me?

445
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,359
Three thousand yuan is enough
to buy a huge mansion like this.

446
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,160
Mr. Meng.

447
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:54,799
You're the Secretary General of Fuhua University.

448
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,359
You hate those people who make counterfeits.

449
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,319
Since you are here today,

450
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,160
I guess you've met some troubles.

451
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,920
If what I think is right,

452
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,720
you're doing so for Mr. Ling, right?

453
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,640
Boss Yu.

454
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,880
What do you mean?

455
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,640
Everyone knows it now.

456
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,720
Mr. Ling offended the Japanese and was caught.

457
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,640
Mr. Meng.

458
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:49,960
Is Mr. Ling's life worth three thousand yuan?

459
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,079
Boss Yu.

460
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,079
You thought too much.

461
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,200
I'm in a dangerous situation now.

462
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
I have no time for saving him.

463
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:05,279
I just want to make a counterfeit and sell it,

464
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,519
then we'll leave here.

465
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:15,480
Okay.

466
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,160
Just make it for me first.

467
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,000
We can discuss the price, okay?

468
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:20,920
But there is one thing you should know,

469
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,400
I have to get it before 11 o'clock tonight.

470
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,519
If you delay in delivery,

471
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,559
I won't pay you a penny.

472
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,599
Well, okay.

473
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,400
Let's go back, Haitang.

474
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,960
Mr. Meng, don't worry.

475
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,240
I'll do as you said.

476
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,000
I can surely make it.

477
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,440
Then, I'm looking forward to it.

478
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,119
See you.

479
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,160
Let's go.

480
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:35,839
Officer...

481
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,839
Officer,

482
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,920
please take whatever you want.

483
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,799
Please don't hurt me, officer.

484
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,759
Where did you get this box of goods?

485
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,200
Officer, what did you say?

486
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,640
Officer, you are a Tai-Jiong?

487
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,240
This is a good shop.

488
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,519
I'm working for Tai-Jiong.

489
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,359
Tai-Jiong.

490
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,119
Who owns this box of goods?

491
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,279
Where are you sending it?

492
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,519
Officer.

493
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,240
I'm just selling antiques.

494
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,440
I never asked about other things.

495
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:34,799
Really?

496
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,279
I...I'll tell you!

497
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,559
It suddenly occurs to me.

498
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,039
The buyer is also a Japanese.

499
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,720
He is a scholar.

500
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,200
His name is...

501
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Okayama Shinichi.

502
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,640
He is a famous scholar.

503
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,920
He bought many tortoise shells from here.

504
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,400
I was just helping them to make deals.

505
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,319
It has nothing to do with me.

506
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,559
What about the seller?

507
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,599
I really don't know about the seller.

508
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,039
But,

509
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,680
he must be powerful.

510

He wears a black uniform.

511
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:20,000
You know that. He must be a high-ranking officer.

512
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,400
This one?

513
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,000
Someone asked me to make it look like an antique.

514
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,480
He'll fetch it tonight.

515
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,119
It's a big deal.

516
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:46,000
Tai-Jiong, I can share half of the money with you.

517
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
To be honest,

518
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,400
this is a good counterfeit.

519
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,079
It must have been made by a master.

520
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,000
But the smell is different.

521
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,000
Even if you basked the fresh tortoise shell,

522
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:07,000
its smell is still different from
that of those from several thousand years ago.

523
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,319
You need to fumigate it with smoke.

524
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,680
After I do that, I'll sell it.

525
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,119
Then he'll pay me much money.

526

527
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,200
I'll give the money to you.

Please forgive me.

529
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,039
I shouldn't have lied to you.

530
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,799
According to my experience,

531
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,039
this should be the real one.

Cinnabar?

541
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,680
That's expensive.

542
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't have that.

When you were four years old,

547
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
you fell from this tree,

548
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,200
and had such a big wound on your forehead.

549
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,359
You bled much blood.

550
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,519
Your mom was afraid there would be a scar,

551
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,039
she covered your forehead
with the tea residue I drank.

552
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,240
She knew nothing about infection,

553
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,719
so I scolded her immediately.

554
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,639
Do you still remember that?

555
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,400
I did too many naughty things when I was little.

556
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,219
How could I remember them all?

557
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,119
You know that you were naughty when you were little?

She cleaned this house everyday.

561
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,760
When we decided to leave here a few days ago,

562
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:39,118
she couldn't fall asleep the whole night.

563

We can't live here without your mom.

Your mom is a good woman,

but she is a little narrow-minded.

It's not like that.

They are Haichen, you and me.

570

00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,360
as long as our four people are together,

578
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,400

But,

681
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,360
what are you going to do tomorrow?

682
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:49,960
Tomorrow,

683
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,400
I'll surely save Wenyue from the Japanese.

684
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,320
How...

685
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,400
how will you save him?

686
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:05,760
I'm expecting,

687
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,920
Wenyue could say the first lie in his life tomorrow.

688
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,280
Maybe only by doing so,

689
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:20,320
can we escape this calamity.

690
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,079
Haitang, it's time to wake up.

691
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,880
I'm Uncle Chen.

692
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,480
Your dad asked me to take you to leave here.

693
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,480
Haitang?

694
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:45,860
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

695
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:53,760
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

696
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:01,210
♫ Shed tears to our sweet love ♫

697
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:09,690
♫ The date of return is yet to come ♫

698
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,860
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

699
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,690
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

700
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:24,690
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

701
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:31,940
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

702
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:39,740
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

703
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,890
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

704
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:57,590
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫

705
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,840
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

706
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,360
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

707
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:27,660
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

708
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,690
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

709
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:42,510
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

710
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:48,860
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

711
00:44:49,040 --> 00:45:01,760
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫
