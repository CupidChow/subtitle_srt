[Episode 10]

4
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,120
I live just down there.

5
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,510
Just leave me here.

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,350
That was quick.

7
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,510
Dry your hair as soon as you get home.

8
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,950
And drink more hot water to keep you warm.

9
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,960
Keep this jacket in case you have a cold.

10
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,710
Okay.

11
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,680
No.

12
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,750
My father will be angry if he sees it.

13
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,870
You should take it back.

14
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,030
Alright.

15
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,120
I'm leaving.

16
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,080
Okay.

17
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,630
My stuff.

18
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,150
Here.

19
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,750
Same time the next Tuesday.

20
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,470
I'll see you at the pavilion.

21
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,240
Okay.

22
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,870
- I'm going.
- See you.

23
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,971
Dad, I'm back.

24
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,470
Yuanyin, I have something to tell you.

25
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,280
Go ahead. Let me get the weeds out first.

26
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,371
It can wait.

27
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,240
Come on.

28
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,828
Okay.

29
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,228
Dad.

30
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,885
Yuanyin.

31
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,000
Now the government encourages
everyone to write to Jianqiao.

32
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:57,714
I heard many girls in your school wrote to Jianqiao.

33
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,085
Did you?

34
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,428
No, I... I didn't.

35
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,190
Really?

36
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,142
Sure.

37
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,228
I can't control the things outside.

38
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,430
But our home has its rules.

39
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,085
Girls must be demure.

40
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,800
You can't write to men initially,

41
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,270
let alone go out with that pilot.

42
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,560
Look, although they're pilots,

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,040
being a pilot is a dangerous job.

44
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,257
They can fly up into the sky,
but they might not come back.

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,914
I wish I didn't rent
the next yard to those three families.

46
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,000
There are several pilots of them.

47
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,270
Do you hear what I'm saying?

48
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,950
You should listen to me.

49
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,870
Yes, I... I do.

50
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,628
Your mom and I will find a good family for you.

51
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,485
In times of war, girls should marry reliable men.

52
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
Look at you. Why are your clothes wet?

53
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,270
Go to get changed.

54
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,771
Okay.

55
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,570
[Linjiang University]

56
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,000
Mr. Ling, why are you still up this late?

57
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,885
I'm back to get something.

58
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,190
- Who are you?
- I'm a cleaner here.

59
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,885
It's in the middle of the night.

60
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,314
Why didn't you put the lights on?

61
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,920
The bright lights make me cry.

62
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,830
It's a little strong.

63
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,828
It's late. Maybe tomorrow.

64
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,630
Thank you.

65
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,400
Okay.

66
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,142
- Did you ever see him?
- No.

67
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,940
He did the sweeping in the middle of the night.

68
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,310
Seven pieces are all here.

69
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,040
Looks like he's professional.

70
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,630
He doesn't like this fake.

71
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,571
If he's a real expert,

72
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:25,200
I think he should take this.

73
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,971
This Calendar Exam has
only got to the third chapter.

74
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,457
It's worthless.

75
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,400
They followed you to Hangzhou from Beiping.

76
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,771
They're fast.

77
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,485
Well, that explains they don't have a better lead.

78
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,200
Laoliu said there was a broken
shell in Linjiang University's safety box.

79
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:48,685
He was going to bring it back.

80
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,771
However, Ling Wenyue and Meng Wuran came back.

81
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,310
Is the one that Okayama took to Japan a fake?

82
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,160
What's it with those fragments?

83
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,314
Yeah.

84
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,400
Those teachers got many tricks.

85
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,390
What have you got on Ling Wenyue?

86
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,142
Except for teaching,
he travel in Hangzhou every day.

87
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,771
Like Lingyin Temple,
Leifeng Pagoda and Sudi Causeway.

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,657
He's busy all day.

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,630
Keep an eye on him, no matter what he's up to.

90
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:22,920
Yes.

91
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:37,314
The Central Committee held the enlarged meeting
of the Political Bureau in Luochuan,

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,000
which adopted the Ten Planks
for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation

93
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:42,114
and called for a national
resistance against Japan.

94
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,228
Vice Chairman Zhou is negotiating
with Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing.

95
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,120
He proposed the national military mobilization

96
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,790
and the whole country mobilization

97
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,257
to realize a great union
against Japanese aggression.

98
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,390
What's the specific task at this stage?

99
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,790
The Central Committee affirmed
the August 14th Air Combat.

100
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,828
It pointed the Chinese Air Force
controlled the air through this battle,

101
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:10,685
which made the hesitant and
compromising groups see the power of combat

102
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:12,800
and the possibility of winning the war.

103
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:15,828
Aviators are on the same side for saving the nation.

104
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,428
Plus, the Central Committee
left instructions that

105
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:22,742
Zhang Qi is the backbone of Jianqiao Air Force.

106
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,314
We have to keep helping him
fight against the Japanese.

107
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,542
In the meantime, we should continue
to train fresh pilots within Jianqiao.

108
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,857
However, now within the KMT,

109
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:37,200
there's a rise of the capitulationism
and the compromising mindset.

110
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,910
We have to be aware of it.

111
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,750
This is the enemy fighter.

112
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,342
We send off three fighters for battle.

113
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:48,800
One leader and two wingmen.

114
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,550
The leader is on the top.

115
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,085
Show the hull to the enemy
and lure it into attacking us.

116
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,542
Wingman A should stay close to the enemy fighter

117
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,714
and keep parallel to it.

118
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,750
This position is his blind spot.

119
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,000
So he'll try to get rid of you
and attack the leader above.

120
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
At this moment, Wingman B
suddenly appears and hits the enemy.

121
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,910
Remember to hit this point.

122
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,440
The 96's tank is behind the engine.

123
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,600
Just hit its engine and the tank will be on fire.

124
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,240
This tactic requires three pilots to work as one.

125
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,942
The leader should be bold.

126
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,240
Dare to show its hull.

127
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,510
Wingman A should be accurate enough.

128
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:32,057
Get close enough to
the enemy fighter to make it panic.

129
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,720
Wingman B should be like an assassin, here and there.

130
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,000
Then, win in one move.

131
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,270
031, be ready.

132
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,390
095, be ready.

133
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,670
Do the flying swing according
to the scheduled operational plan.

134
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,320
095, Roger.

135
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,480
095, Roger.

136
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,480
How dare you remove the subsidiary tank?

137
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,840
Did you report?

138
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,600
No?

139
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,120
I told the mechanical team.

140
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,600
They didn't show you?

141
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,910
Do you know you'd be killed
with the plane if you were one minute late?

142
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,514
Report.

143
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,510
The pilots always keep track of time.

144
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:06,200
They won't delay, even for a second.

145
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:08,228
You changed the aircraft arbitrarily.

146
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,457
Many people in Hanguang Squadron are watching you.

147
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,600
You're the captain.

148
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,030
You must act with caution.

149
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,914
You can't let them talk about you.

150
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:16,628
Minister of Education,

151
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:19,360
I took off the tank to fly up into the sky and battle.

152
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,771
I didn't have time to care who was watching me.

153
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,630
Look, Minister of Education.

154
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,550
Can we promote the tactic
of Flying Swing in all destroyer brigades?

155
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,840
This plan works when it's in battle outnumbered.

156
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:34,914
What if our warplanes are not as many as the enemy's?

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,870
Then we should change the tactic.

158
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:42,030
The leader switches, localized outnumbering.

159
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:45,028
Like the Cavalry Tactic
in the ancient European battlefields,

160
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,240
you told me before.

161
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:50,685
I didn't expect you to use
the cavalry tactic in air combat.

162
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,870
Report.

163
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,485
Tactics require flexibility.

164
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,870
Comprehend by analogy.

165
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,120
You taught me that.

166
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,440
However, we can't just have tactics.

167
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,030
Our fighters are badly
in need of upgrade and renovation.

168
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,285
Minister of Education,

169
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,150
Professor Zeng Mu of
Fuhua University is my teacher.

170
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,085
He's one of the top aerodynamics
and physics masters in the country.

171
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,630
If we can ask him to act as
our fighters' modification consultant,

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,440
and recruit a mechanic training class,

173
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,371
the problem of remodeling
our planes in wartime can be solved.

174
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,270
Okay.

175
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,750
I'll tell the president
about this flying swing plan.

176
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,870
We can try to promote it.

177
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:37,390
But, Zhang Qi, you made a quick
flight training among the fresh soldiers.

178
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,840
And you promised them if they
could do well in the test in one month,

179
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,200
you'd teach them the flying swing.

180
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,030
One month?

181
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,840
A beginners' class can't even be done in one month.

182
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,120
How can they finish the flying swing plan,
such a dangerous action?

183
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,910
You're forcing them.

184
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,630
I have no other ways.

185
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,670
According to our current casualties,

186
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,480
they got three to four months of training at most.

187
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,360
Once we veterans are killed,

188
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:04,514
they must be ready for battle in the air.

189
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,510
If they're like the Italians
who still suck after two years of training,

190
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,840
sending them into the sky may mean their death.

191
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:14,742
I'd rather train them as soon as possible

192
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,600
in a relatively safety situation,

193
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,870
than leave them vulnerable in the sky.

194
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,960
I think the best defense is a good offense.

195
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,600
I teach them the flying swing
to increase their chance to live.

196
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,360
Zhang Qi, you're ready for battle in the air.

197
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,030
You're in training yourself
and you train the fresh soldiers.

198
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,510
It's a bit intense.

199
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,360
However, you have to be in charge of your own body.

200
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,120
Don't burn yourself out before you fly.

201
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,360
Besides, 019 has a mechanical team.

202
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,550
You always want to modify it.

203
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,200
If something happens, you can't explain it.

204
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,750
Yes.

205
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,550
Nanjing is calling for international support.

206
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,270
Once the UK and the US make a mediation,

207
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,750
I think the war would stop.

208
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,870
At present, we should save our strength and hold it.

209
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,270
The civil unrest is the worst
problem for the authority.

210
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,120
Minister of Education,
they all said we'd force Japan out of China

211
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,390
with the international pressure.

212
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,600
But there's something I've always wanted to ask.

213
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,150
The blood of the army is not blood?

214
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,320
The life of the air force is not life?

215
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,150
We paid such a big price to fight against
the Japanese fair and square, didn't we?

216
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,000
Or is it just a show for others?

217
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:50,270
Zhang Qi, how could you question
the chairman's strategic vision?

218
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,510
I'm warning you.

219
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,630
Following orders is
what soldiers were born to do.

220
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,840
You're the ace of aces in Jianqiao Airport.

221
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,057
Don't think about what you shouldn't think about.

222
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,510
Don't listen to the ideas of the Communist Party.

223
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:07,028
You have to be loyal to the party and the country.

224
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,840
And be ready for following their orders.

225
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,510
Don't think you can do whatever
you want because I love talents.

226
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,550
If you say something insubordinate again,

227
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,120
I'll fire you and kill you.

228
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,670
Yes.

229
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,550
Minister of Education, did you ever think about it?

230
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,960
Will the UK and the US act as a mediator,

231
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,120
even if they saw our sacrifice?

232
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,550
Will Japan listen to them?

233
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,000
I think, as soldiers,
there are only six words about the battle:

234
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,390
fight if you want to fight.

235
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,160
Scholar Meng.

236
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,510
Come out.

237
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,790
I'm coming.

238
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,510
Why are you shouting?

239
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,550
Who pissed you off?

240
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,485
Didn't you find something at your door?

241
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,920
The other side.

242
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,480
Wasn't your cane broken?

243
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,750
I can't hear you knock on the floor every day.

244
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,720
I'm not used to it.

245
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,070
Take it.

246
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,550
Mr. Zeng, thank you so much.

247
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,830
I didn't expect you nerdy professor could make this.

248
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,480
Don't get too happy.

249
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,110
You must promise me two things.

250
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,270
Say.

251
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,510
First, you know a lot of people in Hangzhou, right?

252
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,550
Find a job for me at Linjiang University.

253
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,971
I only want Linjiang University.

254
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,110
Got it.

255
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,440
Besides, when will you return to Fuhua University?

256
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,920
Will my physics lab be built?

257
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,030
Sure, your lab will be built.

258
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,240
But it should wait until the school got set up.

259
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,240
I have to build a top lab.

260
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,830
I want to make a new project.

261
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,400
I want to study atom fission.

262
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:38,960
The colleague of my teacher, Mr. Rutherford

263
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:44,960
bombarded Lithium-7 with artificially
accelerated protons five years ago,

264
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,314
which successfully split
into two alpha particles.

265
00:18:48,342 --> 00:18:50,228
Well, you wouldn't understand.

266
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:52,790
I just want an accelerator.

267
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:54,590
You have to help me get it.

268
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,640
Okay.

269
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,830
Let me tell you,

270
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:01,750
it's the future of physics.

271
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,510
I can't miss the future
of the Chinese physics anymore.

272
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,914
Understand?

273
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,030
Yes.

274
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,110
For the future of physics,

275
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:17,750
I'll get you an accelerator.

276
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,070
Right.

277
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,640
To accelerate your fission.

278
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,750
To accelerate your fission.

279
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:24,200
You ignorant.

280
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm not talking to you.

281
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,160
Do you not divide?

282
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,790
Go.

283
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,880
Do you hear it?

284
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,310
What's up, captain?

285
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,400
You're not feeling well?

286
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,440
I'll let you win, or Hanxun will cry later.

287
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,070
I'm not going to cry.

288
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,880
Report.

289
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,828
Letters for Hanguang Squadron.

290
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,680
Letters from girls again?

291
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,590
Any for me?

292
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:07,790
Huansheng.

293
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,110
I even got a letter?

294
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,960
Nianqiao.

295
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,440
Kejing.

296
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,960
Hanxun.

297
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,400
Jin Chao, He Yan.

298
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,400
Zhou Yiwu.

299
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,110
Here.

300
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,110
No.

301
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,270
Captain, where's mine?

302
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,030
No.

303
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,000
It's impossible.

304
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,920
Look.

305
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,714
[To Captain Zhang Qi]

306
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,000
Alright.

307
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,200
I miss it. There is one for you.

308
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:44,971
Captain.

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,828
[To Zhang Qi]

310
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,257
Who are you writing to?

311
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,750
Why are you always walking like a cat?

312
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,550
I got you easily.

313
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,880
Writing A Letter to Jianqiao Pilots
has been carried out for so long.

314
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,030
You're the only one who never
reads, replies or receives letters.

315
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,550
Today you're writing back seriously.

316
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,790
And you wrote so many drafts.

317
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:02,160
Who's the lucky citizen
that you take her so seriously?

318
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,590
You replied a letter like
you answered a report every time.

319
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,510
No one dares to write to you again.

320
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,510
How's your reply this time?

321
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,680
Show it to me.

322
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,550
You know what, I do like someone this time.

323
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,942
I think she's special.

324
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:28,914
She sent the same letter
to everyone in our squadron.

325
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,342
It's like the code.

326
00:22:32,457 --> 00:22:35,314
Did you see there's a paragraph in the envelope?

327
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,510
I'm going back to the dorm.

328
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,160
What? You quit?

329
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,310
Yeah.

330
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,960
Look at the time. Why is she not here yet?

331
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,680
Yuanyin.

332
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,270
Poshan.

333
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,000
Here you are.

334
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,030
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, I just got here.

335
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,685
I copied it from the book.

336
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,310
August 8th.

337
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,240
People always think they can't change their fate.

338
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
And they obey it.

339
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,590
But I don't.

340
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,160
Yuanyin.

341
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,480
Are you okay?

342
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,030
I finished this book.

343
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,750
Here you are.

344
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,030
I don't need to copy it anymore.

345
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,270
Why?

346
00:24:47,428 --> 00:24:50,400
It felt different when I read the book you copied.

347
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,750
What's different?

348
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,240
The content is same.

349
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,510
Werther, Lotte and Albert.

350
00:25:00,114 --> 00:25:04,171
I can feel your mind when I read the book you copied.

351
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:06,400
Sometimes you get excited,
your writing is a scribble.

352
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:08,960
I can feel your emotions are churning.

353
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,000
Sometimes you're sad,

354
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,680
some characters become faint because of tears.

355
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,310
I'd imagine you copying while crying.

356
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,310
Just like you finish the book with me.

357
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,240
Tell me you like this part and prefer that part.

358
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,680
Like you're always with me.

359
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,680
Yuanyin.

360
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,750
Her breath blows through me all the time.

361
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:40,110
It's intoxicating.

362
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,960
I'd shiver like I got a shock.

363
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,350
The first thing I did was to go to Lotte.

364
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,310
Except for this,

365
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,550
I don't want to do anything.

366
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,200
I can't believe you could memorize it.

367
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,960
I read the book you copied for me many times.

368
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,750
Yuanyin.

369
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,342
There is something I want to tell you.

370
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,720
Stop.

371
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,720
My father said he wouldn't allow me to date a pilot.

372
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,440
The captain was not so sick yesterday.

373
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,171
He just got a cough.

374
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,590
You know him well.

375
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
He doesn't say anything.

376
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,200
He's awake.

377
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,880
Captain, how do you feel?

378
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,640
A little hot.

379
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,270
It's okay.

380
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,830
Let's take him to the infirmary.

381
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:04,830
There's a lesson for Haiyu's Class today, right?

382
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:06,110
I have to teach the class.

383
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,790
Come on. Forget it.

384
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,550
Get some rest.

385
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,000
You're so sick.

386
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,640
Niaoqiao and I will take your job.

387
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,270
Yes.

388
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
I'll get Chen Ran here to take care of you later.

389
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,960
Just try to rest.

390
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:20,457
Second elder brother and I
will take care of your class.

391
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,960
Here.

392
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,000
Let's go.

393
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,200
Come on, follow me.

394
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,240
Go.

395
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,960
Slow down.

396
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,550
Brother Nianqiao.

397
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,310
Nianqiao.

398
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,110
Huansheng, Nianqiao.

399
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:55,400
Where is Zhang Qi?

400
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,680
He's sick.

401
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,171
We're here to teach the class for him.

402
00:27:58,514 --> 00:27:59,550
Sick?

403
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,480
Everybody. Attention. At ease.

404
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,228
Mr. Zeng is going to teach you military boxing today.

405
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,480
Everyone looks at me.

406
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,960
Second elder brother.

407
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,310
How is Zhang Qi's illness?

408
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,880
He made a fast training,

409
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,350
plus the fresh soldiers of our squadron,

410
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,440
it's intense for him.

411
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:23,440
And there's an activity of fighting
the enemy in nighttime from time to time.

412
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,457
The captain was too tired.

413
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,640
He's unhappy and preoccupied.

414
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,714
He got wet in the long-distance
physical training the other day.

415
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,680
So he had a high fever late last night.

416
00:28:31,714 --> 00:28:33,820
He insisted on coming here this morning.

417
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:35,070
Niaoqiao and I stopped him.

418
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,550
He got a fever?

419
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,160
Let's go to see him.

420
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,714
Take it easy.

421
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,830
Chen Ran is looking after him.

422
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,914
There's not much you can do about it down there.

423
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:46,171
Why are you so concerned about him?

424
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:48,514
It's useless.

425
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,550
You said there's not much
I could do about it down there.

426
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,160
Would you like to hear the captain's history?

427
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,590
The guys said the captain got 18 girls.
Don't listen to them.

428
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,440
In fact, the captain is not like other officers.

429
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,720
He's as clean as a child.

430
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,000
He thinks about only one thing: serve the country.

431
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,640
He doesn't talk much usually.

432
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,240
But he cares about the guys.

433
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,160
Take me, for example.

434
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,030
I grew up in a poor family.

435
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,790
I was adopted by four families.

436
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,000
However, the captain is very concerned about me.

437
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,270
He called me second elder brother.

438
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,830
Because he really treats me like his brother.

439
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,070
Second elder brother,
why did you just say he was unhappy?

440
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,240
What happened to him?

441
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,110
He wrote to a girl for once in his life.

442
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,200
But he found that girl wrote
the same letter to everyone in the squadron.

443
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,350
So he was a little upset.

444
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,720
Turns out he's unhappy about this.

445
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,110
The girl you just mentioned is me.

446
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,480
It's you?

447
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:20,960
Then why did you write the same letter to everyone?

448
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,314
I wanted to encourage them.

449
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,070
That's what he's angry about.

450
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,920
Cheapskate.

451
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:37,880
The captain is very poor now.

452
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,790
He's talking nonsense for the fever.

453
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,880
What did he say?

454
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,880
He said he wanted to drink his mom's soup so bad.

455
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,750
Because his mom is from Hongkong.

456
00:30:51,885 --> 00:30:53,750
Maybe he's used to drinking it.

457
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:57,640
So he wants to drink his mom's soup when he got sick.

458
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,720
Mr. Kang.

459
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,830
It smells so good. You're making soup?

460
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,110
Yeah, lotus root with chops.

461
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,240
It's almost done. I make enough for your family.

462
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,830
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

463
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,550
But I got so big. I can't always get free food.

464
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,000
Why not you teach me how to make soup?

465
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,550
Okay.

466
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,742
What do you want to learn?

467
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,680
I heard Cantonese made soup properly.

468
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,270
I got this.

469
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,070
Now food is very scarce, let alone a chicken.

470
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,270
Where did you get it?

471
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,200
From Xu's Family.

472
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,680
I got it from Yuanyin with a rubbing.

473
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,240
But you can't just have a chicken.

474
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,000
It'd be better if you get
some astragalus in the pharmacy.

475
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,720
With that, the soup will have nutritional value.

476
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,640
Okay, I'm going to the pharmacy now.

477
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,070
Mr. Kang, shall I buy some herbs to cook in the soup?

478
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,640
What would be good if someone has a fever?

479
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,640
Who has a fever?

480
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,110
I'm just asking.

481
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,310
It doesn't matter. Chicken soup is warm.

482
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,510
People, sick or well, can drink it.

483
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:23,000
It'll build up the strength.

484
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,160
Okay, I'll be right back.

485
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,110
Who has a fever?

486
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,680
Be bold when fly low.

487
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,857
Don't hesitate about the techniques.

488
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,400
Mom.

489
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,510
Let me, you have back problems.

490
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,960
Don't keep bending.

491
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,680
Here.

492
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,400
It's okay.

493
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,350
Let me.

494
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,070
993.

495
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,240
- An aircraft.
- What a big plane!

496
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
It's so high!

497
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:24,628
♫ The shimmer penetrates the crack of the clouds ♫

498
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:29,885
♫ I can't hide my thought of you ♫

499
00:33:30,857 --> 00:33:37,200
♫ Everything is you, near and far ♫

500
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,160
Look.

501
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,880
Look, it's back.

502
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,200
Shaking the wings means to
say hello to people on the ground.

503
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,960
The wings are moving.

504
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
♫ Time passes ♫

505
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,270
♫ I go after you ♫

506
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,110
Be careful.

507
00:33:59,657 --> 00:34:06,057
♫ Make many paper planes ♫

508
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:13,770
♫ to carry the promise ♫

509
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:24,570
♫ My thought of you has wings to fly up into the sky ♫

510
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,342
♫ I'll wait for you with the sunset
and the night breezes ♫

511
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,257
♫ Watch the changing of seasons ♫

512
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:34,969
♫ The clouds will eventually meet the wind, we too ♫

513
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:38,570
♫ Step in time and space ♫

514
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:49,371
♫ Go to meet you, as promised ♫

515
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,920
Zeng Poshan.

516
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,880
Yes.

517
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,150
Why are you 20 minutes behind schedule?

518
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,230
I...

519
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:17,485
Recite the flight principals ten times.

520
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,190
Yes.

521
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,710
I: safety first.

522
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,840
II: be bold and careful.

523
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,590
III: weapons are our lives.

524
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,000
IV: disciplines are our souls.

525
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,440
V: satisfaction makes people fall behind.

526
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,150
Why laughing? Where do you go?

527
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,190
IX: always keep our pleasure.

528
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,942
Madam Kang.

529
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:53,942
Where did you get this chicken?

530
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,230
Now chicken is expensive.

531
00:35:55,828 --> 00:35:57,920
Haitang just brought it here.

532
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,828
She said she wanted to learn to make chicken soup.

533
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:01,142
Learn to make chicken soup?

534
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,190
Your daughter never does housework.

535
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,590
I don't know why she suddenly
wants to learn how to make chicken soup.

536
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,760
She asked me what herbs would be good for a fever.

537
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,800
Fever?

538
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,000
No one has a fever.

539
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,400
Fever?

540
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,760
I got it.

541
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,110
It's Zhang Qi, the son of Zhang's Family.

542
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,550
It's the first time my girl cooked.

543
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:33,630
I'm afraid she'll cook for Zhang Qi in the future.

544
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,000
Might not.

545
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,000
Maybe she just said it.

546
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,670
A mother knows her daughter best.

547
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,400
Mr. Kang, please play along with me later.

548
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,710
I'd like to test my daughter.

549
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,400
Mr. Kang, your lotus root soup
with chops is so great.

550
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,280
Haichen didn't want to eat for the past two days.

551
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,400
He drank a bowl of soup today.

552
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,590
Look, you're a scholar. Why do you cook so well?

553
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,400
I learned it since childhood
because I was interested in it.

554
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,000
I think you Ling's Family eats properly,

555
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,000
just like Meng's old friend,
Zhang Buchun's Family.

556
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,030
His wife is from the south.

557
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,190
Their tastes are different.

558
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:29,400
Zhang Qi liked his mom's Cantonese
soup since he was a kid.

559
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,070
His mom liked to put vinegar in the soup.

560
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,320
The more acidic, the better.

561
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,960
Zhang Qi likes that taste.

562
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,400
Come on, how could you tell such a lie?

563
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,280
How? She's no match for me.

564
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,710
What's it in your bag?

565
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,590
It smells bad.

566
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:29,440
None of your business.

567
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Bing Bing, take a picture with Mr. Zeng.

568
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,880
Mr. Zeng, take a photo with your student.

569
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,230
What for?

570
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,230
Mr. Zeng, please take a photo
with your student, for a souvenir.

571
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,150
Look, the 20th girl.

572
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,150
The captain has so many admirers.

573
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,800
Nothing to take.

574
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,590
Yes.

575
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,510
This is a petunia.

576
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,000
Second elder brother,
do you think there are any more peonies?

577
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,550
Mr. Zeng, closer.

578
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,480
Bing Bing, a little closer.

579
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,630
Okay. Here. One, two.

580
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
One more.

581
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,000
Enough.

582
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,150
Alright.

583
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,190
I'm here to see the aircraft, not to take a picture.

584
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,190
Zhang Qi.

585
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,840
Does Gao Zhihang have any drawings
for the modification of Hawker III?

586
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,710
Yes.

587
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,550
Show it to me.

588
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,150
Here.

589
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
Looks like you came prepared.

590
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Nice.

591
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,590
Get me a wrench.

592
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,400
I'm going to check the cabin.

593
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,960
Okay.

594
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Am I that old?

595
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,710
Your teacher is just like you.

596
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,314
Neither of you would give in.

597
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,030
Because I'm his student.

598
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,440
Where is Hong'en?

599
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,360
He came with me.

600
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,320
We split up.

601
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,230
Captain Gao has him. And you have me.

602
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,840
But he warned me.

603
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,400
He asked me to keep you at a distance.

604
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,190
I can't touch you but take a photo of you.

605
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,800
I think he's too concerned about you.

606
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:35,657
Huansheng.

607
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,190
Haitang.

608
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,590
Why are you here?

609
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,400
I... I came to see you.

610
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,440
Well...

611
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,030
He's out.

612
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,480
I feel you're not looking good.

613
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,590
Do you feel bad?

614
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,150
Don't move.
