[Jin Zhilie, Professor of History Department,

[Ling Wenyue, Professor of History Department,
School of Chinese Studies, Fuhua University]

6
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
There's been something going on in the south.

7
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,960
My eyelids keep twitching.

8
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,800
Haichen's not back

9
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,390
from military training in Lugou Bridge yet.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,830
I'm always worried that something will happen to him.

11
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,520
Haitang is old enough
[Kang Lanshan, Professor of Chinese Department]

12
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,319
to get married as soon as possible.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
Professor Kang,

14
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,719
there are few people selling flowers

15
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,650
in the flower market today,

16
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,560
[Chen Dairong, Professor of Chinese Department,
School of Chinese Studies, Fuhua University]

17
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,759
so the flowers are not very good,

18
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,639
which are not very fresh.

19
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,479
It doesn't matter.

20
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,080
Just put them in the water for a while.

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,520
Chen,

22
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,610
from now on,

23
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,990
you don't have to send flowers every week.

24
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,680
It's very messy outside now,

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,520
so I have no mind to care about this.

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,840
These flowers are my hope in the world of chaos.

27
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,960
I think it's a good habit

28
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,680
which should be kept.

29
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,159
I'll go to put the flowers up.

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,759
This Mr. Chen,

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,919
he's been sending you flowers

32
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,280
since you were unmarried.

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
Now that Qian Ying is 16,

34
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,680
he's still doing this.

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,319
Speaking of this,

36
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,319
it's your Mr. Ling

37
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,560
who is more generous.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,439
He has nothing to worry about.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,039
We've been friends since we were kids.

40
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,360
Do you think that

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,400
Professor Jin Zhilie will come today?

42
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,159
Professor Jin, you're at home.

43
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,159
Come down and join us.

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,479
Come to Courtyard No. 86.

45
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,719
Let's have a meal and chat together.

46
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Uncle Meng.

47
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,800
He's coming.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,639
He's coming.

49
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,950
- Wuran,
- We're waiting for you.

50
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,439
we're all waiting for you.

51
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,720
I went to find Jin.

52
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,480
He still didn't open the door.

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,639
It's our turn next month,

54
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
so get ready.

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,360
Okay.

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,600
No problem.

57
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,000
It doesn't matter.

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,000
My girl.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,079
Taste Lanshan's cooking.

60
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,199
Sorry,

61
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,120
my daughter was raised silly by her.

62
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,240
Everyone, make yourself at home.

63
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,680
My girl.

64
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,040
Would you like something to eat?

65
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,800
Enjoy yourselves.

66
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,399
Okay.

67
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,480
Don't feed with chopsticks, will you not eat?

68
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,439
Go wash your hands.

69
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,519
There's nothing on that Zeng Nianqiao.

70
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,319
Jin Zhilie,

71
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,560
he must be a communist.

72
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,720
But he's always on a single line with people.

73
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,600
Except him

74
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,160
I don't know any other communists.

75
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,480
And I've never seen the thing you want.

76
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,279
Why don't you let me go?

77
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll go back to Jin Zhilie,

78
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,279
and try my best to

79
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,199
get that back for you.

80
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,720
Zhu,

81
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,160
go back?

82
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,199
Can you go back?

83
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,399
You've already been exposed to Jin.

84
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,680
Count on you?

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
I'd rather meet Jin myself.

86
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,560
Kill him.

87
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,120
No, Boss.

88
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,079
Boss.

89
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,680
Boss, no, Boss.

90
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,240
Come on.

91
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,240
Our Mr. Zeng has no concept of time,

92
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,399
and is always late.

93
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,279
But the worse problem is that

94
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,639
he is not gregarious.

95
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,079
Who's not gregarious?

96
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,720
He's coming.

97
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,879
I just took a nap.

98
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,879
Then you guys are eating.

99
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,879
And you didn't call me.

100
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,079
Come on.

101
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,240
How bad you are.

102
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,600
Mr. Zeng, please.

103
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,000
Sit down.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,319
- Uncle Zeng, take a seat.
- Uncle Zeng.

105
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,199
Please, please.

106
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,319
Where is Jin Zhilie?

107
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,120
Don't say I'm not sociable anymore.

108
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,170
He is not gregarious.

109
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,959
We get together here.

110
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,839
Every time we get together, he never shows up.

111
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,240
So does you.

112
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,319
Brother Zeng Mu.

113
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,000
Zeng what?

114
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:13,879
I'm not Zeng Mu.

115
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,279
Don't talk about you.

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,079
Anyway,

117
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,480
our Mr. Jin is a strange person.

118
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,439
I think he became weird

119
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,519
after he came back from Anyang.

120
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,000
He looks like that.

121
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,959
Trust me.

122
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,399
I tell you that

123
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,600
especially Mr. Ling,

124
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,800
the people like Mr. Jin

125
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,680
who always works with the tomb,

126
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,890
must have a bodhisattva worn on him

127
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,480
to ward off evil.

128
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,079
Really?

129
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,160
Eat some meat.

130
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,839
No wonder.

131
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,560
No wonder he is so thin.

132
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,759
Sister Haitang,

133
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,480
when you been out today,

134
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,120
Auntie Meng said that she got a master

135
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,399
to tell her that your future husband

136
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,160
will be a man with begonia flowers.

137
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,730
And this marriage will benefit from

138
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,439
the power of the heavens,

139
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,600
and is bound to the sky.

140
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,399
Mom,

141
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
I've told you that

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,120
I will never get married.

143
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,680
If you force me again, I will go to be a nun.

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,519
Shut up.

145
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,240
The pilots of Jianqiao,

146
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
with Mrs. Jiang's love,

147
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,600
are really domineering and defiant.

148
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,240
A strong dragon cannot defeat a local snake.

149
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,560
Sir,

150
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,120
they're just a bunch of kids.

151
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,920
You are the central officer

152
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,879
who is highly valued by Madam.

153
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,040
Besides,

154
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,000
two years ago,

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,480
in the aircraft procurement in Italy,

156
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,199
you have made great contributions.

157
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,360
I'm too old to

158
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,639
to afford the love of Mrs. Jiang.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,639
Yes.

160
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,000
Zeng Nianqiao should

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
have transferred the thing.

162
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,120
What progress did Xu Te make?

163
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,690
Chief Xu just called and said that

164
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,850
he's going to take action tonight

165
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,159
to arrest Jin Zhilie.

166
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,759
He can't touch the people of Fuhua University.

167
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,840
Go to call him.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,720
Yes, sir.

169
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,480
Come on.

170
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,480
Come on.

171
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,440
The sound of gunshots?

172
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,000
Are there gunshots?

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,639

The exposure of his identity

207

also means that

00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,159
flies the plane the day after tomorrow?

345
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,639
You?

346
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,039
Isn't it Fang from Nanyuan?

347
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,559
He's been replaced.

348
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:09,318
When?

349
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,240
Why don't I know that?

350
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,039
One second ago.

351
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
No way.

352
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,239
It should be approved by the head of education.

353
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,680
How's that?

354
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,499
Give me half a page of the recruitment notice.

355
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,519
That's interesting.

356
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,440
But,

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,240
I remember you

358
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
fly the single-seater Hawker III, right?

359
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,960
This Fuxing is a two-seater, right?

360
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,000
Can you fly it?

361
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,839
I can when I fly it.

362
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,680
In January this year,

363
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,519
one crashed during a test flight in Guangdong,

364
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,559
the pilot was dead.

365
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,119
What?

366
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,599
Are you worried about me?

367
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,480
Yes.

368
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,880
How can we not worry about you?

369
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,319
Since you joined the Air Force in Jianqiao,

370
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,319
we are all worried about you.

371
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,079
I just want everyone to know

372
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,440
what is the supreme flight.

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,799
Let's settle it.

374
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,759
Sir,

375
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,000
as the request of the donor,

376
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,880
the test pilot of Fuxing will be changed tomorrow.

377
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,519
Who?

378
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,279
Zhang Qi.

379
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,519
How could it be him?

380
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,079
Is my cargo still on the Fuxing?

381
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,880
Both planes are loaded.

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,440
We planned to fly back to Hangzhou

383
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,660
as soon as the test flight was over.

384
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,640
No.

385
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,480
I don't trust this guy.

386
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,160
Take the cargo out now.

387
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,400
Keep me informed of any problems.

388
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,160
Yes, sir.

389
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,440
Someone is coming.

390
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
In my opinion,

391
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,440
don't sleep for the next two days,

392
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,319
let's work all the time.

393
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:55,799
Sun,

394
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:56,960
you're here early.

395
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,759
It's the test flight soon,

396
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,960
so I came to check again.

397
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,440
I did find something wrong.

398
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,920
Here, it needs to be welded.

399
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,759
Sir,

400
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,319
the cargo in 023 could not be withdrawn.

401
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,680
I can't make it.

402
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,280
Sun has welded the cargo box

403
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,319
and the bilge cover tightly.

404
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,880
Don't worry, sir.

405
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,400
No one pays attention to the bilge.

406
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,599
Whether it can be mass produced

407
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,319
to make up for the lack of our fighter jets

408
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,319
is up to you.

409
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,599
Tomorrow,

410
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,000
fighting.

411
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,160
Come on.

412
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,759
Wait.

413
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,279
Hurry up.

414
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,839
Sister Haitang,

415
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,039
why don't we sit on the bleachers,

416
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,400
but climb on the wall?

417
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,799
My father is there.

418
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,960
I can't let him see me.

419
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,720
Watching the test flight is not a bad thing,

420
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,500
why are you afraid of being seen by him?

421
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,440
You'll know it later.

422
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:36,319
Sister, what's in your bag?

423
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,599
It's so heavy.

424
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,960
Surprise.

425
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,319
Every time you say surprise,

426
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,519
it always ends up being a shock.

427
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,319
It's really a surprise this time.

428
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,559
Look.

429
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,480
Fuxing,

430
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,880
with two 7.62 caliber in front-firing,

431
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,230
fixed machine guns on the upper wing,

432
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,440
one in the rear seat,

433
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,359
and four bomb racks under the wing.

434
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,839
It is a national production.

435
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,160
Our China can also produce our own aircraft.

436
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,200
What's the use of memorizing numbers so well?

437
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,119
Why don't you fly it by yourself?

438
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,160
We don't have the chance.

439
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,079
Look!

440
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,839
The pilot is coming out.

441
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,599
Where?

442
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,960
Over there.

443
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,440
That's him.

444
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
Give it back to me after you see it.

445
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,519
That Zhang Qi is also a pilot, right?

446
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,440
Pilots are so brave.

447
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,200
If it were me, I'd marry him.

448
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,599
Let me see,

449
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,960
let me see.

450
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,640
Okay.

451
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,079
Let me have a look.

452
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,799
Hurry up.

453
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Captain, wingman,

454
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,920
look here.

455
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
One two.

456
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,079
Thanks to Xing Hua Times this time,

457
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,559
so many viewers came.

458
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,640
Yes.

459
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,240
So you have to perform well.

460
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,839
There are many aspiring youths outside,

461
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,039
after your flight,

462
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,160
will sign up for the army.

463
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,160
Don't worry.

464
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,400
Miss Long, please leave.

465
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes, Fei Fei.

466
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,799
Now let's welcome the representative of education,

467
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,519
Secretary General of Fuhua University,

468
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,039
Mr. Meng Wuran to deliver a speech.

469
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,039
Meng, it's your turn.

470
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,759
Mr. Zhang Buchun has been

471
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,359
my close friend for many years.

472
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,599
He has been committed to

473
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,960
supporting the development of culture,

474
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,119
science, education in China for many years.

475
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,480
And he has donated to our Fuhua University.

476
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,039
Because of his support,

477
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,840
the Department of History of our school

478
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,839
made a great discovery

479
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,440
in the archaeology of Xiaotun

480
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,920
in the 18th year of the Republic of China,

481
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,839
which is led and promoted by Professor Jin Zhilie

482
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,440
from our school.

483
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,359
Where is sister Haitang?

484
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,759
Guangzhou Aircraft Factory

485
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,319
produced our first domestic military aircraft.

486
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,680
The test pilot at that time

487
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,960
was the member of

488
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,759
the National Government Aviation Committee,

489
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,799
Mr. Huang Guangrui.

490
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,319
Do you know

491
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,000
who was the person

492
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,519
flew with Mr. Huang Guangrui at that time?

493
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,240
Who?

494
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,720
I think it was Mrs. Song Qingling.

495
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,119
Well done.

496
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,200
The Fuxing is a two-seat trainer.

497
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,200
Today,

498
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,119
we will invite someone to test-fly with Mr. Zhang.

499
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,400
Does anyone here

500
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,480
want to experience

501
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,000
the flight of our domestic aircraft?

502
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,599
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

503
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,359
I do.

504
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Haitang.

505
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,079
I would like to

506
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,860
follow the example of Mrs. Song Qingling

507
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,000
to take part in the test flight,

508
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,119
and challenge the sky together with Captain Zhang.

509
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,519
Okay, welcome.

510
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,720
I think Zhilie will never commit suicide.

511
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,799
Someone must have pressured him,

512
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,039
and it must be because of that thing.

513
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,400
Brother Jin,

514
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,200
could it be that those people

515
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,799
who are secretly following you these days

516
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,640
are coming for oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding?

517
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,720
Yes.

518
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
Now there are indeed a lot of forces

519
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,119
are for the just unearthed inscriptions Wuding.

520
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,039
But according to my analysis,

521
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,160
they should not know

522
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,359
which one of us has it.

523
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,680
So they're just testing it out for now.

524
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,519
But the situation is really a bit critical.

525
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,680
I have an idea,

526
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,000
I hope you two can help me.

527
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,240
What idea?

528
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,640
I want to keep Wuding alone from today.

529
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,400
From today,

530
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,599
we won't contact each other.

531
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,960
From the school's point of view,

532
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
spread a message that

533
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,839
I am the only one

534
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,680
who is studying and keeping the Wuding.

535
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,920
That might confuse them.

536
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,839
If something happens,

537
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,240
I will put it in a safe and secret place,

538
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,799
and leave clues to you.

539
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,160
Zhilie will definitely leave clues here for us.

540
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,920
Let's keep looking for it.

541
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm Meng Haitang.

542
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,880
Miss Meng.

543
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,200
The first time we met,

544
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,200
do you really want to fly with me?

545
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,839
Go through the wind and clouds together,

546
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,260
don't be an unconcerned person in China.

547
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:47,960
What?

548
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,960
Are you afraid to fly?

549
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,980
This is a test flight of a domestic aircraft.

550
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,480
If there is an accident,

551
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,160
you will have to die with me,

552
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,079
aren't you afraid?

553
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,000
Let's go.

554
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,000
The test is not guaranteed

555
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,200
to be 100% successful,

556
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,319
but falling down is 100% guaranteed to die.

557
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,240
It's not too late for you to regret.

558
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,640
To fly or not?

559
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,720
Then fly up later,

560
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,599
don't cry or scream.

561
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,519
Pre-start check.

562
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,039
The engine is good.

563
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,519
Fuel gauge is good.

564
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,920
Brake is good.

565
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,279
Landing gear is good.

566
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,839
Everything works fine.

567
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,200
Ready to slide out.

568
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,079
Take off.

569
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,119
Fly up.

570
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,519
Fuxing is flying up.

571
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,000
It flies straight into the blue sky.

572
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,799
It's flying!

573
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,640
Great! It's flying!

574
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,200
Great!

575
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,599
Open your eyes.

576
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,599
No.

577
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
We fly up,

578
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,279
if you don't open your eyes to see,

579
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,920
don't you just be the one in 100,000 Chinese

580
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,359
flying in the sky for nothing?

581
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,440
So high.

582
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,400
It could be higher.

583
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:20,799
Look,

584
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,200
Fuxing is back.

585
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,200
What's this?

586
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
What does this write about?

587
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,079
How did it run out of oil so quickly?

588
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,400
What did you say?

589
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,480
Nothing.

590
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,000
Let's fly back.

591
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,279
Okay.

592
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,559
How is the wind so strong?

593
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,559
Prepare the emergency vehicle.

594
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,440
Wind shear.

595
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,400
Hold on.

596
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,759
What shear?

597
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,279
I'm going to make a sharp turn

598
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,480
to get out of the low airflow

599
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,640
and make a forced landing.

600
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,640
On my command,

601
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:43,720
bend down immediately,

602
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,000
hold your calves tightly,

603
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,640
and keep your head close to your knees.

604
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,720
Where's the plane?

605
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,160
Fuxing

606
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,550
is experiencing exceptional weather,

607
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,039
Low-level windshear.

608
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,119
Dairong,

609
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,119
what does the wind shear mean?

610
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,079
Is it dangerous?

611
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:08,440
Brother, how do I know this?

612
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,719
Low-level windshear

613
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,439
will cause the aircraft to suddenly slow down

614
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,679
and enter a stall state.

615
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,519
It is how the first pilot, Mr. Feng Ru, died.

616
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,679
Will we die?

617
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,119
No.

618
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,199
Ready,

619
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,519
force landing.

620
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:24,880
Are you okay?

621
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,400
Wake up.

622
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,199
I still have my head.

623
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,679
I still have my head.

624
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,239
I'm scared to death.

625
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,599
Luckily,

626
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,039
you're not scared silly.

627
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,079
You're so bad at it.

628
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,880
I'll never fly on your plane again.

629
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,159
Just sit.

630
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,760
I'll carry you and the plane back to the field.

631
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,679
Carry me?

632
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,800
Aren't you tired?

633
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,280
Do you want me to help you?

634
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,559
Of course I'm tired.

635
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,960
With a girl like you,

636
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,440
the weight is really different.

637
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,480
What do you mean?

638
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,599
You're not strong, don't blame my weight.

639
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,079
The weight is really not right.

640
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,920
Why are you not pulling?

641
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,119
Just wait a moment.

642
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,230
Huansheng and others are coming to pick us up soon.

643
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,679
How will they find us?

644
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,159
Cover your ears.

645
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,719
Let's go.

646
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,400
That's how we'll be found.

647
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,320
You're sweating.

648
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,280
Wipe it off.

649
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,639
Thank you.

650
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,300
The carved tortoise shell

651
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,390
unearthed in Xiaotun, Anyang.

652
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,119
It may come from the pit YH127.

653
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,519
Do you know it?

654
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,800
I've seen its topograph.

655
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,000
But it's a relic from Anyang,

656
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,159
why is it on the plane?

657
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
It should have been managed

658
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,679
by Nanjing Institute of History.

659
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,519
Only a very small amount of artifacts and rubbings

660
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,875
are in the hands of professors
at Fuhua University for the study.

661
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:29,190
- Cultural relics?
- Yes.

662
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:31,880
Captain.

663
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,519
Here they come.

664
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
I will handle it.

665
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,280
Remember,

666
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,840
don't tell anyone.

667
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:45,840
Captain,

668
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,239
Captain.

669
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,480
Are you okay?

670
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,000
What's wrong?

671
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,199
It doesn't matter.

672
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,440
Why don't you wait for the rescue?

673
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,960
Wartime rules.

674
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,360
After forced landing,

675
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,239
must tow the plane to hide.

676
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
Even a test flight can't break the rules.

677
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:03,239
Huansheng,

678
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,480
this Fuxing is also a bit leaky.

679
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,920
When it was forced to land,

680
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,620
there was a problem with the landing gear.

681
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,360
You go back first,

682
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:13,320
leave this to me.

683
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,000
No.

684
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,599
Fuxing must return to the field integrallty.

685
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:18,760
How about this?

686
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,400
Drag it by the car of this road,

687
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,880
when it enters the field,

688
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,960
let it slide into the position.

689
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,920
The oil is still enough.

690
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,039
Right.

691
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,360
If the test flight is like a large rescue,

692
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,599
no one will dare to fly domestic aircraft.

693
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,719
When we come back,

694
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,079
watch it 24 hours a day.

695
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,360
Something is wrong.

696
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,039
Don't let anyone come near it except me.

697
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:43,440
Got it.

698
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,119
When you get back,

699
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,280
take Miss Meng to the hospital

700
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,920
for a check-up.

701
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,960
Since it's a perfect return of domestic aircraft,

702
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,000
then I have to be there.

703
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,519
Back.

704
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,239
Fuxing has returned intact.

705
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,599
Meng.

706
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,519
Fuxing is back.

707
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,360
Captain Zhang Qi,

708
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,559
is this test flight a failure?

709
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,770
What problems did you encounter?

710
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,080
The test flight was forced to land

711
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,350
in emergency weather conditions.

712
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,560
There was a small problem

713
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,960
with the fuel tanks and landing gear.

714
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,560
But our domestic aircraft

715
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,360
is absolutely not inferior to imported aircraft

716
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,760
in terms of performance and handling.

717
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,719
As a soldier,

718
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,519
I think this test flight was a success.

719
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,719
This brave Miss Meng

720
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,199
who flied to sky with me

721
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,840
may have a different feeling.

722
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:14,960
Miss Meng,

723
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,239
what's your feeling?

724
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,159
Miss Meng.

725
