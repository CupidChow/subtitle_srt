What about you?

5
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,280
I'll go along with the aviation school.

6
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,959
I'll see you in Kunming.

Poshan,

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,159
when are you leaving for Kunming?

10
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,959
In this afternoon.

11
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,359
Well...

12

What about Nianqiao?

13
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,599
He'll go with us.

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,959
And we'll be reunited in Kunming, too.

15

All of the Squadron will go?

16
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,120
No. We'll go with only my brother
and Instructor Chen Ran.

The rest of Hanguang Squadron

It's said that a big war is coming.

20

A big war?

21

How big is it?

I can't tell you about the details.

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,800
But the Japanese Army has cruisers.

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,159
And they have a lot more warplanes than us.

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,439
They would not fight only one battle.

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,039
They will fight until...

I'll go back to Jianqiao with you.

29

Jianqiao is now under a martial law.

First,

try our best to blow up enemy carriers
to help defend the fortress.

306

and protect the Battery Huangshan
and Battery Xishan.

309

As most of our main naval ships have been sunk,

00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,559
we're not provided adequate firepower support.

311

So, without reinforcement this time,

Moreover,

314

Jianqiao Airport was blown.

315
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,440
Currently, we can only use Qiaosi Airport

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,559
for refueling.

317
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,920
There's not much fuel left at Qiaosi Airport,

318
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,839
and the staff can't maintain aircraft,

319
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,240
which means we must use our fuel economically.

320

How can we use it economically?

321

You know it yet ask it.

346
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,799
Tell me about your plan.

347
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,880
Our Hawk III Fighters are pursuit planes.

348
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,680
Though they can also bomb,

349
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,079
but we bombed enemy fleets
on August 14th over Huangpu river.

350
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,119
It was not very effective.

351
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,640
Hawk III is only effective
when it bombs at a low altitude.

352
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,839
However, low-level bombing is difficult to accomplish
without ground fire support.

353
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,559
In our squadron,

354
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,440
only the captain can do dive-bombing
below 35 feet with Hawk III.

355
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,640
Yes.

356
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,599
The hit rate with Hawker III is terrible.

357
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,279
Japanese warships are giants.

358
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,680
I'm afraid we won't be enough of a threat to them.

359
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,319
Captain,

360
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,960
I just found that

361
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,880
Qiaosi Airport has a Northrop 2EC in storage.

362
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,880
A bomber?

363
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,640
I had belonged to the bombing brigade

364
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,960
before I joined Hanguang Squadron.

365
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,400
Captain, can you request that

366
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,920
the Northrop be transferred to me?

367
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:36,400
No.

368
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,519
Though the Northrop is a bomber,

369
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,279
neither its machine gun nor its sight works well.

370
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,020
It's hard to defend yourself.

371
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,000
But the load of Hawk III is 227 kilo.

372
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,799
While that of Northrop is 450 kilo.

373
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,599
Twice as much.

374
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,759
The battle is not for self-defense,

375
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,240
but for destroying Japanese carriers.

376
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,519
Captain, larger its load, greater its significance.

377
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:02,920
OK.

378
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,240
I'll send my request at once.

379
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,480
This time,

380
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,079
we fight this way.

381
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,319
Just do as I say.

382
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,799
Don't take the train.

383
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:27,839
It's a waste of money.

384
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,640
And you won't be able to buy tickets.

385
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,559
You can just walk there.

386
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,079
I walked for a full month before

387
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,680
to get to Hangzhou.

388
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,920
Meng Haitang,

389
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,960
if I hadn't saved you today,

390
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,000
you would be blown off.

391
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,680
Thank you.

392
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,720
Yuanyin, you're good at geography.

393
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,680
What's our next stop?

394
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,119
We will get to Fuyang,

395
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,759
and then Jiande.

396
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,000
Then,

397
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,480
let's go to Fuyang first.

398
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,960
If we can buy tickets,

399
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,359
we'll take the train.

400
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,440
If not,

401
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,039
we'll try Jiande.

402
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,720
If we still fail to get a ticket,

403
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,880
we walk all the way to Nanchang.

404
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,200
Maybe we'll have to walk all the way to Kunming.

405
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,519
I'm fine on my own.

406
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,000
But with two ladies,

407
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,240
it will be a tough journey.

408
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,839
I need to get something for you.

409
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,160
The planes lifted off at 10:45 am

410
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,240
on November 26th, 1937.

411
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,759
It's the 19th battle of Hanguang Squadron.

412
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,480
I'm sorry, mum.

413
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,160
I'm not a filial son.

414
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,400
Xu Hanxun, a native of Yancheng,
Jiangsu Province,

415
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,480
bombed an enemy's aircraft carrier,

416
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,119
which was then only slightly damaged.

417
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,039
Hanxun flew his plane into it.

418
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,319
Report, Captain.

419
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,720
New Japanese air fleet spotted.

420
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,480
Repeat.

421
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,359
New air fleet spotted.

422
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,880
The fleet size is eleven.

423
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,359
No, twelve.

424
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:27,200
Captain.

425
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,599
I'm not the leading plane now.

426
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,440
The direction is?

427
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,880
Battery Huangshan, Jiangyin fortress.

428
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,559
Repeat. Battery Huangshan, Jiangyin fortress.

429
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,920
We can fly for 30 minutes.

430
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,720
Take our last time
to cover Battery Huangshan.

431
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,519
Hanguang Squadron! Fight the enemy!

432
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,240
Copy.

433
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,720
Copy. Hanguang Squadron fights the enemy.

434
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,519
At 11:51 am,

435
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,240
Hanguang Squadron fought its 21st battle.

436
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:55,480
Captain,

437
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,599
the fuel tank of 079 was hit.

438
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,119
Repeat.

439
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,799
The fuel tank of 079 was hit.

440
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,720
Captain, I'm unable to parachute.

441
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,119
Repeat. Unable to parachute.

442
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,279
It's stuck.

443
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,359
Zhou Yiwu, a native of Liaocheng,
Shandong Province,

444
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,759
died at the age of 23.

445
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,000
China's air force

446
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,880
is not to be captured.

447
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,119
Yu Kejing, a native of Hangzhou, Jiangsu Province,

448
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,559
was surrounded by Japanese troops
after a forced landing.

449
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,240
He saved the last bullet for himself.

450
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,440
When he was killed,

451
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,000
he was six days shy of his 23rd birthday.

452
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:15,420
[Our bodies, planes and bombs would die with the enemy.]

453
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,799
The fuel of Qiaosi can only fill less than
a third of the tank

454
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,720
for each of the four planes.

455
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,119
We cannot fight.

456
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,680
We'd preserve strength, rather get killed.

457
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,920
Add some fuel to each plane.

458
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,680
Let's try flying to Nanchang.

459
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,279
Captain Zhang!

460
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,160
Captain Zhang!

461
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,799
You'd better leave at once!

462
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,960
We were warned that

463
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,559
Japanese planes are coming to Qiaosi.

464
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,720
We're pulling out, too.

465
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,440
I must hurry to Cao'e River.

466
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,559
Or it will be too late.

467
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,480
Cao'e River?

468
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,599
What happened there?

469
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,000
Cao'e River separates Xiaoshan

470
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,519
and the western section of Xiaoyong Line
on its west bank.

471
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,000
They decided to remove the rails of the railway
finished this month

472
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,599
to keep the Japanese on the other side.

473
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,599
Now the residents are not officially informed.

474
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,680
I must hurry to get my families out.

475
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,039
Have the residents nearby moved out yet?

476
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,160
I'm afraid not.

477
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,920
How can we blow up the bridge

478
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,160
if they haven't got out?

479
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,599
Isn't this leaving them

480
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,640
to the clutches of Japanese?

481
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,920
The river's shallow in places.

482
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,640
Maybe they can wade across the water.

483
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,920
In a few days, the Qiantang River Bridge
will also be blown.

484
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,039
By that time, not only the people in Xiaoshan,

485
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,200
but also the people in Hangzhou can't evacuate.

486
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,440
Captain Zhang,

487
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,599
we left all of the fuel to you.

488
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,599
Fuel your planes and go.

489
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,160
I'll leave now.

490
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,400
Captain, are we leaving or not?

491
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,880
Huansheng.

492
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,960
We must not leave our people to Japanese.

493
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,720
Right. Let's fight them again.

494
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,799
Fight to the end.

495
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,759
To the end.

496
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,200
Good.

497
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,920
Save as many as we can.

498
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,519
Hanguang Squadron!

499
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,680
Yes, sir.

500
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,039
Fight our last battle.

501
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,519
There's no going back.

502
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,799
There's no going back.

503
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,880
Be careful.

504
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,480
Why is the water so cold?

505
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,400
Shall we look for another place

506
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
to get into the river?

507
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,079
They've blown and demolished

508
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,720
as many bridges as they can.

509
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,400
This should be the narrowest place.

510
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,000
The villagers told me

511
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,440
the water's only chest high during the dry season.

512
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,400
Come.

513
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,720
Hold my hand tightly.

514
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,960
Let's hurry across the river.

515
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,799
Be quick!

516
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,720
Run!

517
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,039
Run!

518
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,440
Hide!

519
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,039
Initial observations

520
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,599
suggest that at least 200 people are crossing.

521
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,679
There are seven Type 96 Bombers.

522
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,800
Draw the Japanese planes away from the bank,

523
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,280
as far away as possible.

524
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,760
031.

525
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,239
Our planes are too low on fuel.

526
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,320
And our flight speed is low.

527
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,719
Let's be the bait.

528
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,199
The Japanese are flying low.

529
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,039
This is our chance.

530
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,119
306, 307.

531
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,400
Hide in the clouds.

532
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,599
So they'll think that

533
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,840
there are just two planes.

534
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:41,198
When they go after me and 031,

535
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,440
you send them to death from behind.

536
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,679
031 copy.

537
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,440
306 copy.

538
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,519
307 copy.

539
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,159
At 2:14 pm,

540
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,639
Hanguang Squadron fought its 22nd battle.

541
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,119
Our planes!

542
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,719
They drove the Japanese off!

543
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,599
Cross the river. Be quick.

544
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,119
Hurry up.

545
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,320
Hurry up.

546
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,280
We can go now.

547
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,679
Go!

548
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,920
Yes. Write down what I say.

549
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,039
And publish it tomorrow.

550
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,039
Our air force's strenuous resistance

551
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,400
greatly reduced the chances
and accuracy of the enemy's bombing.

552
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,400
They tried their best to protect the lives
and properties

553
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,639
of the people in Shanghai-Hangzhou area.

554
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,679
They also created conditions
for the evacuation

555
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,639
of people from institutions,
schools and factories in Nanjing.

556
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,159
Yes.

557
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,519
Publish it.

558
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,519
Go for it, Zhang Qi.

559
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Was 019 among our planes just now?

560
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,360
Probably not.

561
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,679
Xuzhou is not their defense area.

562
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,039
But maybe there was 029,

563
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,480
or 039.

564
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
We should go.

565
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:53,639
It's not quite safe here.

566
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,599
307's fuel tank was shot.

567
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,000
307's fuel tank was shot.

568
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,079
Jin Chao!

569
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,320
Jin Chao!

570
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,719
Jin Chao,

571
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,800
a native of Shapingba, Chongqing Province,

572
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,079
sacrificed at the age of 22.

573
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,880
He Yan,

574
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,679
born in Liuyang, Hunan Province,

575
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,159
sacrificed at the age of 24.

576
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,840
307 disintegrated in the air.

577
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,400
306 crashed.

578
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,760
I've run out of fuel. I can't fight.

579
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,480
I've decided.

580
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,199
Me, too.

581
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,239
019 ran out of fuel

582
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,199
and stalled.

583
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,719
I can't hit enemy aircraft.

584
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,519
I'll make a forced landing.

585
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,519
Huansheng.

586
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,400
Huansheng.

587
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,199
No.

588
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,320
No, my leg!

589
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:12,760
My leg's stuck.

590
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,639
I'll help you.

591
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,159
My leg.

592
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,079
I'll wrap it up.

593
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,639
Bear with it.

594
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:17,639
I was just like you.

595
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,280
I wanted to hit them, but couldn't.

596
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,519
I'd run out of fuel.

597
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:26,760
It seems that the god didn't want us to die here.

598
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,360
Huansheng, it seems
that we landed to the foremost position.

599
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,800
Maybe there will be a battle later.

600
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,559
We must leave.

601
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,000
I'll help you.

602
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,639
No.

603
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,599
No.

604
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:49,840
No.

605
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,239
I can't walk.

606
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,440
Leave me.

607
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,119
No. I'll carry you on my back.
