00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,239
Don't shoot.

4
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,239
Ding.

5
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,480
It's been late,

6
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,200
and you're still sleeping.

7
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you need to be fed?

8
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
How vulnerable you are!

9
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,879
And you're a soldier.

10
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,920
I don't know why Haitang likes you.

11
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,439
Get up for the meal.

12
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,079
It hurts.

13
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,799
Mom.

14

Buddy.

15
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,599
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,959
What happened?

17
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,400
Donglai, what happened?

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,000
- Mom.
- Mom.

19
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,199
Why are you calling her mom?

20
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,439
This is my mother.

21
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,439
I'm her own son.

22
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,919
Who are you?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,439
You're awake.

24
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,520
Just get out of here.

25
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,879
Don't stay with my mom.

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,520
Mom.

27
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,840
It's... It's my brother.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,280
When we escaped together two years ago,

29
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,439
we lost him on the way.

30
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,120
I didn't expect that last night

31
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,560
you came home with him.

32
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,199
What a blessing from the god!

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,719
It must be Chunlai.

34
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,639
He knows my wish in the heaven.

35
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,280
So he brought him home with your hands.

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,919
Mom.

37
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,840
My... my brother, what happened to him?

38
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:49,919
Aunt.

39
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,159
Captain, are you here?

40
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,120
It's Nianqiao.

41
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,439
Aunt.

42
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,960
I bought some desserts on the way.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
Which one do you prefer?

44
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,080
I'll buy some more next time.

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,080
Thank you.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,599
Captain, are you alright?

47
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,000
Why do you look so pale?

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,240
Let's go back to the Aviation School later.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,719
Well.

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,319
I came across Haitang.

51
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,319
She's recovering well.

52
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,199
It's no big deal.

53
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,240
She was going to visit you here.

54
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,319
But I stopped her.

55
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,479
I told her

56
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,879
you'll sure go and meet her.

57
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,960
I won't see her.

58
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,000
What?

59
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,000
Why don't you see her?

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,159
Do you know how hard it's been all her way to here?

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,199
She's been holding the sapling

62
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,599
because you gave it to her.

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,280
She missed you so much.

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,000
And you don't meet her?

65
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,199
Don't speak like that.

66
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,319
Listen.

67
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,439
Haitang is my buddy.

68
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,520
If you dare to let her down,

69
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,800
I won't forgive you.

70
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,479
Donglai.

71
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,840
He's your brother's captain.

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,319
How could you talk to him like that?

73
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't be wild.

74
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,360
This is between me and Haitang.

75
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,800
It's none of your business.

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,159
Mom.

77
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,280
When he was sleeping,

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,159
I heard it all.

79
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,319
He told my brother not to shoot.

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,840
He doesn't look like a good guy.

81
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
Well, let me ask you something.

82
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,319
How did my brother die?

83
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,040
It's me.

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
I left him with the Japanese.

85
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,800
What did you say?

86
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,680
Donglai.

87
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,879
Come here.

88
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:30,720
Captain.

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,959
Stop messing around.

90
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,319
Don't touch him. He's injured.

91
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:34,920
Are you okay?

92
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,439
Donglai.

93
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,439
How old are you?

94
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,399
I am seventeen years old.

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,240
Mom.

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,399
Donglai is a grown man.

97
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,639
If you trust me,

98
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,279
let me go out and chat with him alone

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,800
in a man's way.

100
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,959
Let me do something for Ding.

101
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,439
Go.

102
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Don't be wild.

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,519
Go.

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,279
My little boy lost his father in his childhood.

105
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,000
He is a child without discipline.

106
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,000
However,

107
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,759
he has a kind heart.

108
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,439
You'd better persuade Zhang Qi.

109
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,160
Don't take him seriously.

110
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,560
Tell him not to punch him too hard.

111
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,360
Don't worry.

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Captain won't punch him.

113
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,040
They're both my sons.

114
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,959
I'll feel bad no matter who's hurt.

115
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,720
Okay.

116
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,879
Rest assured. Sit down first.

117
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,600
Don't worry.

118
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,000
All right, here we go.

119
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,639
Come on.

120
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,519
Let me deal with you like a man
for my brother and Haitang.

121

I've traveled around.

122
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
I'm not afraid of that.

[Saving the country with aviation]

125
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,399
I have a commemorative coin here.

126
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,920
One side is saving the country with aviation.

127
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,160
The other side is the sun in the blue sky.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,240
I choose saving the country with aviation.

129
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,199
You choose the sun in the blue sky.

130
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,319
No.

131
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
Surely I'll choose saving the country with aviation.

132
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,160
You can't just pick whatever you want.

133
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,800
You're just like your brother.

134

Captain, what are you doing?

135
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,759
To be fair,

136
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,240
you toss the coin.

137
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,040
If it's saving the country with aviation,

138

you can avenge your brother

139

and shoot me.

140
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,399
If it's the sun in the blue sky,

I can shoot you.

142

I volunteered to be shot.

It's none of Donglai's business.

Don't you want to know the truth?

There's only one bullet left for us.

I owe him my life.

170

00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,120
I have only one request.

173
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,200
In the rest of your life,

174
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,279
you need to be a man like your brother.

175
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,039
Behave well.

176
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,440
Shoot me.

177
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,480
Shoot me.

178
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,519
Li Donglai.

179
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,279
Li Donglai.

180
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,399
I don't hate you.

181
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,279
I hate myself that

182
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,759
I can't make my mom proud like my brother.

183
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,000
Donglai.

184
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,720
You're very great.

185
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,320
Your brother is a respected man.

186
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,840
If he was still alive,

187
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,240
he would tell you this way

188
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,159
that men fight for justice,

189
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,120
for your fellow man.

190
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,720
Save the last bullet for yourself.

191
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,919
My brother died without knowing that

192
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,639
he has a useless brother like me.

193
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,960
Your brother told all our buddies

194
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,240
always to stand up straight.

195
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,279
You're his only brother.

196
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,360
He has hopes for you.

197
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,120
My brother left this to you.

198
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,279
Let's go home.

199
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,320
Mom is waiting for us with the dinner ready.

200
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,519
Right.

201
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,279
Go home.

202
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,320
It's really not easy for Aunt.

203
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,240
As soon as the two sons met,

204
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,120
you started fighting.

205
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,000
We didn't fight.

206
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,000
Alright, my fault.

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,720
Let's go home for dinner.

208
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,279
Go home.

209
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,679
Daughter,

210
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,879
why do you climb up so high?

211
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,039
Get down before you fall.

212
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,120
Come on, get down.

213
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,960
Don't get it. Get down.

214
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,000
Mom, I'm Meng Haitang

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,679
who can climb the tree and the wall.

216
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,559
It's easy for me.

217
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,440
Why are you here?

218
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,159
I've seen this bracelet before.

219
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,679
This is... Zhang...

220
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,360
Daughter.

221
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Well, your dad said the other day

222
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,639
a student gave him a letter.

223
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,759
Guess what he wrote.

224
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,320
What?

225
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,039
Your dad said that

226
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,360
he wrote an application

227
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,240
to date Mr. Meng's daughter.

228
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,120
After all, we haven't heard from that boy.

229
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,799
Right?

230
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,399
I'm going to check on my sapling.

231
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:24,879
Haitang.

232
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,240
Haitang.

233
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,240
Mom.

234
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,399
You can rest assured.

235
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,360
Nianqiao and I

236
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,600
will see you in a few days.

237
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,279
Alright.

238
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,639
Take care.

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,639
Bye.

240
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,279
Bye, Aunt.

241
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,039
Bye, Donglai.

242
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,320
Go back.

243
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,519
Let's go.

244
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,399
Take care.

245
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,200
Please stop for a while.

246
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,480
It's you that protected him from death.

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,360
But Nianqiao said that

248
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,399
Kejing's gone.

249
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,759
Ding's gone, too.

250
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,000
He must be very sad.

251
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,080
He must be afraid that

252
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,519
he'd also gone suddenly.

253
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,759
So he didn't want to see me.

254
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,159
Could you please

255
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,799
continue to keep him safe

256
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,120
and bring him back safely?

257
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,879
Nianqiao showed me your letter.

258
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,679
I was wrong.

260
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,780
♫ Red snowflakes bloom in the stormy rain ♫

261
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,940
♫ Journeys far away and the home under banyan tree ♫

262
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,620
♫ The answer of the destiny ♫

263
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,060
♫ Flowing in silence ♫

264
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,060
♫ Go find it and light it up ♫

265
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
♫ Go through winter and summer ♫

266
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,360
Do you remember

267
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,679
the first time I saw you,

268
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,919
I took a picture of you?

269
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,200
You said the pilot

270
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,759
would put the photos taken accidentally

271
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,759
inside the plane as a navigation tower.

272
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,039
I was stubborn then.

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,599
No one would put photos taken by accident

274
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,519
inside the plane.

275
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Actually, at that time,

276
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,480
I wasn't talking about the accident.

277
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,240
I meant

278
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,599
the one I love.

279
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,640
The one you love?

280
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,440
But at that time,

281
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,160
we just met and barely knew each other.

282
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,359
Because the first time I saw you,

283
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,119
I fell in love with you.

284
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,279
As for the bet I made with you,

285
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,839
I was lost long ago.

286
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,720
But Haitang,

287
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,279
I'm a soldier.

288
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,039
I could die at any moment.

289
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,160
But I don't want you to feel sorry for me.

290
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,839
I just want you to stay alive.

291
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,880
I understand.

292
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,119
In fact, along the way to escape,

293
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,960
I'm always at the edge of death.

294
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,480
And I always can hear you calling me.

295
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,880
Could you promise me that

296
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,880
even if you'll die at any moment,

297
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
as long as you're alive,

298
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,480
don't give up on your dreams.

299
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,279
Don't give up me.

300
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,079
Okay.

301
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,799
I promise you.

302
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,680
As long as you're waiting for me,

303
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,240
I can't bear to die.

304
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
[Biji]

305
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,559
Sir.

306
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,960
To No. 17 Justice Road.

307
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,680
Alright.

308
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Sit tight.

309
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,839
Sir.

310
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,759
I think we're going the wrong way.

311
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,920
This is not the way to Justice Road.

312
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,039
Sir.

313
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,240
Sir.

314
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,599
Stop.

315
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,519
Pull over and let me off.

316
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,599
Well.

317
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,119
What do you want now?

318
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,119
Director.

319
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,240
Chief Editor of Xinzhi Times.

320
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,359
Xiao Hongen.

321
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,920
Do you like poetry?

322
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,440
Do you see

323
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,920
the water of the Yellow River from heaven

324
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,880
flowing to the sea and never coming back.

325
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Who are you?

326
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,480
I'm Lu Ziyi.

327
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,839
I love poems.

328
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,680
Li Bai's poems are my favorite.

329
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:51,960
Well.

330
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,640
What do you want from me?

331
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,359
He's insensible and short-sighted.

332
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,160
Here's a chance for you.

333
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,200
You're a member of the government now.

334
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,240
Your newspaper can also be used as a shield.

335
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:13,119
The government needs you to approach Ling Wenyue

336
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:21,440
as Chief Editor of Xinzhi Times
and his old friend's nephew.

337
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,720
Keep an eye on him.

338
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,480
If there's something wrong,

339
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,279
keep me posted.

340
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:28,880
And,

341
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,839
the Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar
that Ling Wenyue is writing.

342
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,880
You have to do something

343
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,599
to delay the writing of it.

344
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,000
No.

345
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,119
Not to delay,

346
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,759
but to keep him from writing.

347
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,920
Do you understand?

348
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,640
Are you ordered by the government?

349
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,880
Then I don't understand.

350
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,119
Why does the government

351
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,799
try to stop a college professor from writing a book?

352
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,279
Mr. Ling's article

353
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,119
will definitely irritate the Japanese.

354
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,599
The war will never end then.

355
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,400
Stopping Ling Wenyue

356
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,519
is to end the war as soon as possible.

357
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,279
No.

358
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,880
I can't do it.

359
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,640
The aim of Xinzhi Times

360
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,920
is to be a newspaper with attitude and dignity.

361
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
As Chief Editor,

362
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,960
how could I betray my human dignity?

363
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,240
Human dignity?

364
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,480
Do you have that?

365
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,519
Not to mention dignity.

366
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,000
Let me help you remember.

367
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,960
As recorded,

368
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,039
Xiao Hongen was born in February 13th, 1911.

369
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,759
In 1928,

370
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,559
he went to the University of Virginia

371
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,960
and studied in the College of Arts and Sciences.

372
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,680
In 1931,

373
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,880
he went to Imperial University of Tokyo, Japan

374
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,400
to study journalism.

375
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,559
In the same year,

376
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,319
He joined a Japanese secret society,

377
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Panlong Society.

378
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,039
Panlong Society

379
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,680
is a Japanese militarist spy society.

380
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,079
Joining the Panlong Society

381
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,759
is an act of traitors.

382
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,480
Do you know what happens to traitors?

383
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,759
I didn't know what the society do at the time.

384
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,400
I thought

385
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,480
it's a revolutionary society.

386
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,839
Whose society?

387
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,759
Whose revolution?

388
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,279
The revolution with whom?

389
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,359
Did you want to

390
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,880
sell our country's information

391
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,039
to the Japanese?

392
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,119
I didn't.

393
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,319
I've never sold our country out.

394
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,519
Director.

395
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,000
Xiao Hongen has a girlfriend.

396
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:58,920
Don't.

397
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,200
Don't... Don't tell Zhenzhu.

398
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,160
Please.

399
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:02,200
I'll listen to you.

400
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,279
I'll do what you asked me, alright?

401
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,799
Such a lover.

402
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,880
Chief Editor Xiao.

403
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,880
Take a look at this.

404
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,400
Keep that in mind.

405
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:24,920
What's this?

406
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,359
Remember.

407
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,000
Help us find oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

408
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,960
Three scratches on the back
of oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

409
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,599
Paint them red.

410
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,300
[Fuhua University]

411
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,200
Cousin.

412
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,319
Cousin.

413
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,200
Zhang Qi.

414
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,119
Slow down.

415
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,480
Are you alright?

416
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,000
How old are you?

417
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And you're still so careless.

418
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,839
Are you hit?

419
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:41,920
I'm okay.

420
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,079
You're not injured, right?

421
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm alright.

422
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,079
Maybe I should change my address

423
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
and call you my brother-in-law.

424
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,559
Don't talk about me.

425
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,640
After I came to Yunnan,

426
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,839
I haven't seen Zhenzhu yet.

427
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Where have you been hiding her?

428
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,920
She couldn't just stay here.

429
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,200
She went to the Burma Road

430
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,359
to take photos of the project.

431
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,000
Cousin.

432
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,720
We're waiting to drink at your wedding.

433
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,839
Sure.

434
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,079
Sooner or later you'll drink.

435
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,720
But your future sister-in-law

436
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,880
has not settled down yet.

437
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,680
Take your time.

438
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,960
Nianqiao.

439
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,559
Captain.

440
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:14,599
Slow down.

441
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,559
Hongen.

442
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,400
What are you doing with Captain?

443
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,519
I was waiting for you to pick me up.

444
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,599
Then I ran into Hongen.

445
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,200
Right.

446
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,279
I'm here to take some pictures.

447
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,519
I'm going to make a report of Fuhua.

448
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,880
By the way,

449
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,839
does any of you know

450
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,240
why is there a line missing in the character Hua here?

451
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,279
Fuhua

452
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,960
means the revival of China.

453
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,559
I took a class of Professor Jin.

454
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,880
He explained that.

455
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,720
But there is a line missing in this school badge.

456
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,839
It was designed by Mrs. Kang.

457
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,200
Qianying.

458
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,319
What does the missing line mean?

459
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,000
Mother said,

460
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,640
the missing line in the character Hua

461
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,079
refers to the invasion of the land

462
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,359
and the shame of losing territory.

463
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,200
She use it to warn teachers and students

464
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,279
to study diligently

465
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,839
and to take the recovery of our land as their own duty.

466
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,920
Hongen.

467
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,839
Today I invited everyone

468
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,440
to a spring outing on Yuantong Mountain.

469
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,799
If you're available later,

470
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,559
let's go together.

471
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,079
I have a big announcement to make today.

472
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,240
What?

473
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:16,279
He kept the secret for a whole day.

474
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Hongen, later,

475
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,720
you ride the bicycle with Haichen.

476
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
We leave a bicycle for Captain.

477
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,000
Captain.

478
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,640
You are not feeling well, ride slowly.

479
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,559
Take your time.

480
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,519
Stop that.

481
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,119
Stop that.

482
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,839
Got it.

483
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:29,799
Alright. Let's go.

484
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:30,240
Let's go.

485
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,160
See you later.

486
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,240
Poshan, take care.

487
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,599
Yuantong Mountain has a steep path.

488
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,519
Don't fall.

489
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,160
Okay.

490
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,519
Hold tight. I'll speed up.

491
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,319
Is it far from here to Yuantong Mountain?

492
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,680
No.

493
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,759
We're almost there.

494
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,519
What a pity.

495
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,240
Nothing.

496
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,400
I said it's beautiful here.

497
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,319
Then, after we beat the Japanese away,

498
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,759
I'll ride you every day.

499
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,119
You are waiting for Zhang Qi.

500
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:00,839
Right.

501
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,119
Why haven't they come yet?

502
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,720
I know that

503
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,960
you are not only worried about Zhang Qi

504
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,839
but you want to give him some time

505
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,559
so he can stay alone with Haitang.

506
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,559
Little Qianying, why do you know so much now?

507
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,599
You're a grown-up now.

508
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,279
I've grown up

509
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,480
when you're not around.

510
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,359
Only you consider me as a child.

511
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,960
I'm eight years older than you.

512
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,000
No matter what, I see you as a child.

513
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,319
My father is eight years older than my mother.

514
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,240
And he didn't consider her as a child.

515
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,720
Qianqiao, do you...

516
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,279
Captain.

517
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,079
Are you okay?

518
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,759
Be careful on slippery roads.

519
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,599
Take care.

520
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,559
Alright.

521
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,559
Poshan.

522
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,880
What's the big secret?

523
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,160
Why can't you talk about it under the mountain?

524
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,119
You asked us to climb up at the noon.

525
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,839
It's exhausting.

526
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,319
I could just get four bottles of rose wine.

527
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,240
Half a bottle for each one today.

528
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,319
Come on.

529
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,720
It's for Captain and Haitang.

530
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:15,519
Come on, buddy.

531
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,839
You and Qianying take this.

532
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,720
Qianying can't drink.

533
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,359
Haichen.

534
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,319
You and Hongen take this.

535
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,880
On the 4th of the seventh lunar leap month, 1938,

536
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,400
Yuantong Mountain is covered
with colorful clouds today.

537
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,319
All the friends here,

538
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,400
be my witness.

539
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,119
I, Zeng Poshan,

540
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,160
formally propose to Miss Xu Yuanyin.

541
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,799
During the war,

542
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,000
I'll take the button on the left breast of my uniform

543
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,240
as the betrothal present.

544
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,680
I'll stitch it on the left breast of the wedding dress,

545
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,319
so it can stay with you.

546
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
I swear,

547
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:00,720
from now on, I will never abandon you.

548
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,000
I'll be with you forever.

549
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,559
Yuanyin.

550
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,480
Do you want to marry me?

551
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,640
Yes I do.

552
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,720
Wonderful!

553
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,440
Everyone,

554
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
please be our witness.

555
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,400
I, Xu Yuanyin,

556
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,480
will live and die together with Zeng Poshan
from now on.

557
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,240
Great, Poshan.

558
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,079
You're so brave.

559
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
If you keep that pace,

560
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,519
your brother is going to be anxious.

561
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,680
Right?

562
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,359
Captain.

563
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
You need to take the move soon.

564
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,119
You're the captain.

565
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,240
I didn't expect that in a blink

566
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,359
Poshan has grown up.

567
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,480
And he's getting married soon.

568
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,920
If father knows the news,

569
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,200
he must be so happy.

570
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,599
He must say,

571
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,839
Nianqiao, you're a kid yourself,

572
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,640
and you always think people are kids.

573
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,920
And there's another piece of good news.

574
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,480
In the new Hanguang squadron,

575
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Poshan was elected to drive the lead aircraft
with the best performance.

576
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,279
Good things come in pairs.

577
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,400
Great!

578
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,519
Wonderful.

579
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,640
The lead aircraft?

580
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,200
Zhang Qi.

581
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,079
Aren't you in the lead aircraft?

582
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,240
How many lead aircraft are there
in the Hanguang squadron?

583
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,759
Captain is still injured.

584
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,720
He stopped flying for now.

585
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,519
I...

586
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
I'll recover soon.

587
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,640
But,

588
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,519
there must be a lead aircraft
in the Hanguang squadron.

589
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,200
Nianqiao.

590
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,559
What exactly about Zhang Qi's injury?

591
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,839
He was shot in the left lung.

592
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,400
The bullet was also pretty close to the aorta.

593
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,079
When Central Aviation Council
found the best doctors

594
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,640
to operate on him,

595
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,640
there's no way to take out the bullet.

596
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,480
Now, the bullet is shifted.

597
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:12,720
If the heart muscle contracts too hard,

598
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,799
the bullet would pierce the heart.

599
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:17,799
But you don't have to worry.

600
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,880
The doctor said that

601
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,960
as long as he doesn't move so intensely

602
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,319
and keep a steady state of mind,

603
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,559
he could live several decades for sure.

604
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:28,759
And he's young.

605
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:31,359
Later, when the medical science develops,

606
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,720
it might not be a problem.

607
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,839
Can he fly then?

608
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,000
The recent training

609
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,119
was carried by me.

610
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
He must be having a hard time right now.

611
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,079
If he can't fly,

612
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:50,000
there's a piece missing in his heart.

613
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,920
I was worried about him the other day.

614
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,480
But fortunately,

615
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,680
he can get you back.

616
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,240
Recently,

617
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,759
he laugh more than before.

618
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,440
Maybe,

619
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,119
it's a good thing for you two if he can't fly.

620
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,679
You don't have to worry about him.

621
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,639
Right?

622
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,360
Though he can't fly,

623
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,519
and he's in poor health,

624
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,119
but at least he can live in peace.

625
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,119
That's kind of a good thing.

626
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,119
Though Poshan is a new pilot,

627
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,159
definitely he's a flying genius.

628
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,320
Right.

629
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,679
Poshan.

630
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,880
When is the wedding?

631
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,559
Kunming is quite peaceful these days.

632
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,039
Do it right away, so you can rest assured.

633
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,119
We think

634
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,119
we should wait for the elders.

635
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,119
After all, Yuanyin's parents are not here.

636
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,159
Well, if so,

637
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,320
your brother couldn't wait
to get your father to Kunming earlier.

638
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,679
That's not a problem.

639
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,960
In my opinion,

640
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,360
let's drink the wine first.

641
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,320
Just get slightly drunk like that day.

642
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,559
Then, we can understand the friendship of gentlemen.

643
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,000
Wait a minute.

644
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,639
I have good news to share with you, too.

645
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Do you and Zhang Qi also...

646
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:15,719
No.

647
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,800
I'll take the popularization of female education

648
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,079
as my ideal for life.

649
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,960
When the term begins,

650
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,239
I'll go to the Normal College.

651
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,199
Hiatang,

652
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,119
but you made a scene last year

653
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,679
even climbing up the tree

654
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,239
just to study archaeology with my dad.

655
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,920
I wouldn't abandon the archaeology.

656
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,480
I'll be like Mr. Ling and Mrs. Kang.

657
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,800
Teaching and learning at the same time.

658
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,760
As for the Normal College,

659
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,079
it's because,

660
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,960
on our way from Peiping to Hangzhou and Kunming,

661
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,960
I met Mr. Fu, who nurtured people with his life,

662
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,920
and so many Chinese people under the gunfire.

663
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,719
It made me realize that

664
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,559
China is big enough

665
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,800
to be measured in a lifetime.

666
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,320
So I figured it out.

667
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,760
To make the country strong,
the people need to be strong.

668
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,800
To make the people strong,

669
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,440
we must have a strong woman in each family.

670
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,440
Women are the next generation of teachers

671
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,960
and also a source of warmth in the home.

672
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,119
So,

673
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,079
I'm going to spend my whole life

674
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,280
to promote and popularize the female education.

675
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,360
Excellent.

676
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,039
That's great.

677
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,079
I used to think you're delicate.

678
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,000
I didn't expect that this time

679
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,280
you not only have the courage

680
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,079
to walk for four thousand miles.

681
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,599
but you've got such a huge ambition.

682
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,360
You're much better than me.

683
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,119
Recalling my life experience at the moment.

684
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,320
Who would understand me while I'm leaning here?

685
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:46,840
Hongen.

686
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,480
I have only seen you once since I came to Kunming.

687
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,039
And it's in a hurry.

688
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,239
I didn't get time to congratulate you.

689
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,159
You've always wanted to start your own newspaper.

690
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,320
Now, the Xinzhi Times is finally set up.

691
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,559
It does not go smoothly.

692
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,280
Before,

693
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,679
we tried to get the qualifications
to run an independent newspaper.

694
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,719
It was canceled later .

695
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,559
I used to think that

696
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,519
as long as I have a pen,

697
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,440
pursuing the truth in a practical way,

698
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,679
I'm sure I can run a good newspaper.

699
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,639
Now,

700
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,559
I'm too naive.

701
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,440
By the way, Zhang Qi,

702
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,760
is there any news for me in the Aviation School?

703
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:27,840
Yes.

704
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,920
I suggested Minister

705
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,559
to take the lesson
from Nanjing and Hangzhou's air strikes,

706
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,000
and design a warning network in Kunming.

707
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,559
Japanese planes are bound to invade Kunming.

708
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,599
Sooner or later.

709
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,639
So how does it warn?

710
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,320
It's just the old-fashioned way.

711
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,679
Build more watchtowers,

712
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,199
and pass the warnings one by one.

713
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,400
Wuhua Mountain is the city center

714
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,360
and it's a highland.

715
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,920
Supervisor Bai built two wooden towers there.

716
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,960
We put lanterns on the top of the tower.

717
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:57,960
Red and green lanterns stand for different signals.

718
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,440
But Kunming is so far from Japan.

719
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,760
Why can't it escape from the Japanese planes?

720
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,760
Because once Japan takes over our military airfield,

721
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,360
they'll surely change it into their flight base.

722
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:09,960
So,

723
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,079
as long as we don't drive the Japanese out of our land,

724
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,440
there will never be peace.

725
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,079
Right.

726
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,559
Those who came from the ground,

727
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,039
we'd fight them back on the ground.

728
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,400
Those who came from the sea,

729
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,679
we'd fight them back in the sea.

730
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,320
Those who came from the sky,

731
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,519
we'd fight them back in the sky.

732
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,719
Then today,

733
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,199
let's become sworn brothers and sisters.

734
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,239
Let's make a wish.

735
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,519
The pilots,

736
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,559
the editor,

737
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:38,400
the teacher,

738
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,679
and the students.

739
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,880
Whoever we are,

740
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,800
we'll establish the friendship of gentlemen

741
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,880
and serve our country.

742
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,880
Don't be a bystander in China.

743
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,920
Serve our country, cheers!

744
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,159
Today is god's blessing.

745
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,760
Last time in Peiping,

746
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,480
Cousin and Nianqiao were not there.

747
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,639
This time,

748
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,800
I suggest we take a picture together.

749
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,840
Great.

750
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,880
Okay.

751
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,320
Haitang.

752
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,360
Captain and I are both busy.

753
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,079
When they get married,

754
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:31,840
please take care of them.

755
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,159
I'll help them with Qianying.

756
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,639
Right, I can help, too.

757
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,320
This car...

758
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:38,880
Zeng Nianqiao.

759
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:40,920
Lieutenant Li.

760
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,320
I finally catch you.

761
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:45,800
Lieutenant Li.

762
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,360
Aren't you supposed to be in Chongqing?

763
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,159
What are you doing here?

764
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,199
I just transferred back to Kunming.

765
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,800
The first thing for me is to catch you.

766
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,360
Catch me?

767
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,960
For what?

768
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,679
Good thing.

769
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,280
Incident in the Pacific.

770
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,440
Dazhong Cinema.

771
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,199
Captain Zhang.

772
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,960
Can I borrow your deputy captain?

773
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,079
Captain.

774
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:11,840
It suddenly occurs to me

775
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,880
there's unfinished duty in the Squadron.

776
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,199
Right,

777
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,119
Haitang and I are going back to Shang Village

778
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,400
to talk with Mr. Ling.

779
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,719
When you finish it,

780
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,679
come and pick me up.

781
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:22,800
Yes.

782
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,400
Cousin.

783
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,480
Come back with us.

784
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,639
Mom said she'd make you dinner.

785
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,920
Okay.

786
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,320
But I have to go back to the office first.

787
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,639
There's a little work to do.

788
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,760
I'll come later.

789
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,039
Okay, we'll wait for you,

790
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,599
Lieutenant Li.

791
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
There's really something to finish.

792
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,960
I'm sorry.

793
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,039
I'll go back first.

794
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,480
This is Donglai's room.

795
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,079
This is Haichen's room.

796
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,840
This is Uncle Zeng's room.

797
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,800
This is my room.

798
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,119
Be my guest.

799
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,239
It's for temporary living.

800
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,840
So it's a little bit untidy.

801
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,320
Isn't this...

802
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:24,960
Wait.

803
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,000
What are you doing?

804
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,639
I picked it up in Anyi.

805
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,519
I'll return it to you.

806
