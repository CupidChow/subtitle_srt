[Defying the Storm]

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,760
[Episode 04]

4
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,920
Sir, something goes wrong.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,519
The shipment of 023 is revealed.

6
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,439
What?

7
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,400
Zhang Qi found the 023 goods after the test flight.

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,439
He handed over one of the boxes

9
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,280
to the Peiping Aviation Defense at Qinghe Airport.

10
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,640
The Aviation Commission will investigate it.

11
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,959
The smuggling of military aircraft,

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,560
is a capital offense.

13
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,000
Clear out inventory.

14
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,000
No evidence should be left for the commission.

15
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,439
It's not easy to do.

16
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,680
Both Fuxing aircraft are filled with goods.

17
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,280
Today one is in Nanyuan and the other in Qinghe.

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,430
And these two boxes were bought with a big price.

19
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,599
If we clear them out,

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
that's going to be a deficit.

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,840
Stupid!

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,000
Loser!

23
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,960
Now those goods are on the tip of their knives.

24
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,039
Or you clear the goods out.

25
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,120
Or you will be cleaned out by others.

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,800
Sir, you led me into the business with the Japanese.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,039
Now that something has happened,

28
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,310
you can't just walk away.

29
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,159
Calm down.

30
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,800
Peiping has not been peaceful lately.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,800
People at the Qinghe Defense Station

32
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,560
was busy with air defense.

33
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,280
Not everyone knows the goods,

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
so they won't take it as a matter of importance.

35
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,039
As for the box in the Qinghe warehouse

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,800
and the two boxes on the plane,

37
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,240
you need to think how to handle them.

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,630
If you handle them well, we won't lose too much.

39
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,960
Do you know how to do it?

40
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,439
Yes, I do.

41
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,280
I'd never miss this time.

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,240
I need to think of an excuse,

43
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,800
otherwise father won't agree.

44
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,120
Okay, just say for military training.

45
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,719
Lanshan.

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,599
Do you really think that

47
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,400
it would have something to do with pigeons?

48
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,840
We've been to the pigeon loft in Professor Jin's house,

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,759
and there is nothing inside.

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,919
Of course.

51
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,560
Professor Jin is not so stupid.

52
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
After the accident,

53
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,240
his home will certainly be searched.

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,390
He is not going to hide something there.

55
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:29,120
So, could his pigeons have another place to live?

56
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,040
Professor Jin is a master of pigeon taming.

57
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,800
His pigeons fly along a fixed route
every morning and evening.

58
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,360
What do you think this has to do with Dan?

59
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,879
The word Dan should refer to the place

60
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,950
where the pigeons fly around at sunrise.

61
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,160
The place to fly around?

62
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,720
Mr. Ling.

63
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,680
Shuan.

64
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,720
Mr. Ling, what are you looking at?

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
Any clues?

66
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,040
How can a person catch up with a pigeon?

67
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,759
That's not right.

68
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,439
Japan has effectively completed

69
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,240
a highly developed industrialized civilization that

having moved away from a monoculture of farming.
[Sina-Japanese Culture Exchange Course]

71
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,800
This is advanced for the whole Asia.

72
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,480
Japan established the concept of

73
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,399
Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere.

74
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,240
I have been faithful to this plan,

75
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,480
and taking the responsibility of advancing it.

76
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,630
I hope through my efforts and those of the scholars...

77
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,560
Haitang.

78
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,399
Why are you here?

79
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,720
I came with classmates.

80
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,510
...to help China and all of Asia

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,120
survive the backwardness and desolation

82
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,800
brought about by agrarian culture.

83
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,430
He's been talking through his hat since the beginning.

84
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,399
Right?

85
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,160
When it comes to the ancient history
of Chinese civilization,

86
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,600
the Chinese believe in the Yellow Emperor,

87
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,879
the Yan Emperor,

[Member of Maochuan Secret Service]

89
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,519
the Xia dynasty, the Shang dynasty and the Zhou dynasty.

90
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,199
But in fact, Yu the Great...

91
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,199
Great Yu Who Controlled the Waters

92
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,190
first appeared in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

93
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,279
But the Classic of Mountains and Seas

94
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,040
is completely absurd legend.

95
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,000
The Classic of Mountains and Seas

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,720
is not entirely fictional.

97
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,360
For example,

98
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,079
the Wind in Four Orientations oracle bone

99
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,360
corresponds to that in the Book of Documents: Canon of Yao.

100
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,279
This proves that

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,680
at least part of the Classic of Mountains and Seas
is true.

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,040
Not only is the history of the Xia and Shang
dynasties false,

103
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,199
but even half of the history of

104
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,759
the Zhou dynasty is also false.

105
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,240
Nonsense!

106
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,879
The excavation of oracle bone inscriptions

107
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,000
is sufficient evidence that the Shang dynasty was real.

108
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,160
What a load of crap!

109
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,510
You can't even count the time of the reign of the kings.

110
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,560
The so-called history of the Shang dynasty

111
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,759
is nothing more than a mess.

112
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,040
The Chinese,

113
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,310
not only do they not know who their ancestors were,

114
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,600
there is no China after Yashan.

115
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,800
Mr. Ling.

116
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,750
Mr. Jin, Jin Zhilie, once gave me the oracle bone
for safekeeping.

117
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,120
I still hope that we can study it together.

118
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,480
You said Professor Jin gave oracle bone inscriptions
of Wuding to you for safekeeping?

119
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,000
Is it possible?

120
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
Yes.

121
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,360
Mr. Jin once told me that

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,360
various parties have been prying at it for a long time.

123
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,190
Therefore, I've been entrusted with the safekeeping.

124
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,870
As an opportunity for cooperation

125
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,160
in building cultural co-prosperity in Asia.

126
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,270
He knows that only by relying on Japan's strength,

127
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,150
we can trace the beginning of Chinese history

128
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,960
and inherit the Chinese cultural lineage.

129
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,759
Mr. Ling.

130
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,030
The world knows you are an expert in oracle bones.

131
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,080
Your book, The Early Oracle Bone Classic,

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
has long been known to the world.

133
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,480
Mr. Okayama.

134
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,670
I have heard some of your arguments since just now.

135
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,270
Frankly, most of it is nonsense.

136
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,159
Please tell me

137
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,799
what Chinese history

138
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,279
needs the help of the Japanese to determine?

139
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,000
Why does Chinese culture need the help of

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,759
the Japanese to promote?

141
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,600
Less than 10 meters from the door,

142
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,320
you can see Dongpo pork

143
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,679
stewing on the pot of an ordinary house.

144
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,600
The rice dumplings we eat on the Dragon Boat Festival

145
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,240
is to pay homage to the sage Qu Yuan.

146
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,679
Even the couplets on the front door

147
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,799
are originated from the classics and history.

148
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,960
Yes, there are so many countries in this world.

149
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,910
As a neighboring country of our country,

150
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,840
Japan is considered as a friend.

151
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,480
The rise of Japan was a catalyst for

152
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,000
the reform movement in our country.

153
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,679
And in the old days, when the war started in Europe,

154
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,799
Japan also had a request for our country.

155
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,159
So it complemented each other.

156
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Our people are most concerned with right and wrong,

157
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,440
righteousness and courtesy.

158
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,080
You just disrespected the Chinese people
and Chinese history.

159
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,320
Mr. Okayama,

160
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,039
I think you need to apologize.

161
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,639
Yes.

162
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,559
You need to apologize.

163
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,679
Yes, an apology is necessary!

164
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,360
An apology is in order.

165
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,440
Apologize!

166
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,720
Apologize?

167
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,919
Why should I apologize?

168
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,360
Yes.

169
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,320
It's true that Japan has admired Chinese civilization.

170
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
But that's long past.

171
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,879
After the Meiji Restoration,

172
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,120
Japan has abandoned China and embraced the West.

173
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,320
Nowadays, it has been the representative of

174
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,240
advanced Asian civilization.

175
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,030
We have left China behind long ago.

176
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,030
We are the ones who are protecting the relics
you can't keep.

177
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,960
The culture you can't pass on is the one
we are carrying forward.

178
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,440
Mr. Okayama, listen to me.

179
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,240
In 1899,

180
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,159
Mr. Wang Yirong, a priest of the Imperial College,

181
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,120
discovered the oracle bone inscriptions.

182
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,600
In 1928,

183
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,910
in Xiaotun, Anyang, Henan Province, China,

184
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,440
a large number of

185
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,360
turtle nails and animal bones with inscriptions
have been unearthed.

186
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
This gives those who study history a great deal to go on.

187
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,559
We can compare the underground artifacts with

188
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,480
the canonical texts left by our ancestors,

189
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,120
to prove the history of Shang and Zhou dynasties.

190
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,840
I am a professor

191
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,679
in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature
at Fuhua University.

192
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,720
I was commissioned by Fuhua University

193
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,960
to write the Study on the Shang Dynasty Calendar

194
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,870
to prove the existence of the Shang Dynasty's calendar.

195
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,200
Now, there is no proof of

196
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,720
when the history of our country began.

197
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,360
I will write this book

198
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,390
to prove it to you and to the world of historiography.

199
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,279
Mr. Ling,

200
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,000
it seems that Mr. Jin does not trust you.

201
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,630
He knows that you are writing the book,

202
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,759
why did he give oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

203
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,240
to me, a foreigner, not to you?

204
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,320
I don't know whether you're telling the truth.

205
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,759
Words are but wind, seeing is believing.

206
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,200
But I know there are many people

207
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,550
with ulterior motives in your country.

208
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,440
By means of low prices,

209
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,240
secret scientific expeditions, and even robbery,

210
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,440
more than a thousand pieces of turtle nails

211
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,279
were taken from our country.

212
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,960
Are these the ways of custody you've mentioned?

213
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,000
Please answer.

214
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,000
Mr. Okayama,

215
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,030
can you answer Mr. Ling's question in detail?

216
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,039
Ladies and gentlemen.

217
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,080
I have the extremely valuable engraved turtle nail,

218
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,679
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

219
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,510
which was excavated seven years ago.

220
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
I have a picture of

221
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,559
the real oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

222
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,600
Look closely.

223
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,960
How does this prove?

224
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,000
It is said that when this artifact was first unearthed,

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,919
it was filmed by Japanese journalists

226
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,120
in an unconventional way.

227
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,159
Is it true that the artifact you mentioned

228
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,910
was handed over to you by a Chinese scholar?

229
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,440
Is it now in China or in Japan?

230
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,639
Can you show it?

231
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,399
Yes, show it.

232
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,559
Ladies and gentlemen,

233
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,879
I hereby solemnly promise that

234
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,360
within a month,

235
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,960
I'll present the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

236
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,519
Uncle Ling,

237
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,159
does he really have it?

238
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:01,960
I don't believe it.

239
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,639
Mr. Okayama.

240
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,720
Show the real thing within a month?

241
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,480
You haven't seen the real thing so far, have you?

242
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,960
As far as I know,

243
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,550
the photo we're showing

244
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,960
is the one that was processed and enlarged

245
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,080
from what our agents photographed

246
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,879
when they secretly infiltrated into Henan.

247
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,870
Are you sure you can present the real thing
in one month?

248
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,200
Originally there was no clue of

249
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,399
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

250
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,720
But today I've caught the big fish.

251
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,150
As the Chinese saying goes,
[Juichi Ando, Chief of the Peiping Provost Guard]

252
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,440
by a lucky chance you may find the lost thing
without even looking for it.

253
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,320
Wu Lingyue must know something about it.

254
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,080
Mr. Ando, you only need to assist me

255
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,879
by sending someone to keep an eye on him.

256
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,639
Okayama Shinichi,

257
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,799
he is a scholar.

258
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Why did he make such a point?

259
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,840
I guess he didn't have good intentions.

260
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,480
Mr. Ling, Miss Meng.

261
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,240
Shuan.

262
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,720
Where are you going?

263
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,559
Go home.

264
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,519
Going home?

265
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,759
Come on, let me give you a lift.

266
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:10,960
No, thank you.

267
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,840
We...

268
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,519
Mr. Ling, come and sit here.

269
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,000
Come on!

270
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,550
You don't need to walk home.

271
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,320
Thank you, Shuan.

272
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,600
Miss Meng, come and sit here.

273
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,799
Thank you, Shuan.

274
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,840
You're welcome.

275
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,480
Hold on to your hat.

276
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,080
Be careful, uncle.

277
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,039
Go easy here, Shuan.

278
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,679
Okay.

279
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
How could it be in the hands of the Japanese?

280
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,960
A man as strict as Uncle Jin

281
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,360
should not give things to others.

282
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,240
Definitely not in the hands of the Japanese.

283
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,200
That makes no sense.

284
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,240
If he has it,

285
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,670
he should have presented the real thing,

286
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,320
but he only had a photo.

287
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,559
Uncle Ling,

288
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,519
is the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

289
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,879
the Japanese said just now,

290
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,960
the same as what the villager mentioned in Anyang?

291
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,759
You're a little girl,

292
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,159
you don't need to care about these things.

293
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,519
Don't ever mention it again.

294
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,200
Mr. Ling,

295
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,639
there's something I've been wanting to ask you.

296
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,759
Shuan, go ahead.

297
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,840
My wife is about to give birth.

298
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,559
We'd like you to think of a name for our kid.

299
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,559
Great, it's a happy occasion.

300
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,080
A good thing, isn't it?

301
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,320
Your last name is Wu.

302
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,270
This is the first child in your family, right?

303
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,039
Yeah.

304
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,519
Then I need to be careful.

305
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
I need more time to think about it.

306
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,399
Sure.

307
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,879
It's a bit blurry.

308
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,240
I'll think of something else.

309
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,799
What the hell is this?

310
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,679
You will think of something else.

311
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,399
As if you have much knowledge.

312
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,320
X-ray diffraction.

313
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,630
The idea is fine, but it can't end there.

314
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,919
Haven't you ever thought about

315
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,480
adjusting the intensity of the peak of the shot?

316
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:54,919
That's right.

317
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,039
I should have asked you

318
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,960
to borrow the physics lab at Fuhua first.

319
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,159
Idiot.

320
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,519
This is at best a half-baked product.

321
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,960
As for your pilot recruitment notice...

322
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,360
Okay, I'll post it on the campus for you.

323
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,159
But you owe me a finished product.

324
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:21,720
Yes,

325
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,279
I will definitely make it up to you later.

326
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,559
Bye bye, Uncle Ling.

327
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:47,799
Miss Meng.

328
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,279
Zhang Qi.

329
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,000
I'd like to have a word with you.

330
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,759
Okay.

331
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,519
I came to see Mr. Zeng.

332
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
What a coincidence to meet you again.

333
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,319
Well.

334
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,160
Your handkerchief.

335
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,319
You don't have to give it back to me.

336
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,359
Tomorrow Fuxing will be back to the warehouse.

337
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,359
I'm going back to Hangzhou.

338
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,110
But I'll be back soon.

339
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,240
There are two addresses here.

340
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,079
One is for Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport,

341
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,960
and the other is for Peiping Nanyuan Airport.

342
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,350
Come and see me if you need help.

343
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,359
Okay.

344
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,319
And this.

345
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,839
Why are you filming me secretly?

346
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,079
You don't like it?

347
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,550
If you don't like it, I'll put it on 019
as a navigation tower.

348
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,799
No, no way.

349
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,400
I want to use it as a navigation tower.

350
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,039
No.

351
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:26,839
Whatever.

352
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,920
But what is the 019 navigation tower?

353
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,839
Well.

354
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,440
The pilots will put the photo of whom they fa...

355
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,400
filming accidentally on the plane

356
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,759
as a navigation tower.

357
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,000
The person in the photo

358
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,110
will see the plane flying in the sky by looking up.

359
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,839
The person in the plane

360
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,750
will find his way home by looking at the photo.

361
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,310
Do you put all the photos taken by accident
on the plane?

362
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,680
Will there be a lot of them?

363
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,200
I have accidentally taken only one photo until now.

364
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,640
I don't think there should be any more in the future.

365
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,039
I want to make a bet with you.

366
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,720
As long as you look up in the sky,

367
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,599
you will think of me.

368
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,240
See you in Hangzhou.

369
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,920
See you in Hangzhou.

370
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,160
Tower.

371
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,279
024 everything is well.

372
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,279
Ready to go.

373
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,119
024 024

374
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,359
The command is cancelled.

375
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,039
What's going on?

376
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,759
The departure procedure is not complete,

377
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,160
you can't leave Qinghe Airport.

378
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,079
I did the departure procedure myself,

379
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,480
how could it be incomplete?

380
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,759
The Aviation Commission revoked the procedure

381
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,920
and stopped the departure.

382
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,830
Deputy Director Lu, do you know what happened?

383
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,279
Fuxing had a serious oil leak accident on test flight,

384
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,720
which almost killed the pilots.

385
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,240
023 had the oil leak accident.

386
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,400
024 everything is well.

387
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,720
This is also the request of the Aviation Commission,

388
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,759
who considered domestic aircraft

389
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,599
don't meet the flight standards.

390
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,960
Deputy Director Lu, Peiping is in a tight spot,

391
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,359
can Fuxing be processed into warehouse

392
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,160
as soon as possible?

393
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,799
You think so highly of the Fuxing.

394
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,400
Are you trying not to hurt the feelings
of President Zhang who donated the planes?

395
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,000
His feelings?

396
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,839
To stop the departure of Fuxing,

397
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,310
trying not to hurt whose feelings?

398
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,839
It's all for the safety of our country,

399
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,240
so why the tit-for-tat?

400
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,200
Well,

401
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,400
I'll send a mechanic to check it out.

402
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,680
It takes only a few days.

403
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,160
After making sure it's okay,

404
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,440
you can fly back to Hangzhou.

405
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,200
How do you like that?

406
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,680
By the way,

407
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,720
Zeng Nianqiao has passed the check

408
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,119
and will return to the team today.

409
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,599
Congratulations.

410
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,480
Go over there and and get registered.
[Registration of National Revolutionary Army]

411

What's your name?
[The 29th Military Academy Corps]

412
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,279
Mazi.

413
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,279
Mazi, good.

414
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,440
How old are you?

415
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,200
I'm sixteen.

416
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,480
Okay, go over there.

417
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,880
Everyone, move forward.

418
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,119
Li Erwa, how old are you?

[Weapon Assignment]

420
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,519
Hello, I'm new here.

421
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,000
The chief told me to come and get my weapon.

422
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,240
This one?

423
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,030
They said that there might be guns tomorrow.

424
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,519
Each person gets one hundred bullets,

425
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,599
and four hand grenades.

426
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,680
Really?

427
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,440
There will be shooting training, right?

428
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,759
Count the numbers, land mines.

429
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,920
There will be ten more boxes after a while.

430
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,079
They are land mines!

431
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,720
Everything is here.

432
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,680
Good.

433
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,240
These will be used tomorrow afternoon.

434
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,640
I'll tell you what to do.

435
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,000
Great.

436
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,079
What is this?

437
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,720
My grandma tied it to me before I left home
to keep me safe.

438
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,920
I got into the eleventh class of

439
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,119
Jianqiao Central Aviation School.

440
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,079
What did you say?

441
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:27,960
You...

442
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:28,920
get into...

443
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,200
get into...

444
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,200
I... I know.

445
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,920
Am I too strict with you?

446
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,279
How about this?

447
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,039
I won't stop you.

448
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:48,960
You can do whatever you want.

449
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,480
I won't stop you, just go ahead.

450
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,319
I joined the air force.

451
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm going to the Nanyuan Airport now.

452
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,759
It's all because of Zhang Qi,

453
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,359
and Zeng Nianqiao.

454
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,319
They don't care about their lives,

455
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,599
and now you are in.

456
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,640
If you join the land force and get hurt,

457
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,759
at least you won't die easily.

458
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,039
Air force?

459
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,920
You might fall to pieces!

460
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,519
So what?

461
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,640
You will say yes if I join the land force?

462
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:17,799
No way!

463
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,079
Poshan,

464
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,480
you don't like me

465
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,400
so you don't want to study physics with me.

466
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,359
But you need to learn something.

467
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,920
To learn Chinese Language and Literature.

468
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,000
Learn history from Mr. Ling.

469
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,550
It'll be great if you become a writer in the future.

470
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:39,720
Stop!

471
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,039
I'm telling you,

472
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,640
you're the first grandson of the Zeng family.

473
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,200
We all count on you!

474
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
How come you, me, and my elder brother

475
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,680
are the only three left

476
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
in a family of dozens of people?

477
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,279
You hated my mother

478
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,880
and you never returned home so you survived.

479
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,640
Nonsense!

480
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,599
I must go into the air force.

481
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,960
I must take revenge for my families' death.

482
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:18,480
How dare you!

483
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,400
I...

484
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,200
I've never hit you ever since we came to the capital.

485
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,880
Today,

486
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,759
I must teach you a lesson.

487
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,200
Want to be a soldier!

488
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,440
Do you still want to be a soldier?

489
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,480
Do you want to be a soldier?

490
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,519
Do you?

491
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,839
You were the one

492
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,680
who posted the Jianqiao recruitment notice

493
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,519
to the school for Instructor Zhang.

494
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,160
How come you don't like it when I join the air force?

495
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,319
You are my son!

496
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,000
What about other people's sons?

497
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,039
Someone else's son should be carrying a gun

498
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
to protect your son, right?

499
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,440
If everyone thinks this way,

500
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,240
sooner or later this country will collapse.

501
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,799
I forbid you to be a soldier!

502
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:52,680
You are not allowed to be a soldier!

503
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,200
My mom...

504
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,200
my grandma...

505
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,279
and my grandpa were killed by the Japanese

506
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,519
on 18th September, 1931.

507
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,510
You just shed a few tears after hearing it.

508
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,799
What about me?

509
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,510
I crawled out of the dead.

510
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,590
My mom was buried by me with my own hands.

511
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,200
Nianqiao and me,

512
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,279
it took us two months to walk to Peiping.

513
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,200
When I close my eyes,

514
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,519
I can still see the earth of the Northeast China

515
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,759
and my mom's face.

516
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,000
You gave me life and raised me for five and a half years.

517
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,279
I won't forget it.

518
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,160
I usually treat you with disrespect.

519
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,839
Today I confess my fault.

520
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,559
I know you want to treat me well.

521
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,350
But what I seek is never a moment of peace.

522
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,880
I want to go back to the Northeast.

523
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,240
I want to go back to see my mom and grandparents.

524
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,079
I dream every night,

525
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,350
Selfheal and Common Peony flowers on the hills.

526
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,799
In a few days,

527
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,270
it would be my mom's 42nd birthday.

528
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,350
She won't like it if her son is a coward.

529
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
Just let me go.

530
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,720
Even if I die,

531
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,079
I will never complain about you.

532
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,119
I've never kowtowed to you before.

533
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,559
I'm afraid I won't have the opportunity to do it.

534
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,119
So I'll do it today.

535
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,559
The sound of gunfire overnight at Lugouqiao
on 7th July, 1937,

536
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,070
started the all-national resistance war.

537
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,799
From then on,

538
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,519
from the Songhua River, to the Great Wall,

539
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,200
from the central plains to the Pearl River,

540
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,960
all compatriots fight in the national tragedy.

541
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,920
The unprecedentedly

542
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,920
great war of national liberation began.

543
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,880
Dad,

544
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,759
it went all night.

545
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,480
Yes.

546
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:44,039
There were gun sounds all night in the south.

547
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,319
Mom,

548
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,200
why are you hanging the quilt on the window?

549
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,720
This is for our security and peace.

550
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,799
The quilt can keep us from random shots.

551
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,880
Can it really work?

552
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,920
Yes, you don't understand.

553
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,200
The elderly said that

554
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,079
during the war of 1900，

555
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,240
Siege of the International Legations,

556
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,920
the quilts were hanged up on every window in the city.

557
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,720
What are you doing here? Go inside.

558
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,119
It's getting late.

559
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,920
Where does Haichen go?

560
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,880
Why doesn't he come home?

561
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,359
What is he doing?

562
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:20,960
Why does he go to the military training

563
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,119
when there are gun sounds everywhere.

564
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,319
He won't go to the south of the city, right?

565
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:24,960
Dad.

566
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,240
Mom.

567
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,400
Haichen told me that

568
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,400
he was going to join the 29th Military Academy Corps.

569
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,319
What?

570
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,039
Join the army?

571
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,799
Why did he join the army at this moment?

572
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,440
All right.

573
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,640
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

574
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,680
Well...

575
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,200
You follow me.

576
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,119
Go and get your younger brother back for me.

577
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,880
Go!

578
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,759
Secretary General Meng!

579
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,759
Secretary General Meng!

580
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,759
Something happened to the school!

581
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,720
Principal Zhou asked me to pick you up

582
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,160
and hurry back to the school for an emergency meeting

583
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,559
to discuss the school's move to the south.

584
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,279
What...

585
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,200
What about your brother?

586
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,640
Look.

587
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,119
Haitang,

588
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,279
go and get your brother back.

589
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,680
Wu,

590
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,039
I'll find my own way to school.

591
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,920
Today, you will go with Haitang.

592
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,680
She's going to get her brother back.

593
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:24,270
The silly boy wants to join the army

594
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,559
when there are gun sounds everywhere.

595
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,720
Do me a favor.

596
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,400
Please.

597
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,039
Don't worry.

598
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:28,839
Let's go, Haitang.

599
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,440
Thank you, and take care!

600
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,400
Take care!

601
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,519
What should we do, dear?

602
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,279
Put it on.

603
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,200
Sir!

604
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,359
The Nanyuan defenders suffered a Japanese pincer attack

605
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,400
to the southeast of their flank.

606
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,839
Minister.

607
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,279
On the night of the 27th,

608
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,839
Japanese troops captured the Tuanhe Palace,

609
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,480
surrounded the 29th Army's Nanyuan Barracks.

610
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,640
Our squadron,

611
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,440
except for the newly received Fuxing 023

612
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,200
which was unable to take off,

613
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,720
031 is with four fifty-three kilogram shells.

614
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,960
024 is in good condition

615
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,680
and does not carry ammunition.

616
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,720
We are requesting 024

617
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,039
to participate in reconnaissance,

618
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,799
031 to support the land force.

619
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,720
Minister, we request to join the war!

620
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:33,799
Sir!

621
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,279
Minister,

622
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,160
the Japanese bomber fleet shows up,

623
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,160
and may join the war.

624
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,319
Zhang Qi, do not meet the battle head-on.

625
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,079
If you disobey the order, you will be shot on the spot.

626
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,039
Minister, I...

627
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,119
Execute the command.

628
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,880
So...

629
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,720
this Fuxing plane, parked at Nanyuan.

630
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,440
If you can't fly it back, blow it up.

631
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,920
We can't leave it to the enemy.

632
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,920
What's going on?

633
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,590
Leave everything behind and run away?

634
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,079
The transporter arrives at five o'clock.

635
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:17,440
The flight takes off at 5:30.

636
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,359
The new flying cadets are on standby.

637
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,720
Haichen?

638
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,480
Listen up, everyone.

639
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,000
The 29th Army,

640
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,880
by 1 a.m. tomorrow...

641
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,640
Meng Haichen!

642
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,920
all evacuate from Peiping,

643
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,400
leaving not a single soldier behind.

644
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,119
If you are willing to go,

645
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,359
leave immediately,

646
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,400
and follow the 29th Army to Baoding.

647
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,279
If not,

648
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,790
take the fees and get dismissed now.

649
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:51,599
Haichen!

650
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,319
Do you want to live?

651
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,920
Get up and go if you want!

652
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,559
Haichen?

653
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,319
Ask one by one!

654
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,640
Haichen!

655
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,279
Hello?

656
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,590
Where is the 29th Military Academy Corps stationed?

657
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,800
Academy Corps? They should still be in Nanyuan.

658
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,599
Nanyuan?

659
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,050
[Nanyuan Barrack]

660
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:47,880
Thank you.

661
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,559
Hello.

662
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,599
I'm looking for the captain of Hanguang squadron,

663
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,280
Zhang Qi.

664
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,360
Captain Zhang?

665
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,840
Yes.

666
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,440
Wait a minute.

667
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,039
Okay.

668
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,719
Miss Meng.

669
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:04,960
Zhang Qi.

670
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:05,920
Why are you here?

671
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:06,880
Zhang Qi,

672
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,670
can you help me find my brother?

673
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,639
Haichen?

674
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,159
Yes.

675
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:10,840
What happened to him?

676
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,150
He must have gone to the 29th Military Academy Corps

677
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,239
since he couldn't get into Jianqiao.

678
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,400
I've heard it's right here.

679
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,559
Can you help me find him?

680
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,639
What should I do?

681
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,320
He is not even eighteen years old.

682
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,079
I'm going to find him.

683
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,840
Meng Haitang!

684
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,880
Up ahead is the battlefield.

685
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,519
The real battlefield.

686
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,719
Fifty minutes before the takeoff.

687
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,760
Here you go.

688
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:42,920
Where are you going?

689
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,280
If I don't come back,

690
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,119
make sure 2214 to take off on time,

691
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,719
and perform bombing range missions.

692
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,480
Please, Ding.

693
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Escort her and evacuate with the transport plane.

694
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,159
Captain, be safe!

695
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,719
Haichen?

696
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,840
Meng Haichen?

697
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,920
Meng Haichen!

698
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,559
Why don't they come back?

699
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,519
Twenty minutes to go.

700
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,599
Okay, I got it.

701
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,199
Ding.

702
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,559
Miss Meng.

703
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,679
We have to leave at 5:30.

704
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,800
Thirty minutes later,

705
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,119
the Japanese would bomb Nanyuan Airport.

706
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,500
[Nanyuan Military Airport]
[Sanhe Town]

707
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,159
You're hurt, don't move.

708
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,199
I'll take you to your sister.

709
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:16,360
Stop!

710
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,119
There are minefields!

711
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,440
We buried the mines the other day.

712
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,440
I recognize it.

713
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:49,440
Haichen, move over there.

714
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,119
Share the weight to the other side.

715
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,440
What did you say to that plane?

716
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:24,580
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

717
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:32,480
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:10,660

00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:18,460
