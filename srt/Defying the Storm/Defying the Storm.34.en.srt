[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
[Episode 34]

3
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,120
What a surprise!

4
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,760
Lieutenant Meng works here

5
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,439
as an instructor of the Youth Army.

6
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,000
Manager Xu,

7
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,599
why didn't you tell me about this before I arrive?

8
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,400
I should have brought Meng

9
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
some gifts if I had known it.

10
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,439
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,319
I only got the news

12
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,199
after arriving at Xiangping.

13
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,039
Hanguang Squadron is dismissed.

14
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,039
Even if the members didn't get to fight,

15
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,360
it's a good thing to get the chance

16
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,159
to train the new recruits.

17
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,840
Carry on.

18
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,719
There will be a chance

19
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,240
to kill the enemy.

20
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,479
I want you to go to Jing'an

21
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,960
and investigate this oil field.

22
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,000
Its ownership,

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,759
change of shareholding and managers,

24
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,639
and the flow of money.

25
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,639
Take this pen with you.

26
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,479
Take a sample of the oil there.

27
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,199
But, Zhenzhu,

28
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm only a journalist.

29
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,199
There's too much for me.

30
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,599
Xiao Hong'en, you're right.

31
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,960
You're only a journalist.

32
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,199
Answer me.

33
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,319
What are journalists good at?

34
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,439
Investigation!

35
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,080
Do you want to live your life like this,

36
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,039
like a puppet, ruining lives.

37
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,479
Don't you ever think about fighting back?

38
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,120
Who's that?

39
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,800
Hong'en!

40
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,240
Why are you here in Xiangping?

41
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,319
I got an invitation from Director Lu.

42
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,759
He asked me

43
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,160
to write some articles about the Youth Army.

44
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,959
How will you write it?

45
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,959
I don't have other options.

46
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,639
You've seen what happened this afternoon.

47
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,439
I didn't expect that

48
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,319
Donglai was registered as Song Zixiang.

49
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,240
I heard rumors

50
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,839
that officers trade the register for money.

51
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,279
I thought the Youth Army would be different.

52
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,600
What makes it worse,

53
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,879
this army is assembled

54
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,720
in the name of resisting the Japanese,

55
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,439
yet the true intention is for civil war!

56
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,160
I think...

57
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,199
We are being followed.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,199
As for Director Lu,

59
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,920
we dealt with him back in Hanguang Squadron.

60
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,360
He was the one

61
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,759
who gave out the order

62
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,560
to kill Zhang Qi.

63
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,079
What about now?

64
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,000
He's become Director of Political Department!

65
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,319
This army is doomed!

66
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,160
Hong'en.

67
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,240
Now that Lu Ziyi invited you here,

68
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,439
I wish you could report the truth.

69
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,079
I hear you.

70
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,439
Let me think about it.

71
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,360
What about you?

72
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,639
Will you stay here as an instructor?

73
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,480
I am disappointed.

74
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,399
But I'm no longer

75
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,199
the deserter I used to be in Beiping.

76
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360
I will not give up my goal

77
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,920
to save the country because of him.

78
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,759
What could you do?

79
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,360
You're on your own.

80
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,040
How will you go against Lu Ziyi?

81
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,759
Mr. Chiand is assembling the Youth Army

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,000
to gain power for his son.

83
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,240
No doubt this army will be handed over

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,839
to Chiang's son.

85
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,199
I understand.

86
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,160
You're hotblooded.

87
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,279
You want to fight against the enemy.

88
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,759
I'm afraid

89
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,480
the cruel reality will put a damper on you.

90
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,040
Haichen,

91
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,959
we're scholars.

92
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,839
There's no way we could win the brutal soldiers.

93
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,800
If you ask me,

94
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,480
you should find an opportunity

95
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,199
and retreat from this camp.

96
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,360
We'll find another way.

97
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,360
I still remember the oath

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,040
the eight of us took in Yuantong Park years ago.

99
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,600
Never stand by and watch.

100
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:25,959
Hong'en.

101
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,639
You're a good man.

102
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,000
But you're too realistic!

103
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,839
That's cowardice.

104
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,399
I didn't want it!

105
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,079
Never mind.

106
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,160
I couldn't explain it to you.

107
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,639
Haichen.

108
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,839
There's something I must tell you.

109
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,759
The Japs have already caught your dad.

110
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,199
What did you say?

111
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,639
It's my fault.

112
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,720
I fell for Lu Ziyi's trick.

113
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,680
Don't worry.

114
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,040
I will rescue him.

115
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,720
Have faith in me.

116
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,360
You like running, huh?

117
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,639
Keep running.

118
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,480
Behave!

119
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,160
Sir!

120
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,319
Captured a deserter.

121
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,439
What's going on?

122
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,040
Sir!

123
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,319
Song Zixiang tried to escape.

124
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,199
And he asked us to leave with him.

125
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,439
I don't know how that is!

126
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,480
Standing here in front of you

127
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,759
is Li Donglai in the flesh!

128
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,879
How much money did you make with my name?

129
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,480
Shoot him.

130
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,120
Yes, sir!

131
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,759
Hold on!

132
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,480
I hate deserters the most!

133
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,240
What a shame!

134
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,600
Director Lu.

135
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,279
It's New Year's Day.

136
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,840
It's unlucky to shoot someone.

137
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,960
I suggest that

138
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,759
we could execute him in public

139
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,600
the day after tomorrow,

140
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,799
on the politic theory class.

141
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,799
We shall use him as a warning

142
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,480
what will happen to deserters.

143
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,200
Good.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,840
Lock him up.

145
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

146
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,919
Are you crazy?

147
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,039
Why did you run?

148
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,039
Two months ago,

149
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,000
I saw a poster at Fuhua University

150
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,639
that the Youth Army is recruiting.

151
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,919
Devote the last blood to defending our motherland,

152
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,600
devote your young blood to the Youth Army.

153
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,679
It sounds so ambitious.

154
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,759
I signed up without hesitation.

155
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,279
My eldest brother, Li Chunlai,

156
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
gave his life for the country.

157
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,279
My elder brother is a hero, too.

158
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,159
My long-cherished wish

159
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,000
is to be like them,

160
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,399
devote my life to our country.

161
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,120
It would be glorious

162
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,679
if I was killed in action.

163
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,120
But since I got here,

164
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,440
I've seen enough

165
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,080
for the last one and a half months.

166
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,080
Didn't you hear

167
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,440
what Director Lu said?

168
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,679
Instructor Meng.

169
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,600
You've seen what I saw

170
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,440
with your own eyes.

171
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,759
And there's Manager Xu.

172
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,440
He doesn't know me.

173
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,240
But I recognize him.

174
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,840
He was the one

175
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,720
who robbed Mr. Ling in the Temple of Yue Fei

176
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,759
in Hangzhou.

177
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,960
Scums like them have gained fame and titles.

178
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,759
Now they lead this army.

179
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
What else could this army be

180
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,600
other than a team of cheaters, rapists, and murderers?

181
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,120
Do you think it's possible

182
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,399
to fight against the Japs like this?

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,879
Actually,

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,039
it doesn't matter

185
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,440
what they call me.

186
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,559
If I could die for my country,

187
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,320
I could live by the name Song Zixiang.

188
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,600
But, it just annoys me

189
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,399
thinking that

190
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,559
these foxes are using us

191
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,799
to kill our fellowmen.

192
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,279
Whatever you say,

193
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,840
you're still a deserter.

194
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,679
You deserve to die.

195
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,279
Go to your brother

196
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,720
and give him the message.

197
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,440
My brother?

198
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,919
Where is he?

199
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,720
Stop staring at the back of my head.

200
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,039
Look outside.

201
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,960
It's gorgeous!

202
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,240
019 is running out of gas.

203
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,279
Stall!

204
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,919
Cannot hit against the enemy's jet.

205
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,679
Forced landing.

206
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,080
Zhang Qi!

207
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,480
Haitang, are you alright?

208
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,919
Why are you still up?

209
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,039
I'm working on the routine tomorrow.

210
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,240
Dreaming about Zhang Qi?

211
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,320
Before I left,

212
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,799
I overheard my parents' conversation.

213
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,799
I didn't get it clearly,

214
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,240
but I guess

215
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,840
my father insisted on coming

216
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,720
because of Zhang Qi.

217
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,960
Before I left,

218
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,159
my dad told me that

219
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,600
Zhang Qi and Nianqiao had a plane crash

220
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,480
a few days ago.

221
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,080
They forced landed in Yemang Mountain.

222
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,720
Aviation School and the plant

223
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,360
haven't heard from them.

224
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,919
But they are not captured by the Japs.

225
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,799
At least there isn't any bad news.

226
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,919
Calm down.

227
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,279
By the way,

228
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,879
although I and two helpers

229
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,840
are here to protect you,

230
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,480
you and Mr. Ling will face

231
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,600
Okayama Shinichi with bare hands.

232
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,399
I'm worried about you.

233
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,120
We're more than grateful to have you.

234
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,039
We shouldn't ask for more.

235
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,159
You'd risk your own life.

236
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,720
Don't say so.

237
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,679
Both you and Zhang Qi

238
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,759
are my close friends.

239
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,120
I ought to help Zhang Qi

240
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,480
protect his beautiful wife.

241
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,120
Zhenzhu.

242
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,120
You and Yuanyin

243
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,039
are my best friends.

244
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,279
You have great power inside you.

245
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,360
You're doing this

246
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
to protect the country

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,039
and save the innocent people,

248
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,639
aren't you?

249
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,399
This time, to rescue my father,

250
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,159
I intended to go on my own.

251
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,639
Desperate as it looks,

252
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,799
I'm 80 percent sure that the plan will work.

253
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,320
That's to say,

254
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,879
if anything,

255
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,720
be sure to protect Mr. Ling.

256
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,840
As for me,

257
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,960
if I can finish this mission,

258
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,039
Zhenzhu,

259
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,200
may I join in your party?

260
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,399
Our country is at risk.

261
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,399
Devote our lives to the country,

262
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,600
and pursue the right cause,

263
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,200
isn't something only for men.

264
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,919
We girls can do it, too!

265
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,120
I'm sure the party will consider it.

266
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,000
Alright.

267
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,559
Go to bed.

268
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,120
We'll travel for tens of kilometers tomorrow.

269
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,399
Mr. Ling and I often go to field study.

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,039
We're used to the long march.

271
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,919
Be sure to keep up.

272
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,879
If I were a man,

273
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
I'd marry you, too!

274
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
But my Zhang Qi will definitely stop you.

275
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,600
You haven't got married.

276
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,960
Your Zhang Qi already?

277
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,360
Don't you feel embarrassed?

278
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,320
What about you?

279
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,480
Do you miss my cousin?

280
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,440
I do.

281
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,119
Hong'en.

282
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,319
We first met

283
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,440
in May, 1927 in Guangzhou.

284
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,279
Back then,

285
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,640
you were a newcomer to the newspaper office,

286
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,640
full of energy and youthful spirit.

287
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Unfortunately,

288
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,640
that year saw too many journalists

289
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,440
died for the words they said.

290
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,240
At that critical moment,

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,480
you told me that

292
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,039
Zheng Zhenduo's letters of protest

293
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
and Guo Muoruo's article

294
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,160
What Chiang Kai-shek is Like Now

295
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,079
shows you the bravery

296
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,119
of Chinese intellectuals.

297
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,039
What about noow?

298
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,640
You're helping the murderers.

299
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,799
They're taking advantage of this dark age

300
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,000
to play up to their cruelty and greed.

301
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,920
Now you're their helper.

302
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,279
That's not what you used to be.

303
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,640
Xiao Hong'en isn't like this.

304
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,960
You asked me

305
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,720
have I ever loved you?

306
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,839
I have.

307
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,559
But the one I love

308
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,440
is the Xiao Hong'en

309
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,920
who keeps telling me about
serving the country worthily

310
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,000
and never give in to the insult.

311
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,240
Hong'en, I'll leave soon.

312
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,000
My life is counting on you this time.

313
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,920
My destination

314
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,960
is up to you.

315
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,759
Before we get into the mountain, the intelligence says

316
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,440
KMT Army's 22nd Division

317
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,200
is the main force.

318
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,200
38th Division, 116th Division

319
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
and 114th regiment march in accordance.

320
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,839
To take down Mongyu,

321
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,559
the army is concentrating

322
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,319
on Miaosi, Wanting, Danba Mountain

323
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,319
and South Baka Road.

324
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,400
Of course,

325
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,119
they will notice

326
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,480
the remnants of the Japanese 56th Division in Lashio.

327
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,240
So, it is very likely

328
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,720
they'll set defense on the road in advance

329
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,240
to stop the Japs reinforcements.

330
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,079
The problem is

331
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,160
the route we found

332
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,440
during our last expedition

333
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
wasn't marked on the military map.

334
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,240
Are you saying

335
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,759
they've found this shortcut

336
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,720
and will reinforce Mongyu through here?

337
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,920
If the Japanese 56th Division

338
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,960
is to reinforce Mongyu,

339
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,759
they will first send out a squad

340
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,839
to scout for the best route,

341
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,240
from Miaoguan to Hongshi,

342
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,440
then to Mongyu.

343
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,400
The situation now is

344
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,079
KMT Army's 13th Division is attacking Namhkam,

345
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,759
22nd Division to Mongyu.

346
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Miaoguan locates between the two places.

347
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,480
As a result, Japs' 56th Division

348
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,400
either reinforce Namhkam

349
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,960
or go to Mongyu.

350
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,079
Will the 14th Flying Corps

351
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
send out scouts to see their movements?

352
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,759
We can't count on that.

353
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,759
It happened once

354
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,240
in Siege of Myitkyina.

355
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,920
The army neglected the importance of scouting,

356
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
didn't see the reinforcements coming.

357
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,880
As a result,

358
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,200
a raid became a long-lasting siege.

359
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,359
Exactly.

360
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,039
The enemy was the Japs 56th Division, too!

361
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,680
That's right.

362
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,279
They're very good at long-range raids.

363
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,599
Unpredictable as they are,

364
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,599
they're the toughest Jap's army

365
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,359
in Western Yunnan.

366
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,880
Although there are only the remnants,

367
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,480
they can still fight.

368
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,799
Before I arrived,

369
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,039
the party assigned me the mission

370
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,160
to secure the counterattack of Western Yunnan.

371
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,440
Right now, our communication is cut off.

372
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,400
It looks

373
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,880
we must make decisions on our own

374
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,680
to stop the Japs' 56th Division

375
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,599
from reinforcing Myanmar.

376
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,200
We must scout as soon as possible,

377
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,079
to find out the movements of the remnants.

378
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,119
If they're going to Mongyu from Hongshi,

379
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,680
we should blow up the road

380
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,880
and slow them down.

381
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,720
But now,

382
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,680
we're on our own.

383
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,400
All we got is my father's lab.

384
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,559
Are you sure we could secure them?

385
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,000
How will we scout and blow the road up?

386
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,279
Can we slow them down?

387
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,160
If the enemy takes this route,

388
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,359
they will find this lab for sure.

389
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,200
We must be prepared to fight.

390
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,799
We need two things.

391
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,000
Gasoline and explosive.

392
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,759
Once we ignite it,

393
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,319
the reinforcement will get here.

394
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,599
I'm sure they know the common sense

395
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,680
to stop the reinforcement.

396
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,119
It's less than 300 kilometers from Jing'an.

397
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,200
My father said

398
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,480
this route is used to transport fuel oil.

399
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,920
I suspect the oil is for Jing'an.

400
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,079
Miss.

401
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,039
The road ends here. You have to walk from here.

402
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:14,559
Are you sure

403
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,680
you don't need us to protect you?

404
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,880
The road ahead is very terrible.

405
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,200
Hide the car near here

406
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,960
and wait for my order.

407
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,319
Yes, miss.

408
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,720
Okay.

409
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,720
Come on, Mr. Ling, Haitang.

410
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,279
Haitang.

411
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,359
Are we heading to Zeng Mu?

412
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:26,799
Right.

413
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,680
After coming to Kunming,

414
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,000
Uncle Zeng and My father

415
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
found this hidden place

416
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,559
in Yemang Mountain.

417
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,680
And they turned it into a lab.

418
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,319
By the way,

419
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,119
all the funds of this lab

420
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,400
come from Supervisor Bai.

421
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,440
But I'm here to save your father,

422
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,880
not to meet Zeng Mu.

423
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,119
Think about it,

424
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,559
the Japs are looking for me

425
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,680
and Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

426
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,720
That's it, I can march forward on my own.

427
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,039
You don't have to go with me.

428
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,759
No, Mr. Ling.

429
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,640
We insist.

430
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,319
It's too dangerous.

431
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:58,920
That's right.

432
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,759
If I can rescue Meng,

433
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,160
I'm willing to do it

434
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,920
at the cost of my life.

435
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:06,759
Uncle.

436
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:08,880
Don't worry.

437
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,599
We will make it back.

438
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,240
Take a break.

439
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,039
Almost there. Almost done.

440
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,480
Take a seat.

441
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,400
Are you alright?

442
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,799
Idiot!

443
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:46,960
It's soil nitrate.

444
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,440
Idiot.

445
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,119
After finishing school for years,

446
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,880
you've forgotten the protocols!

447
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,160
How could you smell nitrate directly?

448
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,240
Come on.

449
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,960
Father, he was hurt in the lung once.

450
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,279
Have some water.

451
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,319
Yunnan is rich of mirabilite.

452
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,039
There are plenty of pits like this one.

453
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,720
It's just we're rather short of time.

454
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,759
If there's enough time,

455
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,359
we can stick to the procedure

456
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,839
by pouring cold water several times

457
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,720
after the hot water.

458
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,039
And repeat it a few times.

459
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,799
The purity of the product

460
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,599
would be much better.

461
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,880
We only applied cold water once now.

462
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:36,839
It's not pure enough.

463
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,759
Why do you need it?

464
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,599
Sir.

465
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,480
I know you're devoted to the lab here.

466
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:48,960
However,

467
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:49,920
you must be prepared

468
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,640
to relocate the lab.

469
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,319
Why is that?

470
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,400
Although the Japs are in Miaoguan for now,

471
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,759
they could march towards here anytime.

472
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,079
It's not safe.

473
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,359
That's right.

474
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,160
Don't worry, father.

475
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,680
Captain and I will help you prepare.

476
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,640
Well, the nitrate here

477
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,240
will be used against those damned Japs, right?

478
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:16,799
That's right.

479
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,960
There's only one road from Miaoguan to Hongshi.

480
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,720
We will scout using Xishan.

481
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,960
Once we find the enemy,

482
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,839
we will bomb the road using B-25

483
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,039
and the homemade bombs

484
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,720
to stop the 56th Division

485
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,559
from supporting Mongyu.

486
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,759
Good idea!

487
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,359
Good for you!

488
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,039
Not bad!

489
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,200
My two planes

490
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,359
are put to full use!

491
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,480
Good for you!

492
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,279
However,

493
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,880
to destroy the path below,

494
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,119
55 kilogram isn't enough.

495
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We need more.

496
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,079
More nitrate.

497
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,680
Once we get back to the lab,

498
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,319
we shall send the students away.

499
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,680
They're valuable physic professionals.

500
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,759
It's too dangerous.

501
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,000
Don't get them involved in this.

502
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,799
By the way,

503
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,559
I should tell you in advance.

504
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,079
In case,

505
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,319
I mean if,

506
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,680
if anything happens to me,

507
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
in emergency,

508
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,599
be sure to save my treasure first!

509
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,160
Don't come to me directly, remember?

510
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,319
Think of it as my will.

511
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:27,720
Father.

512
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,400
Don't jinx it. What are you talking about?

513
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,720
Your life is more precious than money!

514
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,720
That's right.

515
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:33,279
Besides,

516
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,839
what treasure are you talking about?

517
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,720
It's a national treasure!

518
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,160
I can't tell you now.

519
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,400
It's not about money.

520
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,079
Do I have any money?

521
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,279
Come on.

522
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,400
Get back to work.

523
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,119
Sir.

524
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,759
There's another thing

525
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,880
I want to ask you for a favor.

526
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,400
Fuel, right?

527
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,960
Listen up, lad.

528
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:08,480
I have a tung oil workshop here.

529
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,599
It's located near the place I picked you up.

530
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,799
At best,

531
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,200
by tomorrow

532
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:17,279
we could have barrels of tung oil.

533
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,079
Come on, back to work.

534
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,039
Captain, get a new mask.

535
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,640
You were hurt in the lung once.

536
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,839
We've been walking for nearly 2 hours.

537
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,440
It looks like we're going in circle.

538
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,200
How about this?

539
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,960
Mr. Ling, Haitang,

540
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,079
take a rest here.

541
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,279
I'll look ahead.

542
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,960
I'll go with you.

543
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,680
Just stay here

544
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,720
and protect Mr. Ling.

545
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,559
Alright.

546
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,480
Thanks.

547
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,200
It's alright.

548
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,640
Be careful.

549
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,839
Miss Bai has helped us before

550
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,160
in Nanjing Institute of History and Philology

551
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,200
in Beiji Pavilion.

552
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,200
She must be a very good friend of yours.

553
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,799
Zhenzhu is trustworthy.

554
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,559
Uncle.

555
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:55,480
Look.

556
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,039
Is that a strip of cloth?

557
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,359
Looks like it.

558
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:00,759
Hold on a second.

559
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,480
I'll check on it.

560
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:53,500
♫ The shimmering light breaks
through the heavy cloud ♫

561
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,460
♫ Clearing the shelter for remembrance ♫

562
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,920
♫ Everything reminds me of you ♫

563
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,600
♫ You're around me ♫

564
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:14,320
♫ I'm lost in the memory ♫

565
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:22,420
♫ The wind breezes and the time goes by ♫

566
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:27,720
♫ I've been looking for you all the way ♫

567
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:35,380
♫ I made paper airplanes one after another ♫

568
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:43,640
♫ to carry our promises ♫

569
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,860
♫ My remembrance grows wings ♫

570
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,620
♫ and fly to the sky ♫

571
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,460
♫ I'll wait for you at sunset ♫

572
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,460
♫ witness the change of seasons ♫

573
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,920
♫ The wind finally reaches the cloud ♫

574
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,400
♫ And so do we ♫

575
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,580
♫ Our love sustains over the distance and the time ♫

576
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:15,200
♫ We will reunite after the long story ♫

577
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,119
That's my entire plan.

578
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:19,920
Kid.

579
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,759
You fooled me.

580
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:24,440
When you gave me the bone,

581
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,359
I thought it was your homework.

582
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,200
I get homework from my students from time to time.

583
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,039
I had no idea

584
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,559
it is so precious.

585
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,480
This is the trump card you talked about.

586
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,440
Still, I reject your proposal.

587
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,240
Don't you know what Okayama Shinichi is like?

588
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,119
He's a brutal invader.

589
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,839
A young girl like you

590
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,319
goes to him on her own.

591
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,759
Chances are high that he'd harm you.

592
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,599
I'd say so.

593
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,200
If then, Meng is still trapped,

594
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,759
and we'd lose the oracle bone, too!

595
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:52,920
Uncle Ling.

596
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,680
It's not the oracle bone that he's after.

597
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
He's trying to blind us with that false purpose.

598
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,240
What he's really after is you.

599
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,720
He wants your study.

600
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,039
And he wants to have you

601
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,839
support his absurd theory.

602
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,159
Three years ago,

603
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,159
when Zhang Qi handed me

604
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,199
the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

605
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,719
he has figured this out.

606
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,239
Uncle Ling,

607
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,559
the reason why he hasn't turned to you,

608
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,760
is that Okayama has been waiting,

609
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,000
waiting for your study,

610
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,920
especially on the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

611
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,840
He's been waiting and lurking.

612
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,760
Just for the time

613
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,000
where you have almost finished your study.

614
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,239
By that time,

615
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,960
he'd go for Mr. Ling.

616
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,159
That's right.

617
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,599
How does he know about Uncle Ling's process?

618
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,000
Could it be that there's a spy around you?

619
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,679
I don't think so.

620
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,360
Not many people know about my study.

621
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,079
My wife and my daughter,

622
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,199
then there's Meng, Haitang,

623
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,760
and Xiao Hong'en.

624
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,280
From the accident of that traitor student,

625
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,559
then Mr. Jin sacrificed himself to protect the bone.

626
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,320
Clearly,

627
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,920
there are more parties interested in our work.

628
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,920
To save my father,

629
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,679
there's one vital thing to do.

630
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,760
It's about Shang Village.

631
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,239
Ms. Kang and Qianying

632
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,719
must publish the Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

633
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,760
on time to the world.

634
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,360
I think we can count on them.

635
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,199
Lanshan knows clearly

636
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,079
what this book means to me.

637
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,920
I'm sure she will publish this book

638
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,199
within the time limit.

639
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,840
Once it comes out,

640
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,760
then the entire world will know

641
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,679
the true identity of Okayama Shinichi.

642
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,039
He's a liar.

643
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,039
A thief!

644
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,559
He is damned!

645
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,320
The problem now is

646
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,719
whether Ms. Kang can find agencies

647
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,000
to widespread the book.

648
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,480
I've contacted some helpers

649
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,079
for Ms. Kang and Qianying.

650
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,360
In my opinion,

651
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,880
Okayama doesn't know

652
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,199
the current process of Mr. Ling.

653
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,920
If he knew it,

654
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,480
he'd try to stop Mr. Ling from publishing it

655
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,280
at all costs immediately.

656
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,960
Instead, look at what he's doing now.

657
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,679
He wrote us a letter.

658
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,320
He threatened Mr. Ling to show up
by kidnapping us.

659
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,840
That shows that

660
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,159
he doesn't know where Mr. Ling has got.

661
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,239
That's to say

662
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,679
Haitang's rescue plan is genius.

663
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,480
On the one hand,

664
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,199
we try our luck with Mr. Ling and the oracle bone,

665
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,760
to hold the Japs and save Uncle Meng.

666
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
On the other hand,

667
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,679
we buy some time for Ms. Kang

668
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,119
so that we could publish

669
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:26,960
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

670
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,440
ahead of Okayama.

671
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,679
To sum up,

672
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,320
in order to overthrow Okayama's cultural aggression,

673
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,440
it's a risk worth taking.

674
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:35,840
Haitang,

675
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,559
that's praise in disguise!

676
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,599
You're brave and smart.

677
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,400
At the same time,

678
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,679
just like Mr. Ling said,

679
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,760
we must not look down upon Okayama.

680
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,199
He, the Japanese Army,

681
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,440
those traitors inside KMT,

682
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,920
as well as the warlords,

683
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,639
are deeply connected.

684
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,320
All in all,

685
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,480
it's a risky plan.

686
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,639
Damn it.

687
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,039
You two.

688
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,360
Deal with the saltpeter.

689
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,280
We shall teach the Japs a hard lesson

690
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,760
once they get here.

691
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,599
You must be tired from the journey.

692
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,719
There are two rooms behind.

693
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,079
You may unpack your stuff there.

694
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,159
Get some rest.

695
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,360
As for the rescue,

696
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,239
we'll talk about it in detail tonight.

697
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,760
Have some food first.

698
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,079
Sure.

699
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,559
Not in a hurry.

700
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,000
A comrade is on the way.

701
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,639
Comrade?

702
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,679
We're in touch with the party!

703
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,760
Waiting for your messages to know you're safe.

704
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,960
I'm applying to join the army to distinguish myself.

705
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,480
I'm secretary of the underground
communist party branch

706
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,639
of the Central Aviation School.

707
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,039
I'm Zeng Nianqiao, code name Chunjun.

708
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,599
Let me reintroduce myself.

709
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,079
Underground communist from the Beiping branch,

710
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,800
Bai Zhenzhu, code name Chengying.

711
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,960
Hello, Comrade Zhanlu.

712
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,480
Hello, Comrade Chengying.

713
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,119
Comrade Chengying

714
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,920
used to be Comrade Jin Zhilie's liaison officer.

715
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,639
Before Mr. Jin sacrificed himself,

716
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,760
he submitted your party membership application.

717
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,599
He asked me to distract the enemy

718
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,679
and you to protect the oracle bone.

719
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,599
At the same time, he had Chengying

720
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,880
protect the two professors at Fuhua University.

721
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,679
I thought that

722
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,599
having me transfer the bone

723
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:58,280
was a helpless action under emergency.

724
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,880
Now I see

725
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,280
this is a detailed protection plan

726
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,440
operated by our party.

727
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,639
You got it right about Okayama.

728
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,480
The Japs are aware that

729
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,639
they cannot seize the entire land.

730
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,840
Instead, they go after the professors
at Fuhua University.

731
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,760
They want to continue the aggression

732
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,039
using their so-called Study on China.

733
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,360
Robbing the oracle bone

734
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,320
is only a part of Okayama's plan.

735
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,079
His true intention

736
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,000
is to steal Mr. Ling's study

737
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,639
to finish the Counterfeit Calendar of Yin.

738
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,239
And use it to declare his absurd theory

739
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,920
that Chinese characters are imported from the west.

740
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,159
He wants to diminish our self-identity in this way.

741
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Furthermore, to distort our culture

742
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,039
and break our minds.

743
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Mr. Jing cut off all the trails of the oracle bone

744
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,119
at the cost of his own life.

745
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,239
In that way,

746
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:51,559
he diverted Okayama and Lu Ziyi

747
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,199
to look for oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

748
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,440
While they are looking for the bone,

749
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,480
Mr. Ling gets to continue his study.

750
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,639
I agree with Haitang's plan

751
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,719
of handing out the oracle bone.

752
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,639
It can mislead the enemy.

753
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,599
But,

754
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,960
if Ms. Kang doesn't publish the work in time,

755
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,039
Okayama might be desperate about the professors.

756
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,440
That's the hidden danger of this plan.

757
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,320
Captain has a plan.

758
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,280
But it needs our cooperation.

759
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,719
Well.

760
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,000
The two underground liaison officers

761
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,280
have been working for Bai Fei for a long time.

762
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,159
Using that identity,

763
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,119
we could get in touch with Okayama.

764
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,360
Are we there?

765
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,079
Close enough.

766
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
[To Okayama Shinichi, from Ling Wenyue]

767
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
[I and Meng's daughter will trade the bone for Meng.
Meet you tomorrow afternoon in the lab.]

768
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,559
We're here to lead the way for Mr. Okayama.

769
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:27,840
Mr. Okayama.

770
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,880
How can you be sure

771
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,559
that Ling Wenyue isn't setting up a dinner at Hongmen

772
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:35,360
as the Chinese say?

773
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,599
Mr. Juichi.

774
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,159
I'm familiar with Ling Wenyue's draft.

775
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,079
This is his handwriting.

776
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,559
Three years ago,

777
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,119
Ling Wenyue took back his

778
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,199
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar,

779
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:50,280
admitting his mistakes.

780
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:53,119
Clearly, he's an honest and upright person.

781
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,239
Now our country is at risk.

782
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,960
Even if it's an ambush,

783
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,800
we have to give it a shot.

784
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,039
Besides, they're scholars.

785
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,559
We have military power with us.

786
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,480
And we got Meng Wuran here.

787
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,920
I never believe any Chinese.

788
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:16,920
However,

789
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,199
the motor squad finds a shot cut

790
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:23,000
near the place Ling Wenyue mentioned.

791
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,960
It leads to Mongyu directly.

792
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
I've got an order from 56th Division.

793
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:27,920
From now on,

794
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,599
we will set off from Yemang Mountain

795
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,840
to support Mongyu.

796
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,880
We must not let them finish Ledo Road

797
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,960
and the oil pipelines.

798
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,920
I will lead the motor squad

799
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,599
to Yemang Mountain with you.

800
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,639
And we will wipe out those Chinese.

801
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:44,719
Then,

802
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,599
we'll gather up with 56th Division.

803
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,400
I stick to the law that

804
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,119
everything can be solved with guns.

805
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,280
If the guns don't work,

806
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,719
neither with your strategy.

807
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:18,760
Using the excuse that

808
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,239
Haitang and Mr. Ling will hand out the oracle,

809
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,360
we can lure Okayama here.

810
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,360
If everything works out,

811
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:25,599
in two days,

812
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,719
Okayama will get here with Mr. Meng.

813
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,639
By that time,

814
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,599
Nianqiao and I should have finished the explosive

815
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,760
and the fuel oils.
