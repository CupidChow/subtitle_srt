[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,760
I'm going to see

4
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,359
how this mono-alkyl ester biodiesel

5
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,959
will work in warplanes.

6
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,079
Father, that would be great.

7
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,400
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,000
They're here because of you.

9
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,239
Me?

10
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,760
Why is it related to me?

11
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,439
They almost died

12
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,480
in order to clarify your grievances.

13
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,280
You're crazy.

14
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,800
Made yourselves look like this.

15
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,800
Zeng.

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,919
Zeng.

17
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,879
They almost lost their lives for you.

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
You scolded them.

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,560
If you do this again,

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,039
I won't be kind to you.

21
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,360
Did you see me scold them?

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,879
I…

23
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,719
I couldn't be happier.

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,879
Follow me back to Redstone Lab.

25
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll show you one thing.

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,599
Let's go.

27
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,120
Here we are.

28
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,400
Get in the car.

29
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,759
You…

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,510
Kid, you're so badly hurt.

31
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,319
Did you notice that?

32
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:57,919
You…

33
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,400
Father,

34
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,319
is that road already there?

35
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,919
That road was built the year before last.

36
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,199
They said it was built

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,120
to bring fuel in from the south.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,520
It can't be found on the map.

39
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,199
You two get in the car.

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,240
Get in the car.

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,240
Are you really going to Mongyu?

42
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,719
I heard there's a big war going on.

43
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm still in the army.

44
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,360
I'm a three-month veteran.

45
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,950
Of course, I have to go back to the front.

46
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,280
What veteran?

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,439
This little soldier thinks the same as me.

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,599
Yes.

49
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,520
The name on the military card is fake,

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,319
but I,

51
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,770
a student soldier of Fuhua, am real.

52
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,680
I'll go with Mr. Chen.

53
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,319
Okay.

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,240
Take care of yourselves.

55
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,680
Take care of yourselves.

56
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,479
Don't let me lose you.

57
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,879
Don't worry.

58
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,680
Okay, get in.

59
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,439
Mr. Chen, Wang Junyan,

60
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,120
take care of yourselves.

61
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,319
Take care of yourselves.

62
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,959
Colonel,

63
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,519
seven years ago,

64
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,550
I also believed that

65
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,439
with the bravery of our Imperial Japanese soldiers

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,959
and superior weapons,

67
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,959
we could take down the messy and divided China

68
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,839
in just a few days or months.

69
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,040
The battle is not over yet,

70
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,600
the imperial soldiers are still fighting with blood.

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,879
I also believe that

72
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,720
our imperial army will win in the end.

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,160
But the current situation

74
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,959
also confirms my thoughts.

75
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,360
Suffering and death

76
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,759
will only make the Chinese more sober,

77
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,040
and even more united.

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,240
Why are we sinking deeper and deeper

79
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,439
into this war?

80
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,079
There is only one reason that

81
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,920
the Chinese refuse to give in.

82
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,439
What is a country?

83
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,720
A country is not just an entity,

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,560
it also has culture and belief.

85
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,399
Force can destroy the entity of China,

86
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,759
but it cannot destroy their adherence

87
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,480
to their own culture and national beliefs.

88
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,040
To make them obey us completely,

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,079
we have to break their faith,

90
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,519
and make their belief in their own culture

91
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,600
collapse completely.

92
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,720
Mr. Choumei Okawa

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,319
said in Jusenkyo that

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,079
Japan is the center of Asia.

95
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,439
The so-called Greater East Asia Co-prosperity

96
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,240
cannot be said only with guns,

97
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,040
but also be supported by cultural theories.

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,920
Mr. Okayama,

99
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,879
we can't cover culture

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,879
in a few days or months.

101
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,160
Unfortunately,

102
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,839
there is no more chance

103
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,079
to do cultural coverage.

104
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,759
But I still hope that

105
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,839
what you said today is useful.

106
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,160
It will be useful.

107
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,839
Not in the immediate future,

108
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,360
but in the future.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,199
Uncle, are you tired?

110
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:44,759
I'm fine.

111
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,560
In front of you

112
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,990
is the Miao Guan Shang Yue you mentioned.

113
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,199
Look,

114
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,120
over there is the abandoned yard of the farmer,

115
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,879
which hasn't been used for a long time.

116
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,639
It's right there. We'll be there soon.

117
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,519
Okay.

118
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,560
Brother,

119
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,360
take this.

120
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
When you get back,

121
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,519
don't tell anyone we were here.

122
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,000
Got it. Thanks.

123
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,160
Hong'en.

124
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,319
Uncle.

125
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,600
You go back with the guide.

126
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,720
I'll go in myself.

127
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,839
How can I go back?

128
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,360
Do as you're told.

129
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,560
If I'm not back in three days,

130
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,399
tell your aunt that

131
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,680
my family depends on her.

132
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,279
No, Uncle.

133
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,720
Uncle.

134
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,240
Sir.

135
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,879
A Chinese came from the trail,

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,720
and said he had an appointment with Mr. Okayama.

137
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,040
Yes.

138
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,079
Mr. Meng, I didn't expect you to come.

139
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,519
Mr. Ling, did he miss his appointment?

140
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,720
I didn't expect that

141
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,510
Mr. Okayama, who only conducts academic research

142
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,000
and has no political stance,

143
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,440
would make an academic meeting not in the library,

144
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,320
but in this ancient temple in the middle of nowhere.

145
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,990
Professor Ling didn't miss the appointment.

146
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,919
I represent Fuhua University

147
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,720
in all of these matters.

148
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,840
Mr. Meng,

149
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,039
I'm glad you're here.

150
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,840
Mr. Meng, sit down please.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
Bastard!

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,840
Tie him up.

153
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,519
Mr. Ando,

154
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,559
all who come are guests,

155
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
not to mention a scholar like Mr. Meng.

156
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,879
Mr. Meng, there's an old Chinese saying that

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,240
don't lie in front of real people.

158
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,519
I just like that

159
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,120
you are a real person,

160
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,080
not hypocritical and fragile

161
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,759
like many Chinese literati.

162
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,759
Tell you the truth,

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,560
I need oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

164
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,360
And Ling Wenyue's Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

165
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,879
must stop.

166
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,279
But can you do these for me?

167
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,960
Since I'm here,

168
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm sure I can do them for you.

169
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,720
But only if

170
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,720
I see Zhang Qi and Zeng Nianqiao now.

171
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,639
And you promise me that

172
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,639
they will return to the team properly.

173
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,960
You lied to us last time.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,960
You are a discredited person in my eyes.

175
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,120
How can you negotiate

176
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,159
with our soldiers of the Japanese Empire here?

177
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,159
Mr. Meng, as you see,

178
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,159
even this military man knows that

179
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,639
I only want Ling Wenyue.

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Zhang Qi and Zeng Nianqiao

181
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,240
are in my hands.

182
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,240
Don't worry,

183
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,440
they must be safe.

184
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,440
You mean that only Professor Ling

185
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,240
can get them back, right?

186
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,350
I am the secretary general of Fuhua University

187
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,900
and the dean of the School of Chinese Studies.

188
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,799
I have dozens of great scholars

189
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,879
like Professor Ling Wenyue,

190
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,759
and countless intellectual treasures in my hands.

191
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,000
Do you think I am not worthy enough?

192
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,159
Mr. Meng is joking, you are worthy enough.

193
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,799
If you can stand up and point out the errors

194
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,159
in Ling Wenyue's Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar,

195
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,600
hand over oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

196
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,399
pledge allegiance to Japan,

197
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,240
and join hands with me to prove to the world that

198
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,000
Chinese history is only 2,000 years old,

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,990
and that the so-called Three Emperors and Five Emperors,

200
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,720
the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties are all lies.

201
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,799
Then that's enough, Mr. Meng.

202
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,759
Mr. Okayama, I advise you

203
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,360
to stop indulging in your own lies,

204
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,639
which will always be a fantasy.

205
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,039
The 5,000 years of our Chinese history

206
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,320
cannot disappear with your nonsense.

207
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,039
You claim to be a scholar,

208
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,600
but you don't even have the basic spirit

209
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,799
of seeking truth and pragmatism as a scholar.

210
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
You are too ignorant of our Chinese scholars.

211
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,519
Do you think he can scare me

212
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,960
just by talking dirty?

213
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,919
Tell you the truth,

214
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,120
if I can't take these two kids with me,

215
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,200
I don't want to go back alive.

216
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,679
Mr. Meng,

217
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,559
you shouldn't be so selfish,

218
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,519
you shouldn't think like this.

219
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,399
Even if you don't think about yourself,

220
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,159
you have to think about your loved ones, right?

221
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,360
Zhang Qi, Zeng Nianqiao

222
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,080
and Xiao Hongen,

223
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,000
they are all your relatives.

224
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,240
Bring him up.

225
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,200
Uncle.

226
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,240
Hong'en.

227
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,159
Uncle, they didn't hurt you, did they?

228
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,960
With Meng Wuran in your hands,

229
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,910
you don't have to worry that

230
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,279
Ling Wenyue will do anything against you.

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,759
If you're not sure,

232
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,720
let me handle it.

233
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,360
But I have to take this reporter Xiao with me,

234
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,879
he's still useful to me.

235
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,879
I'm sorry, Uncle.

236
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,120
I'm really sorry.

237
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,440
Hong'en,

238
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,590
we're not afraid of making mistakes,

239
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:31,840
but we're afraid of making mistakes again.

240
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,919
Do you remember the text

241
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,799
you memorized most when you were a child?

242
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,679
Editor Xiao, let's go.

243
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,960
Go ahead.

244
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,120
Uncle,

245
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,039
take care of yourself.

246
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,120
Is this the new road that was built?

247
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,240
Yes.

248
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,000
Before it was a detour through Bamo, which was far.

249
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,519
Now we can reach Kunming in five days

250
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,159
via Wanding and Longling.

251
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,559
Director,

252
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,240
the tanker that just passed is ours too.

253
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,080
If the China-India pipeline opens up,

254
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,720
Jing'an's oil will be hard to sell.

255
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,000
Hurry up,

256
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,559
and get as much oil as you can.

257
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,799
Must save this road for me.

258
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,039
Don't worry, sir.

259
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,720
There's no such road on the map.

260
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,039
Comrade Bai Zhenzhu,

261
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,519
let me ask you,

262
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,759
what is the task assigned to you

263
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,590
by our organization?

264
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,360
Where the masters are

265
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,360
is where the Chinese cultural lineage is.

266
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,759
My task

267
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,440
is to protect the professors of Fuhua University,

268
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,720
especially Professors Ling and Meng.

269
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,240
Comrade Zhenzhu,

270
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,000
Zhang Fakui's division

271
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,279
is losing the battle against the Japanese,

272
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,640
resulting in the Japanese army to go further west,

273
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,679
and have occupied Dushan in Guizhou.

274
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,000
Although the Japanese army was afraid of

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,270
going too far into the interior,

276
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,300
which would be unfavorable,

277
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,400
they withdrew from Dushan.

278
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,759
But it is not clear

279
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,000
whether they will turn to attack Kunming.

280
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,039
So the situation now

281
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,720
is very serious for us.

282
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,520
The organization asked us

283
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,960
to establish a reliable fighting base

284
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,890
in the southwestern countryside as soon as possible,

285
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,850
to deal with the possible

286
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,039
Japanese attack on Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan,

287
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,399
as well as future major domestic events.

288
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,840
Major domestic events?

289
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,639
I also learned something about the KMT

290
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,120
through my father Bai Fei.

291
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,399
Because of the American intervention,

292
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,159
the Chongqing government now

293
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,559
proposes to renegotiate with our Party.

294
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,399
But it was clear that

295
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,000
Chiang was not very sincere about

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,799
our proposal for a democratic coalition government.

297
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,159
In view of the current domestic war situation,

298
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,519
the KMT army

299
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,200
has made strategic planning mistakes

300
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,159
and tactical failures,

301
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,000
resulting in defeats

302
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,280
in the battle against the Japanese.

303
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,400
In response to the Japanese invasion,

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
our party's policy is to retake

305
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,640
wherever the Kuomintang had lost.

306
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,400
Let's take back

307
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,880
wherever the Kuomintang has lost.

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,680
Yes.

309
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,519
Now the Mongyu counter-offensive

310
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,640
on the Burma border is about to start.

311
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,559
The organization will send

312
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,990
two underground communicators with you

313
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,000
to carry out the task.

314
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,599
Okay, come down.

315
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,440
Come here.

316
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,119
Come on, from here.

317
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,279
Look.

318
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,920
Look.

319
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,960
Look.

320
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,680
Look,

321
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,480
this is the engine lab.

322
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:51,799
Professor.

323
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:52,920
Okay.

324
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,519
How is it?

325
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,240
Is this the flight lab

326
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,160
that Uncle Meng built for you?

327
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,400
Don't give all the credit to Meng Zhongtang.

328
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,279
There's also the money from Supervisor Bai.

329
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,079
This place may be small,

330
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,720
but it has everything I need.

331
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,480
And

332
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,039
it's built underground,

333
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,000
so it's safe.

334
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,400
Sir, is this a turbo engine?

335
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,880
Inlet,

336
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,599
combustion chamber,

337
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,920
turbine and tailpipe.

338
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:39,960
This is a heat engine.

339
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,519
The principle of its work

340
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,839
is to input energy at high pressure,

341
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,440
and release it at low pressure.

342
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,160
Yes.

343
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,960
Captain.

344
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,079
Isn't that the Tsiolkovsky formula

345
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,720
you wrote before?

346
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,920
I used it.

347
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,519
Is it possible

348
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,640
to add a gassing combustion chamber?

349
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,799
What did you say?

350
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,039
Between the turbine and the tailpipe.

351
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,640
To increase the thrust,

352
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,519
we have to increase the temperature

353
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
and boost ratio,

354
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,200
which will consume a lot of kinetic energy.

355
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,400
Fuel consumption will be frighteningly high.

356
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
But over the years,

357
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,279
you have been thinking about this,

358
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,359
and have been studying tung oil.

359
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,279
Captain,

360
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
you have also been thinking about

361
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,039
turbo engines over the years.

362
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,920
That's why you worked

363
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,319
as a mechanic for three years, right?

364
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,880
By the way, father,

365
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,960
these are the materials of the latest foreign models

366
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,680
I have collected over the years,

367
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,279
check if they are useful.

368
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,759
So many.

369
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,400
Yes.

370
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,799
And these are the captain's.

371
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,759
We took great pains to bring them here.

372
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,240
The design of my imaginary turbine engine.

373
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,160
Please mark my papers again.

374
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,920
What paper?

375
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't even know

376
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,319
who I am now.

377
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,680
I've been playing Zeng Mu for half my life,

378
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,519
I can't play anymore.

379
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,920
I used to think about recovering my name.

380
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,400
Since Poshan died,

381
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,079
I realized that

382
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,759
it doesn't matter what my name is.

383
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,440
What matters is that

384
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I am now the life of Chinese physics,

385
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,559
and I am a fighter of physics.

386
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,519
As long as I can make out this turbine engine,

387
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,240
I will die without regret.

388
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,240
My father's half-life wish was

389
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,599
to publish academic articles with his real name,

390
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,000
and return to Hailun City with his own family name

391
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,960
to pay tribute to my mother and the Zeng family.

392
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,440
That's not important.

393
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Zhang Qi,

394
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,920
after knowing my life,

395
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,160
do you think I'm a despicable impostor,

396
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,519
and let you down?

397
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,319
Forget it.

398
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,279
I'm disappointed.

399
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,990
I'm disappointed that you have abandoned the lectern,

400
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,000
and your students, who treat you like brother or father,

401
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,759
to hide in the mountains,

402
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,740
seemingly thinking about your past,

403
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,279
but in fact adding to the wrong.

404
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,279
No matter what your surname is,

405
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,200
you are still a great scholar.

406
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,240
You has spent half of your life teaching.

407
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,319
I know that you have a burden in your heart.

408
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,400
The crash of Xishan,

409
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,960
and Poshan…

410
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,880
Over these years,

411
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
you must have calculated countless times.

412
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,519
Knowing that you have not miscalculated,

413
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,519
it's more important

414
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,400
to account to the real culprits

415
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,599
to pay tribute to Poshan

416
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,960
and the relatives in Hailun City.

417
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm not discouraged.

418
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:57,880
Sir,

419
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,279
how can you be discouraged?

420
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,160
Father.

421
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,119
Father.

422
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,119
Great.

423
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,359
Great.

424
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,440
No matter your surname is Zeng or Qin,

425
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,079
you are always my teacher.

426
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,640
Come on.

427
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,480
Do you know what this is?

428
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,240
Xishan.

429
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,519
Didn't expect that, did you?

430
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,990
The day after the Xishan was decommissioned,

431
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,799
I asked Minster to give it to my father.

432
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,559
That's nothing.

433
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
Come on.

434
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,519
Come here.

435
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,200
Wait a minute.

436
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,920
Wait a minute.

437
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,400
Look at this.

438
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,319
My father left in anger,

439
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,400
and everyone knew that.

440
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,000
So Haitang proposed to let him

441
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,460
take oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

442
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,319
out of Fuhua.

443
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,319
I agreed with her.

444
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,240
Haitang's idea.

445
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,000
The girl has grown up.

446
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,799
You're really responsible for this period of time.

447
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,559
Don't mention it.

448
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,079
Responsible?

449
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,319
Didn't your Haitang

450
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,799
take it with heavy responsibility?

451
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,200
Your teacher took it

452
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,160
and you are so polite.

453
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,720
Listen,

454
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,359
no one can hide anything better than me.

455
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Sir, that's not what I meant.

456
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,640
Guess,

457
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,519
what's that thing?

458
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,240
Do you know it?

459
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,400
It's

460
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,799
B-25.

461
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,359
Right.

462
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,480
I asked the Nine Factory for it.

463
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,680
I want to study how to change the engine.

464
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,160
I've changed it

465
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,960
to a honeycomb frame,

466
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,359
which can hold 25 55-kilogram bombs,

467
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,759
or two 500-kilogram bombs.

468
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,319
Father,

469
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,839
where did you get the bombs?

470
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,160
They're all fake,

471
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,119
just for show.

472
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,359
So the Xishan is empty too?

473
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,119
Yes, just for show.

474
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,599
It's a pursuit plane,

475
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,000
without any bombing function.

476
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,720
Besides,

477
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,400
the model is too old to be upgraded.

478
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,920
Then, can it still fly?

479
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,400
What do you mean?

480
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,559
Do you think I'm here

481
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:37,319
to play with specimens?

482
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,359
Both planes can fly,

483
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,720
they just don't have fuel.

484
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,480
What do you think?

485
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm a little worried about that road today.

486
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:56,759
Road?

00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,359
Chinese have been turned from rejection to submission

511
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,839
of Western culture,

512
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,680
and from arrogance to inferiority

513
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,359
of their own culture.

514
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,799
China's former fate was in diplomacy,

515
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,759
but its future fate

516
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:08,960
will be in domestic affairs.

517
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,750
The Chinese Nationalist Party

518
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,440
is the general organ of the country

519
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,920
that leads revolutionary construction,

520
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,759
and is the only revolutionary party in China.

521
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I can't read it.

522
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,119
No wonder Meng said

523
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,359
it was nonsense to

524
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,920
publish such a work as a national leader.

525
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,359
Wuran is right.

526
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,759
Chiang Kai-shek wrote The Fate of China,

527
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,319
which is like openly declaring war

528
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,920
on the Communist Party.

529
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,480
It's worrying.

530
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,079
Come in.

531
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:47,920
Dad,

532
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,559
there's a telegram for you

533
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,480
from the school concierge.

534
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:51,839
Telegram.

535
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,580
[Telegram from Okayama Shinichi]

536
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,400
Oh, no.

537
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,279
Something's happened to Wuran.

538
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,079
I knew something bad would happen.

539
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,079
He didn't let me tell you.

540
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,240
He told me to keep it a secret.

541
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,279
He said he was afraid of delaying Mr. Ling's book.

542
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,359
What should we do now?

543
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,839
What should we do?

544
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,920
Aiju, don't worry.

545
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,400
The Japanese have been afraid of

546
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,100
the release of Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

547
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,559
Now the book has not been published,

548
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,720
and Ling has been here.

549
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,119
So I believe that

550
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,720
Meng will be fine for now.

551
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,640
I'm going to exchange Wuyan back now.

552
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,359
The person they want is me.

553
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,200
No.

554
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,000
Mr. Ling, you can't.

555
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,920
Meng went there for you.

556
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,240
Dad,

557
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,000
I'll go with you.

558
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,759
How can you go there?

559
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:48,680
You're just a kid.

560
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,400
There's a bus to Longling in the afternoon.

561
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,680
When I get there,

562
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,759
I'll find a way to change the bus

563
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,440
to Miao Guan.

564
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,880
Neither of you can go.

565
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,200
Okayama Shinichi's intention

566
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,279
is very clear.

567
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,200
He uses Meng as a threat to stop you from

568
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,850
publishing Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

569
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,160
The reason why Meng went to Western Yunnan for you

570
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,990
is also because of Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

571
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,319
Which is more important,

572
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,400
don't you know?

573
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
The publication of Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

574
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,930
can be delayed.

575
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,759
But the life of Meng is at stake.

576
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,640
Meng Wuran has been protecting us

577
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
like a hen for so many years,

578
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,640
I can't let him risk his life because of this.

579
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,380
We'll save Meng.

580
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,680
And Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

581
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,039
must be published on time.

582
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,079
Let me go to Hongshi for you.

583
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,440
Okayama wants me.

584
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,920
Then I'll go with you.

585
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:31,680
You…

586
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,440
Qianying,

587
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,400
the publication of Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

588
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,519
is over to you and Haitang.

589
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:39,119
Remember not to delay for a day.

590
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:42,799
Haitang.

591
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:44,759
Aunt,

592
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,079
you stay and publish

593
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,260
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

594
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,559
Uncle Ling, I'm going to Western Yunnan with you.

595
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,559
Why are you here?

596
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,279
Mom.

597
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,559
Did you find out what happened

598
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
to Zhang Qi and your father?

599
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,559
Zhang Qi? What happened to him?

600
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,839
You can't go.

601
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,279
When your father left,

602
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,440
I knew he was determined to sacrifice.

603
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,599
He is trying to protect Mr. Ling and you.

604
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,880
If you go there,

605
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,799
would he die in vain?

606
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,160
It's okay, don't worry.

607
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,400
Three years ago,

608
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,680
Zhang Qi was prepared.

609
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,640
Don't worry,

610
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,440
I'm the only one who can save dad.

611
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,680
Haitang,

612
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,480
there is one thing I have been worried about.

613
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,400
Although the Japanese seem to be

614
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,410
closely robbing oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

615
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,640
But I think that is only a cover.

616
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,640
Their purpose is not simply

617
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,920
to rob a cultural relic.

618
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,039
Over the years, I have learned one thing.

619
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,500
Oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding are important,

620
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:57,480
but the people who study it are more important.

621
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,279
Whether it is Mr. Kang, Mr. Ling,

622
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,200
or Mr. Meng and Uncle Zeng,

623
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,400
they are the treasures of the country.

624
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,920
The biggest role of oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

625
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,400
in this troubled world

626
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,910
is to protect the nation's cultural lineage.

627
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,519
Mr. Jin set this up before.

628
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,359
When these professors

629
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,820
who study the origin of Chinese culture

630
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,000
are in trouble,

631
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,799
then start this plan.

632
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,839
I will keep oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

633
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,559
You just go to Western Yunnan,

634
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,990
and find out what happened to the Xishan.

635
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,990
Oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding is not lost,

636
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,519
I hid it in a safe place.

637
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,240
Okayama has been conspiring

638
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,300
to promote cultural invasion.

639
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,075
Robbing oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding
is just a cover.

640
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
His real purpose is to

641
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,319
prevent Mr. Ling from publishing

642
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,510
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

643
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,880
Uncle, let me go to Western Yunnan with you.

644
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,759
Now it's time to

645
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,200
make them suffer from their own scheme.

646
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,599
No, you can't go.

647
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,359
I don't know anything about

648
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,240
what you're talking about.

649
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,000
I only know that

650
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,330
the people who went to Western Yunnan

651
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,640
are not sure of their lives now.

652
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,240
It's okay.

653
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,000
I think

654
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,920
we should turn to the government for help.

655
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,559
Mom.

656
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,640
What do you think?

657
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:07,839
Everybody's here.

658
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,480
I'll accompany Mr. Ling and Haitang

659
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,239
to Western Yunnan.

660
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,679
Be careful.

661
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,199
Qianying, listen to your mother at home.

662
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,679
Bring them all back safely.

663
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:25,639
All right.

664
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,400
Don't worry.

665
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,679
Good girl, Qianying.

666
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,280
Lanshan.

667
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,960
Be careful.

668
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,639
Be safe on the road.

669
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,039
Auntie, take care of yourself.

670
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:41,880
Wait for me.

671
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,159
I'll go.

672
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,280
Dad, be careful on the road.

673
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,159
Mom,

674
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,880
they will come back safely.

675
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,320
Yes.

676
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,119
They will come back safely.

677
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,199
But the Japanese have already taken Guizhou.

678
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,960
If we don't win the battle in Western Yunnan,

679
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,679
we'll be attacked on both sides.

680
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,440
If the Japanese really attack Kunming,

681
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,159
what should we do?

682
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,800
We Chinese have the backbone.

683
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,599
Since ancient times,

684
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,380
the emperors have guarded our country.

685
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,039
Isn't the Dianchi Lake at our door?

686
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,239
Sacrifice to show our will.

687
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,510
Mom, but I think that Chinese scholars,

688
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,600
before choosing to sacrifice calmly,

689
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,510
should fight until their last breath.

690
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,039
Young people like you do have

691
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,119
more courage and wisdom than me.

692
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,119
Okay,

693
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,199
let's fight the battle of

694

Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

695
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,280
Never give up

696
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,639
until the moment of victory.

697
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,760
Miss Zhenzhu,

698
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,840
you have been protecting me and Zhang Qi.

699
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,320
This time,

700
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,690
we still trouble you to suffer with us.

701
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,519
Don't you want to invite the enemy into your trap?

702
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,480
After that,

703
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,239
you, Mr. Ling, and Mr. Meng,

704
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,840
you may not be able to catch him.

705
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,440
Of course I have to help you.

706
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,239
In fact, you also protected us in Beiji Pavilion.

707
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,519
I often feel that

708
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,639
there is an inexplicable power behind you.

709
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,199
If I'm not wrong,

710
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,639
a strong faith has been supporting you, right?

711
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,559
Miss Zhenzhu,

712
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,800
I also want to be like you.

713
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:37,960
Haitang,

714
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,719
we are good friends.

715
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,320
Of course we should solve problems together.

716
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,760
You can go to Western Yunnan calmly

717
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,119
to cooperate with Zhang Qi's plan,

718
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,800
which means you don't have to be like me.

719
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,920
I believe you will only do better than me.

720
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,159
Mr. Ling,

721
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,559
I asked my dad to send us to Longling

722
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,800
by a transport plane first.

723
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,920
This is the fastest way.

724
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:03,960
Thank you.

725
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,320
As long as we can

726
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,840
get to Miao Guan as soon as possible.

727
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,280
But the Japanese 56th Division

728
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,880
is stationed near Miao Guan.

729
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:12,559
I don't think

730
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,990
we should throw ourselves into the net.

731
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,079
It seems that we need more help.

732
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,000
There's someone you'd like to see.

733

[Xiang Ping, the temporary station of Youth Army]

734
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,320
I am the new director

735
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,519
of the political department of our youth army.

736
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,119
Today is also the first time

737
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,719
to meet with you all.

738
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,920
There are some things

739
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,960
I need to tell you as the director.

740
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,079
You have performed well recently.

741
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,000
Director Lu is very satisfied.

742
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,800
Director Lu invited you to Xiang Ping this time

743
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,679
because he wants to use your writing skills.

744
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,559
Meng Haichen is one of the instructors of the youth army.

745
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:59,039
He was transferred from the Air Force

746
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,280
to teach land-to-air defense theory.

747
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,920
You personally introduced Meng to the Japanese.

748
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,119
The photos were taken.

749
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,559
You're smart,

750
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:15,039
so I'm sure you wouldn't want to

751
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,710
expose yourself in front of Instructor Meng.

752
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,639
When the report of Youth Army is finished,

753
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,679
you can go back to Kunming.

756
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,559
and fight for our country.

757
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,920
The most important thing for our youth army

758
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:41,280
is to serve the Party and the country
wholeheartedly and firmly.

759
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,320
Japan is now a spent force.

760
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,679
We're bound to fight with the Communists.

761
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,079
So, you must be prepared

762
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,840
to fight the Communists to the death.

763
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,840
After this training,

764

the best of you will be sent to India by air

for further training,

766

so that you can become cadres of the Youth Army
