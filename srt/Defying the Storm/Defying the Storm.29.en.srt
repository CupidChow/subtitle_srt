Where was I?

11

Excessive airspeed may generate oil vapor

00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,719
and block the oil circuit.

Yamada is right.

Because Study on the Yin Dynasty
Calendar is published,

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,959
he is anxious.

69
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,319
So he deliberately came to

70
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,639
make trouble with you.

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,040

from beginning to end.

73
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,360
It's quite rigorous.

there's something I don't understand.

78
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,400
Is it because there is a different way

79
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,530
to write the words Xing Shuai Xi

80

on the oracle bones,

81
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,800
that the Japanese

82
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,480
did not recognize it as Xing Shuai Xi?

83
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,040
This is the most common way

84
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,439
to write Xing Shuai Xi on oracle bones.

85
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
This Xing is interesting,

86
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,959
it looks like three torches.

87
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,480
What about word diviner that Japanese mentioned?

88
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,120
Diviner.

89
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,959
I know how to write Ding.

90
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,800
Look.

91
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,279
These are already deciphered and recognized.

92
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,320
Uncle Ling.

93
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,000
Uncle Ling,

94
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,759
I suddenly thought of something.

95
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,519
The oracle bone scholars believe that

96
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,919
the drill, chisel

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
and burn marks on the oracle bones

98
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,279
were used by diviner for divination,

99
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,240
so they believe that the oracle bones

100
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,590
were used to record divinatory words.

101
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,759
But since I made the turtle shell myself before,

102
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,360
no matter how,

103
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,470
I couldn't make the pattern

104
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,100
exactly the same.

105
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,519
Because the pattern is random every time.

106
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,279
Pattern?

107
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,480
Yes.

108
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,320
If it's random,

109
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,679
here will be millions of patterns.

110
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,720
Then how to divine?

111
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,720
Go on.

112
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,559
So

113
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,480
could the accepted theory of divination

114
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,240
not necessarily be correct?

115
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,080
Haitang,

116
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,440
don't ask if you don't know.

117
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,480
You're not good enough,

118
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,600
don't show off here.

119
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,159
I think Haitang has a point.

120
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,440
But she shouldn't talk nonsense.

121
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,360
Meng,

122
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,560
a scholar should look at problems dialectically,

123
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,840
and have the ability to question authority.

124
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,360
Do you remember the time

125
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,879
when the sceptics denied the ancient history?

126
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,039
All the ancient history textbooks

127
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,639
in our university were changed overnight.

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,720
Until the 25th year of the Republic of China that

129
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,520
when a major archaeological discovery was made,

130
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,080
corresponding to the Chronicle of Yin

131
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,380
in the Records of the Grand Historian,

132
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,340
that it became clear that

133
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,480
the history of Shang dynasty was real.

134
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,230
Many universities changed their textbooks

135
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,540
just before the start of classes.

136
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,679
This is the study in the midst of exploration.

137
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,320
So what Haitang said may not be right,

138
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,799
but her mode of thinking is worth encouraging.

139
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,600
Uncle Ling,

140
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,120
Okayama said that

141
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,200
if you can't deliver oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

142
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
then your Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

143
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,500
will not be valid.

144
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,399
In fact…

145
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,879
Let me think about it.

146
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,639
What you said makes sense.

147
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,000
075 report your flight altitude.

148
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,120
Altitude 4,000.

149
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
075 pull up to formation altitude.

150
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,519
075 pull up.

151
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,150
Xishan is one fighting against nine.

152
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,200
It won't last long.

153
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,679
075 pull up.

154
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,720
Death is nothing.

155
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,120
Xishan's left wing was shot.

156
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,799
Underwing radiator was shot.

157
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,279
Engine cowl was shot.

158
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,399
What's he doing?

159
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,960
The Chinese are going to crash the plane.

160
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,559
Get out of the way.

161
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,799

I'll pull up to 20,000.

174
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,080
When Zero is overloaded,

175
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,320
its engine may fail.

176
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,679
When I pull the dive,

177
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,300
you find a chance to shoot it down.

178
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,679
Can your radiator hold up?

179
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,919
Just shoot them down.

180
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,440
We've shot down a Zero.

181
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,200
Shot one down.

182
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,039
Great.

183
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,919
075 duration of ten minutes.

184
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
075 return.

185
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,240
Repeat.

186
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,159
075 return immediately.

187
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,440
No matter how powerful an opponent is,

188
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,240
he must have his weaknesses.

189
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,919
The weak point of the 96 Land Attack 22

190
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,679
is at its tail gun.

191
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,879
This is its blind spot.

192
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,559
We can enter from the back at a negative height,

193
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,820
and chase the rear of the enemy

194
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,000
from bottom to top.

195
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,039
The Chinese pilot has escaped.

196
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,850
Another 96 Land Attack has been shot down.

197
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,000
Great.

198
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,000
Great.

199
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,120
Great.

200
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,440
Great.

201
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,399
Great.

202
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,200
We won.

203
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:00,720
We won.

204
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,080
Minster,

205
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,039
three of us fought against 11 in this battle.

206
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,519
With the help of floating bombs,

207
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,240
we shot one Zero fighter,

208
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,720
and three 96 land attackers.

209
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,270
We successfully drove away the aircraft group.

210
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,159
One of our Hawk III was damaged.

211
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,919
Okay,

212
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,879
report to Chongqing.

213
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,840
Yes.

214
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,159
Great.

215
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,080
So great.

216
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,960
Finish the conference first.

217
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,679
Talk about the rest later.

218
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,159
Mr. Ling,

219
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,799
let's get back to the topic of the conference.

220
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,679
A work like Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

221
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,960
has been long awaited by our Chinese.

222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,660
It is no less important than the warplane

223
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,360
that just took off to fight with the enemy.

224
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,360
Likewise,

225
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
it hits hard at cultural invaders

226
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,240
who try to reverse black and white.

227
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,240
That's right.

228
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,399
Good point.

229
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,100
On behalf of the financial community,

230
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,200
I am donating to Fuhua University today.

231
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:04,960
I…

232
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,679
President Hu.

233
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,039
Sorry,

234
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,720
I have to say something first.

235
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,039
Everyone,

236
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
you all know that

237
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,080
Ling Wenyue,

238
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,200
I am a scholar.

239
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,159
What I have pursued in my life

240
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,960
is the freedom of being a human being

241
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,120
and the rigor of being a scholar.

242
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,879
I have to tell you that

243
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,120
if the three characters Xing Shuai Xi

244
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,919
are not found in the same expression

245
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,399
on oracle bones and bronzes,

246
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,120
then this single argument cannot stand.

247
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,360
Mr. Okayama Shinichi's question is right.

248
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,840
I'd like to apologize to everyone.

249
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,000
I am sorry.

250
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,519
Please give me some more time.

251
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,599
But now I have to announce that

252
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,920
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

253
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,240
will be discontinued.

254
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,279
What Professor Ling means is that

255
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,079
there are some minor omissions in the book,

256
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
- but it doesn't affect…
- Meng,

257
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,240
you are also a scholar.

258
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,680
If the basic argument fails,

259
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,000
the book should be overturned.

260
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,640
Ling Wenyue!

261
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,200
You should support me!

262
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,160
Father.

263
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,759
President Hu.

264
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,680
Supervisor also left.

265
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,759
Mr. Ling,

266
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,279
you really never lie in your life.

267
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,599
Thank you.

268
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,920
Father,

269
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,960
I think Uncle Ling is right.

270
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,519
Uncle Ling,

271
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,799
I support you.

272
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,119
[Ta Kung Pao]

273
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:30,799
Director,

274
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,119
Zhang Qi just won a big battle.

275
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,759
I'm afraid it's hard

276
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,200
to take Zhang Qi away from Minster Tang.

277
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,079
It's not that easy

278
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,559
for Zhang Qi to become an air war hero.

279
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,039
We have to step in this matter.

280
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,960
I asked you to look into Ding Huansheng,

281
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,039
find out the information.

282
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,200
I'll report the situation to Aviation Council.

283
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,160
Yes.

284
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,640
41,

285
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,319
42,

286
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,400
43.

287
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,839
Captain,

288
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,839
019 got 43 shots.

289
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,559
These bullet holes are its medals.

290
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,279
What's wrong?

291
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,400
We successfully wounded enemy planes
in the first battle,

292
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,359
why are you still so upset?

293
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,039
Actually,

294
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
I was trembling in the cabin that day.

295
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,960
Trembling all the time.

296
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,000
I couldn't stop it.

297
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,119
If Nianqiao hadn't told me to fight again,

298
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,279
I might have turned around and run back.

299
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,519
It's your first fight.

300
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,079
It's normal to be scared.

301
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,480
It's not my first time.

302
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,279
In Nanyuan I…

303
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,720
I…

304
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,240
If you hadn't come to save me that day,

305
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,519
I would have been dead.

306
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,839
Then why did you come to the aviation school?

307
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,839
I want to be a hero,

308
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:33,279
just like Poshan and you.

309
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Do you know

310
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,240
what it was like when I flew 019 for the first time?

311
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,319
The Hawker III sold to China at that time

312
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,599
was an obsolete model.

313
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,839
I didn't expect that

314
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,200
the first time I flew it

315
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,319
the landing gear wouldn't retract.

316
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,759
If Ding hadn't piloted me that day,

317
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,759
I might have fallen to death.

318
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,599
Then I would have been ill.

319
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,880
I couldn't touch the plane for half a month.

320
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,880
I vomited when I touched it.

321
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,200
Very badly.

322
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,839
You were afraid of flying.

323
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,440
Then what happened?

324
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,799
Then Ding was anxious.

325
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:22,839
He blindfolded me,

326
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,990
took me to the top of the mountain,

327
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,240
asked me to jump down

328
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,000
and said I had to fly if I didn't die.

329
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,799
At that time, I thought

330
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,990
it was inevitable that I would die,

331
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,640
but I didn't expect that

332
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,790
there was a lake at the bottom of the mountain.

333
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,279
Nianqiao also used this trick on me.

334
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,720
So there is no hero.

335
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,160
Some people can survive from death,

336
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,119
but definitely not because they are not afraid.

337
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,559
Instead,

338
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,440
heroes cherish lives.

339
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,160
But they do not cherish their own lives,

340
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,039
but more people's lives.

341
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,640
On the 17th,

342
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,079
you could fight for the land under your feet,

343
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,039
and for the people around you.

344
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,079
Meng Haichen.

345
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,799
Captain, don't worry.

346
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,200
I'm out of it.

347
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,599
The people on the ground are counting on us.

348
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,359
By the way, Captain.

349
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,359
I just went to Wujiaba,

350
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,799
and heard a mechanic say that

351
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,319
Uncle Zeng asked him

352
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,759
for the wreckage

353
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,240
of the fuel tank of the Xishan yesterday.

354
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,759
Zhang Qi, Meng Haichen,

355
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,440
this is Deputy Director Shao of Aviation Council.

356
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,559
He is here to give important instructions

357
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,880
on the air battle on November 17th.

358
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,160
On November 17th, 1940,

359
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,079
Zhang Qi, captain of Hanguang Squadron,

360
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,799
Deputy Captain Zeng Nianqiao,

361
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,000
and team member Meng Haichen,

362
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,680
without superior's order to fight,

363
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,470
disobeyed orders to take off and fight.

364
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,039
It violates the provisions of Article 27 and Article 47

365
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,100
of the War Military Law of the Republic of China

366
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,920
and the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

367
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,240
Captain Zhang Qi

368
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,839
even detained his superior officer

369
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,960
in the tower.

370
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,680
His behavior was outrageous.

371
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,519
By the order of the Military Law Division

372
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,720
of the Republic of China Aviation Council,

373
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,000
detain Zhang Qi, Zeng Nianqiao

374
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,079
and Meng Haishen.

375
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,279
Soon to be sent to military court for trial.

376
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,279
Captain Zhang,

377
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,759
doesn't this scene look familiar today?

378
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:58,480
Director Shao,

379
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,480
is there a misunderstanding?

380
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,880
Three of them fought against 11 enemies.

381
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,799
They attacked and wounded four enemy fighters.

382
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,039
It is a great victory.

383
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,839
Why are they sent to a military court for trial?

384
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,119
Minster Tang,

385
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,160
what was the Aviation Council's order

386
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,559
for the Air Force Officers' School?

387
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,039
I have the record here.

388
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:24,240
The order you gave that day

389
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,480
was to order 075 to return immediately.

390
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,559
This 075 was Meng Haichen's plane.

391
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,319
Besides,

392
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
Zhang Qi requested

393
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,559
Hanguang Squadron to take off.

394
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,480
Your answer was that

395
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,880
the two Zeros were still there.

396
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,359
You rejected the request.

397
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,920
I haven't missed a word of what I said, have I?

398
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,519
Lu Ziyi, you...

399
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,839
I disobeyed the order alone,

400
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,759
it has nothing to do with Minster or anyone else.

401
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,759
Not only the captain,

402
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,559
but also me.

403
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,960
And Zeng Nianqiao.

404
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,720
Take them back first.

405
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,640
When we find Zeng Nianqiao,

406
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,990
take them into custody together.

407
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,599
Uncle Ling,

408
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,610
by combining two rubbings together,

409
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,070
is it possible to find the oracle bone inscriptions

410
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,470
that were lost because of the rupture?

411
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,200
Yes.

412
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,079
I'm looking for the same expression of Xing Shuai Xi

413
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,480
in oracle bone and Jin inscriptions.

414
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,599
But, Dad,

415
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,319
the history department of Fuhua

416
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,510
doesn't have all the rubbings.

417
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,599
What if it's not in these rubbings?

418
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,680
So,

419
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,079
your mother went to Chongqing.

420
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,200
I applied to the Institute of History and Philology

421
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,400
to make copies of all the oracle bone
and bronze inscription rubbings,

422
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,200
and bring them here.

423
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,000
It's a big project.

424
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,400
Uncle Ling,

425
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,640
I'll help you with conjugation after school.

426
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,200
Not just conjugation.

427
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,640
The calculation of the Yin calendar

428
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,880
is very complicated,

429
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,519
with more than 20 digits,

430
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,000
and not just once,

431
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,319
but repeatedly.

432
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,880
I wonder

433
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,400
if we should set up a special math group.

434
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,200
I'll ask Uncle Gao from the math department for help.

435
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,720
He made a hand-cranked calculator,

436
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,519
which I heard is much faster than an abacus.

437
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,680
Yes.

438
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,240
How about setting up an astronomical group?

439
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,920
Take out all six calendars

440
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,990
in the history of our country

441
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,519
for mutual textual research.

442
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,640
Okay.

443
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,799
That's a big deal.

444
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,200
We can't even calculate it

445
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,480
until my father's hairs turn gray.

446
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,319
I'll get some students to help your father.

447
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,900
Many people have great power.

448
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,440
Qianying,

449
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,480
let me test you.

450
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,079
What is this character?

451
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,319
Do you know it?

452
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,559
It's fly.

453
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:38,759
Look.

454
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,359
Doesn't it look like two wings?

455
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,720
Dad,

456
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,359
it was so exciting

457
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,759
when Nianqiao they fought in the sky.

458
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Many of my male classmates

459
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,880
said they wanted to join the army like them.

460
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,119
Dad,

461
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,839
I'm thinking of changing my department.

462
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,440
I want to switch from physics to aerodynamics.

463
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,279
I want to help Nianqiao and others

464
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,359
fix their airplanes in the future.

465
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,720
You're always talking about Nianqiao.

466
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,480
You can't change your major

467
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,559
because of Nianqiao, can you?

468
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,880
Are they all here?

469
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,559
Yes.

470
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,480
Come in.

471
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,680
- Nianqiao.
- Uncle Ling.

472
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,200
- Haitang.
- Talk of the devil and he comes.

473
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,839
You're here.

474
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,599
I'm here.

475
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,720
Nianqiao, what are you doing here?

476
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,480
I'm going to visit my father

477
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,160
to get the altitude test of floating bombs.

478
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,240
And I come to see you on the way.

479
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
To see my master.

480
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,440
I'll go with you.

481
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:39,720
Uncle Ling,

482
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,319
can I take Qianying to see my father?

483
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:43,960
Let's go.

484
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,279
Qianying,

485
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,160
I often dreamed of your laughter just like that.

486
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,200
Nianqiao,

487
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,720
do you know why my father

488
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,200
allowed you to take me to see master?

489
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,720
Maybe he wants you

490
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,920
to supervise my father to eat.

491
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,200
No.

492
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,920
He doesn't eat well himself,

493
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,079
I even have to supervise him.

494
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,480
Then maybe he thought

495
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,640
it was too noisy in the storeroom.

496
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,880
No, it's not.

497
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,920
Then I don't know.

498
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,920
My dad doesn't object.

499
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,279
He's not against me liking you.

500
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,480
Qianying,

501
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,720
fighting in the sky

502
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,640
is the most dangerous of all military types.

503
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,079
In fact,

504
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,640
I don't want you to like someone like me.

505
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,240
It's late.

506
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,880
I've liked you since I was a kid.

507
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,960
Always.

508
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,519
I'm not afraid of what you said.

509
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,720
Yuanyin,

510
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,599
Haitang,

511
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:13,440
we are all the same.

512
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,920
As long as we really like someone,

513
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,000
we won't be afraid.

514
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,599
But,

515
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,880
Nianqiao,

516
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,400
do you like me?

517
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,519
I like you.

518
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,759
Is that the way brother likes sister?

519
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,640
Or is it that the way Zhang Qi likes Haitang?

520
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,680
Qianying,

521
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:36,599
in fact, I…

522
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
[Fuhua University]

523
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,960
Are you Zeng Nianqiao?

524
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,359
Yes.

525
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,880
Come with us.

526
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,200
Captain Zhang,

527
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,039
this is our third encounter.

528
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:15,119
I feel the thrill of meeting a rival.

529
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,400
This time,

530
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,640
I am sure enough to make you sacrifice.

531
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,400
But whether to kill you or not

532
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,160
is up to me.

533
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,039
You and I are both sensible people.

534
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Let me just say it directly.

535
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,000
Oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

536
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:36,319
have nothing to do with elite pilots like you.

537
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,759
Why don't you help me find it?

538
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,079
Then I can report to my superiors.

539
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,119
As for all your previous crimes,

540
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,640
I can help you deal with them.

541
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,559
I promise,

542
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,759
not only will you and your men get freedom,

543
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,680
but I'll also give you a commendation

544
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,200
and restore your reputation.

545
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:56,920
How about it?

546
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,599
Jin Zhilie didn't entrust Zeng Nianqiao,

547
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,880
but you.

548
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,279
I know

549
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,960
you have oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

550
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,599
You want to protect it

551
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,359
and those who are related to it.

552
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,640
But if you're not smart enough,

553
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,200
not only will Zeng Nianqiao and Meng Haichen

554
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,759
die with you,

555
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:31,759
but I won't spare anyone

556
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,400
related to oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

557
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,599
including the Meng family.

558
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,599
If you lay a finger on them,

559
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,519
I promise you'll die worse than

560
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,000
those Japanese planes I shot down.

561
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,920
Calm down.

562
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,200
Calm down.

563
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:54,960
Stand up.

564
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:03,680
Sit down.

565
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,400
On November 17th,

566
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,800
the case of Zhang Qi and two others

567
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,400
who disobeyed military orders

568
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:21,519
will now be tried at the Air Force Officers' School.

569
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,320
I preside over the trial

570
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,719
on behalf of National Government Aviation Council.

571
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,800
This case took place in Kunming,

572
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,760
and Supervisor Bai Fei

573
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,990
was appointed to be in charge of
local affairs in Kunming.

574
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,000
So he will supervise the trial of this case.

575
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,280
And Lu Ziyi,

576
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,360
Deputy Chief of Military Law Section of the Council

577
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,679
and Chief of the Political Training Division

578
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,679
of the Air Force Officers' School,

579
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,800
as one of the trial judges,

580
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,320
will ask the accused questions on behalf of the court.

581
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,800
Supervisor Bai…

582
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,280
Director Lu,

583
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,559
please.

584
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,199
Tang Shizhen didn't come?

585
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,599
My father called all night last night.

586
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,960
He said we should go directly

587
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,840
to Director Huang today.

588
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,430
But he said he wasn't sure.

589
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,360
Let's see when we get there.

590
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,239
Take off in five minutes.

591
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,719
Stand by in Chongqing.

592
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:26,679
Yes, sir.

593
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,280
Tell Shanhuba Airport

594
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,100
to prepare a car for me.

595
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,990
I'll leave as soon as I land.

596
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:33,800
Yes.

597
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,119
Defendant Zhang Qi,

598
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,960
in the last six months,

599
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,519
what is the air defense policy of Kunming?

600
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,239
War avoidance.

601
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,159
No take off.

602
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,100
Strengthen defense only with multiple alarms

603
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,159
and ground air defense forces.

604
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,940
Avoid unnecessary sacrifice.

605
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:09,119
Have you expressed your dissatisfaction

606
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,519
publicly many times?

607
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,320
In the past half a year,

608
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,760
the Japanese army repeatedly
violated the airspace of Yunnan.

609
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,280
Our army retreated because of fear,

610
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,199
and adopted the policy of avoiding war,

611
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,360
resulting in damage to the country

612
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,039
and suffering of the people.

613
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,050
The Yunnan-Myanmar and Yunnan-Vietnam lines
were repeatedly paralyzed.

614
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,990
The most important transportation hub

615
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,920
on the Yunnan-Myanmar line, Huitong Bridge,

616
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,760
was bombed indiscriminately

617
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,840
by hundreds of enemy planes.

618
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,250
The air raid on January 12th in Kunming

619
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,760
caused heavy losses

620
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,760
and numerous deaths and injuries.

621
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,000
All of the above

622
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,039
were the results of missing opportunities

623
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,800
due to war avoidance.

624
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,199
I have repeatedly

625
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,000
submit my opinion through normal channels.

626
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,599
This policy was issued by Central Aviation Council

627
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,119
to preserve the strength of our army,

628
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,990
the purpose of which was to preserve our strength

629
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,280
to fight to the death at the right time.

630
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:16,320
I was ordered to lead Hanguang Squadron

631
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,599
to protect the airspace over Kunming.

632
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,119
On November 17th,

633
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,000
after judging that

634
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,780
the enemy will launch indiscriminate bombings

635
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,400
on our military bases in Kunming,

636
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,519
battle supplies, military and civilian lives

637
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,000
were all within the bombing range.

638
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:30,719
At this critical moment,

639
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,280
if I don't give the order to fight

640
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,620
and delay the opportunity to fight,

641
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,199
then the southwest front will be lost.

642
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,599
Then how can we talk about

643
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,970
the future of our air defense?

644
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:52,840
I'm willing to take all the responsibility for this.

645
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,519
Presiding Judge,

646
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,320
from the defendant's words,

647
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
it is clear that he defied

648
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,239
the policy of Aviation Council.

649
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,410
He ignored his superiors, and did whatever he wanted.

650
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,079
On November 17th,

651
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,840
he led his troops into the air,

652
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,719
deliberately disobeying military orders.

653
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:17,800
On that day,

654
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,239
the first commander on the scene

655
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,900
was Tang Shizhen,

656
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,500
the minister the Air Force Officers' School.

657
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,480
He gave an accurate order,

658
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,400
ordering 075 to return immediately,

659
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,280
and denying defendant Zhang Qi's request

660
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,440
to take off to fight.

661
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:32,920
However,

662
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,000
Zhang Qi led

663
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,519
Zeng Nianqiao and Meng Haichen,

664
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,119
the three of them to take off the planes,

665
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,760
which is a clear violation of military orders.

666
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,079
And Zhang Qi was mainly responsible.

667
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:43,880
Presiding Judge,

668
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,159
Director Lu,

669
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,920
I see that the minster of the Aviation School,

670
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,480
Mr. Tang, is also the main witness.

671
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,800
It's a pity he's not here today.

672
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,840
Without his testimony,

673
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,719
it's too early to draw a conclusion.

674
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,760
Supervisor Bai,

675
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,710
three ground staff of the tower

676
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,480
on that day can testify separately.

677
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,039
Director Lu, you don't know that

678
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,400
the first commander of Wujiaba military airport

679
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,199
is Minster Tang.

680
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,599
I don't remember an order

681
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:21,559
not to allow warplanes to take off

682
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,000
to defend Kunming.

683
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,119
Supervisor Bai,

684
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:30,719
could it be that you…

685
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,159
I wouldn't be wrong about such a big deal.

686
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,480
Director Lu,

687
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,400
hold off on drawing conclusions,

688
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,559
and continue to report the evidence.

689
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:43,840
Okay.

690
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,159
Please Meng Haichen,

691
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,639
a member of Hanguang Squadron to testify.

692
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,760
How is Haichen a witness?

693
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,599
Meng Haichen,

694
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,519
do you know the crime of disobeying military orders?

695
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,719
Capital offense.

696
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,280
I'll give you a chance now.

697
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,000
Identify Zhang Qi on the spot,

698
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,639
then I'll turn you into a witness.

699
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,280
I won't testify against my captain.

700
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,239
Okay.

701
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,559
Then look at what you did.

702
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,079
Meng Haichen,

703
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,440
on whose orders did you take off that day?

704
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,800
I was ordered by my captain

705
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,440
to act as a patrol fighter

706
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,400
to lure the enemy into the floating bomb area.

707
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,519
Floating bomb.

708
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:12,280
Is there any precedent for the floating bombs
in previous air battles?

709
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:13,719
No.

710
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,719
No.

711
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,920
Then I'm interested.

712
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,519
Whose idea was this?

713
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,119
Captain.

714
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,639
Zhang Qi.

715
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:30,079
When Zhang Qi proposed the floating bombs,

716
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,199
did the team have any objections?

717
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:35,550
The original words were that

718
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,000
the floating bombs were used

719
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,119
only twice over Chongqing,

720
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,639
and then they were banned by Aviation Council.

721
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,079
I said that.

722
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,880
But the floating bombs

723
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,239
did have a decisive effect in combat.

724
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:46,679
Sit down.

725
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,719
Be quiet.

726
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:48,880
Yes,

727
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,000
that's what Commander Chen said.

728
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,559
But our floating bombs

729
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,039
have been safely modified

730
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,000
to avoid the original...

731
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,119
As the witness said,

732
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,559
on November 17th,

733
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:04,519
Zhang Qi firstly violated Aviation Council's order

734
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,639
forbidding the use of floating bombs,

735
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,560
and then he disobeyed

736
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,719
the war avoidance order of Wujiaba Airport.

737
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:13,320
Lieutenant Meng,

738
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,119
let me ask you more.

739
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,679
Why did you take off again

740
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,670
when you were supposed to return immediately

741
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:21,880
after completing the mission

742
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,679
according to Minister Tang's orders?

743
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,639
Who gave you that order?

744
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,900
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

745
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:51,800
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:59,250
