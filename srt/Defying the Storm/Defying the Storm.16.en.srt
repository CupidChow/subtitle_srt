[Episode 16]

4
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,480
Haitang,

5
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,120
I have something for you.

6
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,400
You are quick at making sandals.

7
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,480
Donglai,

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,920
this pair of scandals

9
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,959
counts as the tip for storytelling.

10
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,040
OK?

11
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,480
OK.

12
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,520
When did you finish it?

13
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,199
Haitang,

14
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,599
that's for you.

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,919
Leg wrappings are necessary for a long walk.

17
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,000
Before going out,

18
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,479
wrap it tightly.

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,840
After one day's journey,

20
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,840
take it down and soak your feet in warm water.

21
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,639
Otherwise blood will stop flowing

22
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,639
and your calves will hurt.

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,639
Since our destination is Kunming,

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,680
I have an idea.

25
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,560
Just now I found that
Haitang and Yuanyin are very familiar

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,039
with the ancient prose.

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,599
Could you two teach

28
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,639
my students on our way to Kunming?

29
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,919
Of course.

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,599
We used to teach in Haiyu School.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,680
We can teach them.

32
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,960
Great.

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,159
Then you're teachers of
Shouchang Middle School.

34
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,719
But there's a problem.

35
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,479
I can't afford to pay you.

36
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,240
But we have grain.

37
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,439
We'll cut down on one bite a day

38
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,639
and share with you.

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,400
The weather is cold and the world is chaotic.

40
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,759
We can eat hot food and

41
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,719
look after each other.

42
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,319
Is it OK?

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,080
Sure.

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,840
OK.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,639
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

46
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,039
I know that Mr. Fu is caring for us.

47
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,680
Then what subject should I teach?

48
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,719
I don't want to be starved.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
You could make more scandals.

50
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,479
Donglai,

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,759
you're one member of Shouchang Middle School.

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,879
You're smart.

53
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,240
Would you please take care of

54
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,759
everyone on the way?

55
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,920
Uncle Ling, be careful.

56
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,319
Doesn't matter.

57
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,160
You must be tired.

58
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Let's have a rest.

59
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,920
OK. Let's take a break.

60
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,519
Mr. Ling,

61
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,120
are you OK?

62
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,519
Why is my neck so stiff?

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,959
Uncle Ling, let me help you.

64
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,920
OK, OK.

65
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,319
Uncle Ling, how do you feel?

66
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,120
Better.

67
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,959
You have breakfast this morning?

68
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:50,959
This morning...

69
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,879
You... you did...

70
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,360
How do you feel?

71
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,959
You...

72
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,319
Feeling better?

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,079
Where did you learn it?

74
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,800
Military school.

75
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Good job, Haichen.

76
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,040
You do know a lot.

77
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,439
Not bad.

78
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,040
Haichen, here.

79
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,040
Put luggage here.

80
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,160
Uncle Ling,

81
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,079
have a rest.

82
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,639
OK.

83
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,000
Uncle Ling,

84
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,480
we only took one ride along the way.

85
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,639
We kept walking the rest of the time.

86
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,480
Right.

87
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
You must be tired.

88
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,000
Today we should have a good rest.

89
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,399
OK.

90
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,920
Haichen,

91
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,040
take care of Uncle Ling.

92
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,680
You'd better let him have a good sleep.

93
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,319
I'll go into the town

94
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,240
to get some food.

95
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,759
OK.

96
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,800
Uncle Ling, have a good rest.

97
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,439
Thank you so much.

98
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,079
You're welcome.

99
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,839
Haichen,

100
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,959
I want some water.

101
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,439
Let me see.

102
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,839
Here.

103
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,560
Great.

104
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,639
Where are my rubbings?

105
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,040
Hong'en and I bring them for you.

106
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,199
Let me have a look.

107
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,759
We have to preserve these things well.

108
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,039
Uncle Ling,

109
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,320
you just had a long journey.

110
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,279
Sleep for a while.

111
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,039
OK.

112
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,879
You, too.

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,159
OK.

114
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,120
What are you doing?

115
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,399
What do you want?

116
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,120
Boss,

117
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,960
I want to know

118
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,559
if there's a stable.

119
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,159
Or a woodshed.

120
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,639
I don't have money to

121
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,720
stay in a hotel.

122
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,159
Please let me stay for a night.
Just one night.

123
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,559
I'll take care of my luggage.

124
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,559
You're a beggar.

125
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm not a beggar.

126
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,879
Go away. Go away.

127
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,720
Boss,

128
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,039
I'm not a beggar.

129
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,159
Go away. Go away.

130
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,960
I'm not a beggar.

131
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,799
Go away. Quickly.

132
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,879
I... I'm not a beggar.

133
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,679
Professor Zeng.

134
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,519
Uncle Zeng.

135
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,559
Professor Zeng.

136
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
Ling Wenyue.

137
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
I'm coming. I'm coming.

138
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,440
Professor Zeng.

139
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,639
Professor Zeng.

140
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,759
Uncle Zeng.

141
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,080
We meet again.

142
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,919
Why are you here?

143
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,799
I live in here.

144
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,440
Really!

145
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:55,559
You...

146
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,200
I'll take it for you.

147
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,840
Doesn't matter.

148
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,039
How did you become like this?

149
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,519
I'm out of money.

150
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,279
What's that?

151
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,639
Precious thing.

152
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,480
Uncle Ling,

153
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,159
Guess who I met?

154
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,240
Chen Dairong.

155
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,759
Mr. Ling. Mr. Zeng.

156
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,919
Mr. Zeng.

157
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,200
What a coincidence!

158
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,720
Mr. Zeng.

159
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,679
I didn't expect to see you in Xiangtan.

160
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,600
Yeah.

161
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,360
How about that!

162
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,039
Come in here.

163
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,360
Warm yourself and tidy up.

164
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,639
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

165
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,799
Great!

166
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,399
Just now the Boss didn't let me in.

167
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
Let's go.

168
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,720
It smells delicious.

169
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:41,879
Mr. Zeng,

170
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,759
Why are you always guarding

171
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
a pickle jar?

172
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,360
That's yours.

173
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,919
OK.

174
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,080
This one has vinegar.

175
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
Do you know why even cats and dogs
are annoyed with someone?

176
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,559
That's because they're too nosy.

177
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,679
You annoying old man.

178
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
You didn't get a room today.

179
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,200
Why don't you spend the night

180
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
with a nosy dog like me?

181
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,279
Since we sleep together,

182
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,080
I'd like to figure out whether you're a cat or a dog.

183
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,159
It's hard on me.

184
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,279
Dairong,

185
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,200
Since you started from Changsha,

186
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,559
you should take the train.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,480
Why did you walk here?

188
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,600
Maybe you got lost, too?

189
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,600
Yes.

190
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,480
But I didn't get separated from

191
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,679
those who take the train.

192
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,360
Most people in our school

193
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,759
took the train and

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,480
followed the routine you mentioned.

195
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,200
More than 60 male teachers and male students

196
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,759
set up a teacher-student walking group.

197
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,080
Since we help each other,

198
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,080
we can walk to Kunming.

199
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,840
We have no other options.

200
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,240
Enjoy life though hard up.

201
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,700
Not only read thousands of books,

202
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,720
but also travel thousands of miles.

203
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,360
That's true.

204
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,600
But just four days after we set out,

205
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,559
we separated.

206
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,960
I brought five students with me.

207
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,960
What a long road!

208
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,519
It's more than 1,600 kilometers.

209
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,440
In my opinion,

210
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,960
we have at least another three months to go.

211
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
He deserves it.

212
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,159
Where are my books?

213
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,799
I forget to tell you.

214
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,879
I asked the school transporter
to deliver your books.

215
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,440
Now those books should arrive in Kunming.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Good.

217
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,519
Good.

218
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,879
I have been sitting in my study for years

219
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,279
without moving a muscle.

220
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,480
This time I have the opportunity

221
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,799
to go around and have a look at

222
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,360
our motherland in danger.

223
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
With those books and rubbings,

224
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,360
I can write while walking.

225
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
What a nice thing.

226
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,399
Although our country is in danger,

227
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,480
Mr. Ling could take the responsibility.

228
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,480
How capable you are.

229
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,759
You see. You see. You see.

230
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,840
Professor Zeng, how about you?

231
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,480
Me?

232
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,360
You can't catch up with me while walking.

233
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,159
That's true.

234
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,200
Then we can go together.

235
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,039
Deal.

236
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,279
In early August,

237
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,799
at the night before leaving Peiping,

238
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,840
I went to visit Fuhua alone.

239
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,759
The moon was bright and there's no one around.

240
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,919
I shouted to the moon that

241
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,440
we would be back, right?

242
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,480
There's no answer.

243
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,480
There's nothing but shame and endless

244
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,600
disillusionment in my heart.

245
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,279
After arriving in Changsha,

246
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,480
just when things were getting better,
we had to evacuate.

247
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,320
Our ancestors expanded

248
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,480
national boundaries, gave people a place to live

249
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,240
and made our country prosperous.

250
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,200
But now we end up with

251
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,679
the loss of the northeast and

252
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,639
the north of China.

253
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,600
Our journey to Kunming

254
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,039
could be counted as

255
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,960
3,000 miles on foot and 10,000 miles in exile.

256
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,240
But...

257
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,679
But when could this end?

258
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,000
Is Kunming necessarily a safe place?

259
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,120
Can we return to our beloved Peiping city one day

260
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,039
to see the moon hanging over
the Lugou Bridge again?

261
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,519
In history, there have been three times

262
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,039
when those who went to the South
failed to return to the north.

263
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,759
Those are people in Jin Dynasty,

264
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,399
people in Song Dynasty

265
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,200
and people in Ming Dynasty,

266
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,279
That's the blood and tears

267
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,320
and unspeakable pain of our nation.

268
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,799
Now I don't know when we can return to

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,039
the south of the Yangtze River and

270
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,799
recover the north of Hebei.

271
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,720
But all those places we passed by

272
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,559
belong to our country.

273
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,000
Good point.

274
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,600
Good point.

275
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,039
Give me another bowl of noodles.

276
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,759
I should be glad to meet you.

277
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,559
Why mentioning this heavy topic again?

278
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,519
Tell you the truth.

279
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,679
Along the way

280
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,279
I have collected a lot of folk songs,

281
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,480
even wild vegetable songs.

282
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,240
For example, Mother's Garden Chrysanthemum.

283
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,240
Sing to us.

284
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,799
And some ancient rhymes.

285
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,360
Listen.

286
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,840
I'll share with you.

287
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,759
I'll share with you.

288
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,279
Listen.

289
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Mother's Garden Chrysanthemum,

290
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,919
it is firmly rooted.

291
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,360
The root can't be separated.

292
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,000
It's closely bound together.

293
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,840
While selling the son on the passenger ship,

294
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,399
the son hugged his mother and refused to let go.

295
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,039
Good.

296
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,960
Moon, moon.

297
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,080
Today

298
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,559
I should call you crescent moon.

299
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,559
Have you ever seen

300
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,320
the swallows by my old house?

301
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,639
Have you ever seen them

302
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,679
mend their old nests with weeds?

303
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,360
Remember to tell them

304
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,120
to move the new nest under the porch.

305
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,559
Don't let them get caught in the rain.

306
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,840
Why do you stay up late at night?

307
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,279
If you want to talk to the moon,

308
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,039
please go outside.

309
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,279
Fine. Fine. Fine.

310
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,519
Close the window.

311
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,600
It's so cold.

312
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,879
OK. OK. OK.

313
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,600
That's the place.

314
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,760
[Anyi Primary School]

315
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,319
Sir, I can help you.

316
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,079
OK.

317
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,240
Thank you.

318
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,759
I have been here before.

319
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,359
Why is it like this now?

320
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,960
It seems that this place used to be a hospital.

321
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,799
Who cares?

322
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,119
It's nice to have a place to sleep

323
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,960
without paying the money.

324
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,240
Mr. Fu,

325
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,079
we'll rest in that room later.

326
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,319
This room is for the girls.

327
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,359
OK.

328
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,559
We'll make do with one night
and start tomorrow.

329
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:09,880
Let's go.

330
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:11,920
Bu,

331
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,200
come here.

332
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,559
Let's go.

333
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,279
Huang Shixing, follow us.

334
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,160
Haitang,

335
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,079
Don't you need watering this sapling?

336
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,279
No.

337
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,319
Since it's cold, it'll die if being watered.

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,039
It's not easy for you

339
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
to take it and treasure it along our journey.

340
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,799
Everyone has his treasure.

341
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,960
To tell you the truth,

342
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,519
the wishes I've made to it

343
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,720
have been fulfilled every time.

344
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,440
It's very useful.

345
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,720
Really?

346
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,480
Haitang,

347
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,880
can we succeed in walking to Kunming?

348
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,519
It's been a month.

349
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,319
We just arrived in Nanchang.

350
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,839
I'm sure we can.

351
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,759
They're waiting for us in Kunming.

352
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,759
But will everything be all right in Kunming?

353
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,000
If the Japanese can bomb Hangzhou,

354
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,119
maybe they can also bomb Kunming.

355
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,200
If...

356
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,759
We've seen so many people

357
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,240
fleeing and dead on this journey.

358
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Even this place has the trace of blood.

359
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,039
Yuanyin, don't get your head around it.

360
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,640
Poshan and Zhang Qi

361
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,799
are waiting for us in Kunming.

362
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,519
We could see them

363
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,880
as long as we live and have hope in our mind.

364
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,119
And then we'll never be apart again.

365
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,240
While in Kunming,

366
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,920
I'd like to continue to study.

367
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,200
Maybe you can stop going to normal school.

368
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,400
Let's major in history together.

369
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,440
Professor Ling's classes are very interesting.

370
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,519
I have no idea.

371
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,319
Haitang, you see.

372
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,799
Does it look like the logo of Poshan's squadron?

373
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,440
That's the logo of Hanguang Squadron.

374
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,440
What's that?

375
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,880
It seems that they have been here.

376
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,799
He's not supposed to leave

377
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,599
his graduation bracelet.

378
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,000
[Zhang Qi, Hanguang Squadron]

379
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,440
Impossible.

380
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,160
That's impossible.

381
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,079
He must have just been injured here.

382
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,240
I had a dream about him the other day.

383
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,000
Impossible.

384
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,839
Don't worry.

385
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,440
He'll be fine.

386
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,440
♫ Look up at the falling sunset clouds ♫

387
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,440
♫ Listen to the stars whispering ♫

388

Cardiac arrest.

393

One milligram of adrenaline.

394
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:34,880
Be quick.

395
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,400
♫ Years are like a black and white painting ♫

397

Zhang Qi,

398
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,240
this letter is for you.

399
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,279
It's also for Huansheng,

400
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,759
Kejing, Hanxun,

401
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,480
and every member of Hanguang Squadron.

402

♫ Our home under the Banyan tree ♫

406
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,599
Captain, I can't bail out.

407
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,960
Again, I can't bail out.

408
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,119
It's stuck.

409
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,480
The problem still exists.

410
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,279
Add another milligram of adrenaline.

411
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,039
Intravenous bolus.

412
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:34,599
Be quick.

413
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,920
I don't know if you're still alive.

414
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,720
The battle you're going to fight

415
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,460
is a dangerous one sacrificing for our country

416
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,680
and a journey with no return.

417
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,759
Fight to win or die.

418
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,759
- Fight to win or die.
- Fight to win or die.

419
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,240
Hanguang Squadron.

420
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,400
Yes. Yes.

421
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,839
That's the final war.

422
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,119
A mission with no return.

423
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,359
A mission with no return.

424
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,119
I saw blood stains

425
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:07,079
on an operating table in Nanchang.

426
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,519
For some reason,

427
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,440
it was like I saw everyone's life

428
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,000
slipping away at that moment.

429
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,799
There's no captured air force.

430
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,240
Perish with them.

431
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,839
All of you are still young.

432
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,039
You are supposed to be with parents and enjoy

433
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,720
the bright future ahead of you.

434
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,519
But you gave away everything

435
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,599
you had in your youth.

436
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,640
And you have given your opportunities,

437
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,359
your potential love,

438
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,480
your family, your children,

439
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,400
and all the rights and joys of life

440
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,000
to this suffering country.

441
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,240
If you really sacrifice,

442
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,359
you die in the right path.

443
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,559
Maybe I should be happy for you.

444
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,759
But I can't bear to part with you.

445
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,839
Your faces and voices

446
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:31,200
often bring back memories.

447
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,119
I can only comfort myself in this way.

448
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,680
The dead soldiers may not have

449
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,599
been able to visit the three islands themselves.

450
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,359
But the comrades who survived

451
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,359
will surely take the responsibility.

452
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,759
The day will come when lands ravaged
by the enemy will be recovered.

453
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,559
Yes.

454
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,160
I believe you're still alive.

455
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,400
All of you are still alive.

456
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,319
What has dissipated

457
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,400
in the world is but a husk.

458
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,720
But the spirit of the devotees is immortal.

459
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,279
Though we may be far away,

460
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,359
death does not remove

461
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,680
the bonds between our hearts.

462
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,880
Maybe you have already departed from this world.

463
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,200
But in my mind,

464
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,680
you're still alive.

465
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,839
And you will wave your scarves at me again

466
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,599
and shouted that

467
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,799
Meng Haitang, we all like you.

468
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,079
Meng Haitang, we all like you.

469
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:42,400
Yes.

470
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,839
China needs to move forward.

471
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,960
Darkness is waiting for dawn.

472
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,240
Anyway,

473
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,279
I will continue to wait for you.

474
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,240
My bet with you is not over yet.

475
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,799
Doctor, how's it going?

476
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,720
He's out of danger.

477
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,039
Thank you. Thank you.

478
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,759
Great. Great.

479
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,200
Thank you. Thank you.

480
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,000
Thank you.

481
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,039
Hong'en, I got two tickets

482
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,400
from Hengyang to Kunming.

483
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,920
Those tickets are not easy to get.

484
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:25,799
Who are going to leave?

485
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
Uncle Ling must leave.

486
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,559
As for the other one,

487
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,920
I think I should go with him.

488
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,559
How about Mr. Zeng and Mr. Chen?

489
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,319
Mr. Chen is going to lead the school walking group.

490
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,960
Mr. Zeng is an odd man.

491
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,680
I think it's difficult to persuade him.

492
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,920
Besides,

493
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,759
I promised my uncle

494
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,680
that I would send Uncle Ling safely to him.

495
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,519
OK, I know.

496
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,119
Hong'en, the newspaper office
was bombed yesterday afternoon.

497
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,400
Chief Editor Chen was killed.

498
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,240
He refused to leave until his death.

499
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,279
He said the fall of any nation's capital

500
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,799
was a story worth chronicled.

501
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,799
He kept his promise as a journalist

502
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,119
until his last breath.

503
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,000
You're also a journalist.

504
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,519
I did not forget my mission.

505
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,480
I will set up a new newspaper office in Kunming.

506
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,279
Uncle Ling,

507
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,599
we can't miss this train again.

508
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,400
It's not easy to get these two tickets.

509
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,200
We could give this ticket to Haichen

510
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,160
or other people.

511
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,279
I don't want to take the train.

512
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,200
I just want to go with the crowd.

513
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,599
How could that be possible?

514
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,319
An inexperienced young man as Haichen,

515
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,599
he should go around to see the world.

516
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,000
Actually I shouldn't leave.

517
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,279
But I'm in a hurry to set up
a newspaper office in Kunming.

518
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,319
I...

519
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,119
I want to use my pen as my weapon

520
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,119
to go into battle.

521
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,839
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

522
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:10,960
I heard you had a headache.

523
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,799
That's my old problem.

524
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,200
But it doesn't hinder me from walking.

525
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,880
Fine.

526
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,640
The weather is cold.
Take care of yourself.

527
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,839
Qianying is waiting for you.

528
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,559
OK. Let's go.

529
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,550
[Hengyang Railway Station]

530
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,359
Mr. Ling, please wait for a while.

531
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,240
I'll get the tickets.

532
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,200
OK. OK.

533
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,200
What?

534
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,519
Editor Xiao, please go with us.

535
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,200
What...

536
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,480
What's going on?

537
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:32,880
What do you want?

538
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,880
Why taking my tickets?

539
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,440
Editor Xiao,

540
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,279
want your tickets?

541
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,799
We are on the same train.

542
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,359
No.5 carriage.

543
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,200
We could go together.

544
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,599
But...

545
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,359
who are you?

546
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,240
What do you want?

547
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:02,400
It is not a question of who I am now,

548
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,319
but of whether you can leave Hengyang alive.

549
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,599
Don't be scared.

550
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,400
We met before.

551
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,359
Really?

552
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:16,640
Brother.

553
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,960
You are...

554
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,039
The warfare training inspector

555
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,519
in Central Aviation Council.

556
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,400
According to the wartime regulations,

557
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,000
we're looking for the things that

558
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,920
threaten national security.

559
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,119
We now suspect that the item

560
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,160
is in the possession of Professor Ling Wenyue

561
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
of Fuhua University.

562
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,039
We also suspect that

563
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,680
his book Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar

564
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,720
may have a great impact

565
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,960
on international relations.

566
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,759
Under the order of Central Aviation Council,

567
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,160
we ask you to cooperate with us

568
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,559
to monitor Professor Ling.

569
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:04,799
What?

570
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,000
That's impossible.

571
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,160
Mr. Ling is an honest man.

572
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,599
A journalist as I am,

573
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,079
how could I do that?

574
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,359
Mr. Ling is an honest man.

575
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,920
But how about you?

576
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,599
What you did when you studied in Japan

577
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,359
is under our control.

578
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,119
You must remember it.

579
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,240
As long as you cooperate with us

580
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
to get access to

581
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,519
what Ling Wenyue has,

582
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,440
I can promise that we can destroy

583
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,450
all the evidence of what you did in Japan.

584
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,559
I...

585
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,799
I was too young at that time.

586
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:49,759
Besides,

587
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,160
I've never done anything

588
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,440
to betray my country.

589
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm not gonna do anything for you.

590
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,599
And I want to take a look

591
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,559
at your I.D. again.

592
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,599
You joined the Panlong Society of Japan.

593
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,119
You and Japanese right-wing scholars

594
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,200
advocated the denial of Chinese ancient history.

595
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,119
You know what I mean.

596
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,519
Bring Ling Wenyue to No.5 carriage.

597
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,880
Mr. Ling, I get the tickets.

598
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,839
Let's go.

599
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:52,599
OK.

600
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,319
Right.

601
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,440
After boarding on the train,

602
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,400
could you tell me

603
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,240
more about your book

604
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,519
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar?

605
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:01,160
OK.

606
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:04,759
You dare to break in here.

607
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,720
Come here. Come here.

608
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,240
Let me go.

609
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,720
Come here.

610
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,359
Don't touch me.

611
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,119
Come here.

612
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,280
You broke in.

613
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,119
Want to make trouble?

614
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:11,719
Sorry, please stop.

615
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,480
Don't hit me.

616
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,199
Please let him go.

617
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,559
He's the child of my neighbor
who has separated from his parents.

618
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,719
We're going to Kunming.

619
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,559
I'll give you the money

620
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,159
for ticket extension.

621
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,639
What ticket extension?

622
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,320
There's no ticket.

623
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:25,439
Don't you see these people?

624
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,119
There's no ticket.

625
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,480
The seats are not enough.

626
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,199
No entry without a ticket.

627
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,800
Father, let's get in.

628
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,159
Mr. Ling, the train has arrived.

629
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,760
Let's go.

630
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,360
Ticket.

631
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,920
I'm 70 years old.

632
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,840
I've lived enough.

633
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,800
One more day is a gift from god.

634
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,119
Boy, stand up.

635
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,079
You have to go.

636
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,519
Grandpa, I can't take it.

637
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,400
Take it.

638
00:34:55,518 --> 00:34:56,359
You have to go.

639
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,679
Get aboard the train.

640
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,400
Your way ahead is still long.

641
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,559
Grandpa, I...

642
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,400
Father.

643
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,320
Father.

644
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,199
I won't go without you.

645
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,079
Hello.

646
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,000
There's one ticket.

647
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,079
You take it.

648
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,440
Get abroad the train together.

649
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,360
What a coincidence.

650
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm in a hurry.

651
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,599
So I can't leave now.

652
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,320
May you be safe throughout the journey.

653
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,639
Mr. Ling, how could that be possible?

654
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,119
Mr. Ling, how can you get to Kunming

655
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,320
in your condition?

656
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,440
Just now you mentioned
Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

657
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,239
Do you know that

658
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,400
since Tang established the capital

659
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,440
until Pangeng established the capital in Yin,

660
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,760
it took many generations of hard work

661
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,559
to find such a safe place.

662
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,559
I'm just a bookworm.

663
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:50,000
Sitting in the study for so many years,

664
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:52,119
I'm useless to the country or the people.

665
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,159
I just thought that

666
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,239
I should walk on the land of China on foot

667
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,079
and meet the villagers living on this land.

668
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,480
Otherwise,

669
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,679
I can't finish Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

670
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,559
Give me that.

671
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:10,880
Take the train.

672
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,239
Mr. Ling.

673
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,159
Excuse me.

674
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:33,840
Excuse me.

675
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,199
Where's Ling Wenyue?

676
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,239
He gave his ticket to others.

677
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,480
He decided to stay.

678
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,079
What?

679
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,519

698
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,119
Nanjing is occupied.

699
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,719
Japanese troop occupied Nanjing.

700
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,119
They did all kinds of bad things.

701
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,000
They didn't even let go of children.

702
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,039
The government misjudged the war.

703
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,559
The military retreat was chaotic.

704
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,840
The defense was poor.

705
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:53,639
And people can't retreat in time.

706
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,960
They said they wanted to protect the people

707
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,320
but they didn't have a practical plan.

708
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,039
Bullshit.

709
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,840
The Japanese are slaughtering in the city.

710
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,599
There are 600,000 Chinese in Nanjing.

711
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,239
600,000!

712
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,920
But...

713
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,800
we can do nothing.

714
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,719
Scholars are the most useless.

715
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,920
The weapons are gone. It's getting dark.

716
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,880
The general is dead. The soldiers mourn.

717
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,119
With my bare hands, I shouted that

718
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,360
who could save the country!

719
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,599
Who could save the country!

720
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,440
I was filled with anger
at the failure of my ambition.

721
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,519
A dangerous atmosphere envelope all around.

722
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,400
Tigers, leopards and ghosts are afraid.

723
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,599
What could we do to with those ghosts?

724
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,519
They were abandoned
in the mountains after deaths.

725
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,360
Blood and bones are everywhere.

726
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,119
I can't go back since my home is far away.

727
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,719
The war will not stop.

728
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,000
The sacrifice of our soldiers has not paid off.

729
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,599
Soldiers have tried their best.

730
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,119
But the war continues.

731
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,000
So cold.

732
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,840
Give me the pillow.

733
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,159
Thank you.

734
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,199
Miss Meng,

735
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:28,880
Miss Xu.

736
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,960
Mr. Fu.

737
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,960
Please take care of those kids.

738
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,079
I'll pick up some firewood to make a fire.

739
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,039
Be careful.

740
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,679
OK. Thank you.

741
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:53,639
Donglai,

742
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
take care of everyone.

743
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,440
Haitang,

744
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,400
I always feel sorry for Mr. Fu.

745
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,559
I heard from those kids that

746
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,480
Mr. Fu has been sorrowful

747
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,760
since his wife passed away.

748
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,239
He has to keep everyone safe along the way.

749
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:21,039
He may become ill from overwork.

750
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,599
He has already been in poor health.

751
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,679
But he insisted in giving the quilt to us.

752
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,679
The weather is so cold.

753
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,320
What if he falls ill?

754
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,079
Right.

755
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,320
We have to find a way to

756
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,480
get him another quilt.

757
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,760
He won't accept the quilt we give back.

758
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,239
The weather is so cold.

759
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,840
He still went to pick up firewood for us.

760
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:43,199
How about that?

761
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,599
Students, come here.

762
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,320
Shall we go and help Mr. Fu collect firewood?

763
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,559
- OK.
- OK.
