[Episode 07]

4
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,710
I've brought the stuff you want.

5
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,960
Mr. Meng is trustworthy. It's good.

6
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,960
I'll put it here,

7
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,400
and you let Mr. Ling go.

8
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,360
You have cars and guns,

9
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
so we can't escape.

10
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,639
Well.

11
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,719
We'll go fifty steps backward.

12
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,280
And you can take it yourself.

13
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,479
I need to check it first.

14
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,120
Is it okay?

15
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,470
The photos of oracle bone inscriptions
of Wuding we published

16
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,120
were all monochrome photos
showing the front side of the oracle bone.

17
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,199
Everyone thinks it is painted by ink.

18
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,839
But real oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

19
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,839
has three red scratches

20
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,199
in the back side.

21
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,279
These are colorful photos.

22
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,720
One is front side.

23
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
The other is back side.

24
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,360
Look, it's red.

25
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,600
Professor Jin Zhilie was dead.

26
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,240
How did you get these two photos?

27
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,120
Only Jin saw the real
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

28
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,360
And no one knows the hidden place.

29
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,950
In order to do research,
Jin Zhilie took these colorful photos before.

30
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,920
His trusted assistant betrayed him,

31
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,560
and handed those photos to my people.

32
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,560
That's why I had them.

33
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,839
If it's fake,

34
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,839
then at least it is made by

35
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,680
the one who saw real
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

36
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,430
or colorful photos before.

37
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,000
Mr. Ling.

38
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,000
All academics know your rule of

39
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,319
behaving and doing research

40
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,360
is always telling the truth.

41
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,800
So Mr. Ling, please make sure

42
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,439
whether this oracle bone is real or not.

43
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,360
Mr. Ling.

44
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,639
Real or fake?

45
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,360
Look carefully, Mr. Ling.

46
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,759
It's me.

47
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,040
Let's go.

48
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,079
If you think that you don't say a word

49
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,439
can guarantee your rule of

50
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
telling the truth in the years of your life,

51
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
that's not possible.

52
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,519
Mr. Meng.

53
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,839
I'm a scholar.

54
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,199
But Mr. Ando is a soldier.

55
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,120
I can't control him.

56
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,079
They can occupy Peiping city,

57
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,480
what else are they afraid of?

58
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,160
You have ten seconds.

59
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,639
If you choose not to say a word,

60
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,759
you and Mr. Meng

61
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,560
can go to hell to meet Professor Jin together.

62

What are you doing?

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,959
If...

71
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,759
something happens,

72
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,070
I'll put oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

73
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,240
in a safe and secret place in advance,

74

Stars are sinking in the west.

81
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,440
Sun is rising.

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,720
Mr. Okayama.

83
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,440
Do you know that?

84
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,720
Well,

85
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,679
culture doesn't only mean words.

86
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,639
It includes a lot of things,

87
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,960
literature, language,

88
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,639
sculpture, architecture,

89
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,320
dancing and painting,

90
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,080
even clothes and costumes.

91
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,399
Oracle bone inscriptions are only characters

92
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,559
engraved on tortoise and bones.

93
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,720
It means a period of history,

94
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,879
also cultural lineage.

95
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,600
Even you get oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding,

96
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,279
can you change this period of history?

97
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,200
Can you reverse the history?

98
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,399
Mr. Okayama.

99
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,120
If you claim to be a real university professor,

100
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,759
I hope your mind and eyesight

101
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,720
shouldn't be so narrow.

102
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
What you pursue should be

103
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,000
the spirit of freedom and the eternal truth.

104
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,000
You shouldn't be a puppet of the invaders,

105
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,360
or an accomplice to politicians.

106
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,960
Mr. Ling.

107
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,200
What I want is only one answer.

108
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,080
Is it real or fake?

109
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,000
Fine.

110
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,240
Then I tell you.

111
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,600
Tell you the truth.

112
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,600
That oracle bone is fake.

113
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,799
Ling Wenyue.

114
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,559
You.

115
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,360
Stop.

116
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,600
Are you blind now?

117
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:03,320
Look at that, real or fake?

118
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,879
Well.

119
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,759
Fine.

120
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,080
Fine.

121
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,480
Ling Wenyue.

122
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,000
We two weren't born on the same day.

123
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,480
Today I, Meng Wuran,

124
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,799
can die with you on the same day.

125
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,840
You can be a patriot.

126
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,639
I'll be here with you.

127
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,080
Patriot.

128
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,679
That sounds so touching.

129
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,670
I don't believe there are real patriots.

130
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,759
Scaring of death,

131
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,759
that's reasonable.

132
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,399
So I believe what you said.

133
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,799
It's real for certain.

134
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,600
But you, Mr. Ling.

135
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,799
You were trying to bring it back.

136
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,840
And you want me to believe your words

137
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,519
just because of your honesty,

138
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,080
in order to buy some time for you.

139
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,799
Mr. Ling.

140
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,519
Are you sure it's real?

141
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,039
No.

142
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,000
When I go back Japan,

143
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,879
I'll do more analysis of its material.

144
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,879
Let's go.

145
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
You...

146
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,270
We are kind of lucky to survive today.

147
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,279
It's you who helped me.

148
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,360
Fine.

149
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,200
I've prepared the car to leave.

150
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's go.

151
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,200
This way.

152
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,480
I...

153
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,240
This way, I...

154
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,360
Where are you going?

155
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,519
Well, the car is there.

156
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,480
Someone is following them.

157
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,840
I'll go to protect them.

158
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,759
If you trust me,

159
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,799
stay here waiting for me.

160
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,679
At ten o'clock.

161
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,360
I'll pick you up here.

162
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
Why didn't you predict that

163
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,200
Okayama wouldn't believe what I said?

164
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,240
I was targeted by guns.

165
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,720
If...if...

166
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,600
I said something wrong,

167
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,879
we would be dead now.

168
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:48,360
Honestly,

169
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,759
I was so nervous just now.

170
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,600
It must be hard for you.

171
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,360
Right.

172
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,480
The car I prepared is in Jingji Alley.

173
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,879
Why do you go up the tower?

174
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,360
We can't go.

175
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,240
Don't you notice that

176
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,120
someone is following us?

177
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,039
Don't look back, go.

178
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,519
You're not silly.

179
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,519
You are silly.

180
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,159
But the car is waiting there.

181
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,320
Why do you come here?

182
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,799
Think about it,

183
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,200
when professor Jin was dying,

184
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,279
he left me several words.

185
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,080
I didn't get it.

186
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,799
Until the moment of the verge of death,

187
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,200
I got it suddenly.

188
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,399
I saw his pigeon

189
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,279
flying around the corner of Zhengyangmen.

190
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,120
The words he left are

191
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,399
Stars in the west.

192
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,600
Morning and Feather.

193
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,279
What do these words mean?

194
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,120
Stars in the west,

195
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,240
means stars are sinking in the west
and the sun is rising.

196
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,320
It means a direction.

197
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,480
Morning, think of it,

198
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
that means sun.

199
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,240
That's Zhengyangmen.

200
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,960
And about feather,

201
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,200
the first meaning can be a pigeon.

202
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,679
It's also possible,

203
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,639
it's saying about

204
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,200
Lord Guan of Zhengyangmen.

205
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,519
Right. That's it.

206
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,759
Let's go.

207
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,639
Look.

208
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,360
The purpose of establishing the statue of Lord Guan

209
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,159
is to bless our country and people.

210
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,840
I think that's also Professor Jin's thought.

211
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,759
Oracle bone.

212
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,240
There is a letter.

213
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,759
Why pieces?

214
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,000
No, it's fake.

215
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,879
Just read the letter.

216
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,360
This...

217
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,120
chess manual.

218
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,360
What's the meaning?

219
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:51,879
Let's go.

220
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Go.

221
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,039
Stop.

222
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
Uncle. Mr. Ling.

223
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,119
Zhang Qi.

224
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,519
Why didn't you leave?

225
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,960
Why are you here?

226
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,559
Didn't you go to Hangzhou?

227
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,480
Right, how about Haichen?

228
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,039
Don't worry, he's fine.

229
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,960
We are running out of time.

230
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,880
I'll help you leave here.

231
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,680
Help Mr. Ling leave first.

232
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,559
I need to find Haitang.

233
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,119
Uncle.

234
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,039
I saw Haitang.

235
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,000
She is safe.

236
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,960
Great.

237
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,920
Zhang Qi, please go to Hangzhou with Haitang.

238
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,759
That's my plan.

239
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,880
The plane prepared for us has two sets.

240
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,559
If you agree,

241
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:11,920
we'll leave.

242
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,200
Of course.

243
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,680
Leave as soon as possible.

244
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,039
Someone is coming.

245
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,799
Come on.

246
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,839
Let's go.

247
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,200
In Central Aviation Council,

248
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,440
Someone has been transporting

249
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,880
smuggled goods on planes.

250
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,599
Those people have been targeting

251
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,480
oracle bone inscriptions.

252
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,599
That day, Professor Jin said

253
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,000
he camp up with a perfect plan.

254
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,880
How about him now?

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,839
He sacrificed.

256
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,319
Comrade Chunjun.

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,599
Comrade Jin Zhilie sacrificed to protect

258
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,799
Peiping Underground Organization from sabotage.

259
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,200
He ended all the clues about
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

260
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,079
in a resolute way.

261
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:16,920
He said

262
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,400
he gave oracle bone inscriptions

263
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,599
of Wuding to an old friend,

264
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,400
who saved him and his left-wing students

265
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,039
many years ago.

266
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,880
He said this man is an activist

267
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,640
who would like to learn new thoughts,

268
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,079
who deserves our trust and recognition.

269
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,799
Jin believes that you can handle the follow-up work.

270
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,480
He left you this book.

271
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
He made marks.

272
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,000
Qiming Star in the east, Changgeng Star in the west.

273
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,440
Changgeng Star,

274
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,400
if it appears, that means war.

275
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,559
This person...

276
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,519
Zhang Qi.

277
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,000
Shuan.

278
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,920
Mr. Meng. Mr. Ling.

279
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,079
You...

280
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,680
Uncle. Mr.Ling.

281
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,960
Please leave now.

282
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,200
I will leave Peiping with Haitang.

283
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,880
Please take care of Haitang.

284
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,200
Be careful.

285
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,039
Don't worry.

286
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,680
Who are you?

287
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,839
It's okay.

288
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,400
It's okay.

289
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,200
Alright.

290
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,640
Delivering vegetables.

291
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,960
Sir.

292
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,359
We met yesterday.

293
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,799
I sent you two zucchinis before.

294
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,000
Stop.

295
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,880
Zhang Qi.

296
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,680
Go.

297
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:51,480
Come on.

298
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,720
Shuan.

299
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,880
Thank you for saving Mr. Ling and me.

300
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,119
I will never forget what you've done for us.

301
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,200
You should go home now.

302
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,759
Stay away from Japanese.

303
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,160
Be careful.

304
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,119
Shuan. Shuan.

305
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,920
You asked me last time to name your son.

306
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,680
I thought about it carefully.

307
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:27,799
Look.

308
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,225
Wu Boxing.
[Wu Boxing]

309
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,450
Wu Boxing.

310
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,200
That's it.

311
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,920
Bo means the eldest son of family.

312
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,839
And Xing represents the hope that

313
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,880
he will bring prosperity to your family.

314
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,920
I hope his whole life will be smooth all the way.

315
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,920
Mr. Ling.

316
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,680
I didn't expect you remember this.

317
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,640
I wouldn't forget it.

318
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,880
What do you think?

319
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,720
It's great.

320
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,359
He is our first child.

321
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,000
I know.

322
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,759
And we will have one more,

323
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,920
two more children.

324
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,200
At that time, please name them.

325
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,960
No problem.

326
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,839
Thank you so much. Thanks.

327
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:04,359
Hurry up.

328
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,680
Take care.

329
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,359
Professor Ling.

330
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,599
I have to go the City Gate.

331
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,160
I have an appointment with Dairong

332
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,000
to get back your drafts.

333
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,039
Stay here. It's safe here.

334
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,559
Please wait me for a moment. Don't leave here.

335
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,079
We have to leave the city

336
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,839
by the car at 10 o'clock.

337
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,799
Stay here.

338
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,400
Don't go anywhere else.

339
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,240
Be careful.

340
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,720
Sure. I know. I will.

341
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,000
Don't leave here.

342
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,839
Take care of yourself.

343
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,160
Go.

344
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,720
That way.

345
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,519
May your soul rest in peace.

346
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,079
May your soul rest in peace.

347
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,799
May your soul rest in peace.

348
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,160
May your soul rest in peace.

349
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,319
Join them.

350
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,839
May your soul rest in peace.

351
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,359
May your soul rest in peace.

352
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,599
May your soul rest in peace.

353
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,000
May your soul rest in peace.

354
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,720
01 told me to take you home.

355
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,160
May your soul rest in peace.

356
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,519
Walk the alley on the right side later.

357
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,319
Let's go.

358
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,400
May your soul rest in peace.

359
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,640
It's so pathetic.

360
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,480
He's selling his vegetables

361
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,799
but got killed suddenly.

362
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,079
It's so brutal.

363
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,759
His family should know this.

364
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,160
Do you know him?

365
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,680
I don't know.

366
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,240
What about you?

367
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,440
Step back. Step back. Don't move.

368
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:29,440
Give way.

369
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:44,880
Wuran.

370
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,920
The passengers on this trunk are

371
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,960
leaving their hometown,

372
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,839
and leaving their families.

373
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,440
They are like us.

374
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,599
I know you are still thinking of Haitang.

375
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,079
It will be fine if we arrive in Hangzhou.

376
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,359
Shuan...

377
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,960
He's shot to death by Japanese.

378
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:18,240
We're so useless though we've learned so much.

379
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,640
The battle against Japanese aggression

380
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,680
in Beiping only last for 21 days.

381
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,960
Beiping-Tianjin area is in great danger.

382
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,440
The North China is at stake.

383
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,880
But now,

384
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,480
Kuomintang government is
waiting for international mediation.

385
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,759
hoping there'll be a peaceful negotiation.

386
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,279
So they're not ready psychologically
for a cruel war.

387
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,180
[Jianqiao Air Force Hospital, Hangzhou]

388
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,240
How is he, Doctor?

389
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,240
He's not injured seriously,
so he'll be healed in a few months.

390
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,559
Because he's got shocked mentally.

391
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,079
Rest at a quiet place.

392
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,039
I've injected him the sedative,

393
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,640
so he'll wake up tomorrow.

394
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,279
Thank you so much.

395
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
How could all of this happen?

396
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,400
Thanks.

397
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,480
Now we're in Hangzhou,

398
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
so it's safe for now.

399
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:33,759
Don't worry.

400
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,039
Well.

401
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,319
My brother is quite

402
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,480
a qualified member of No. 20 Army.

403
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,279
He came to Hangzhou alone,
will he be treated as a deserter?

404
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,720
I've checked it.

405
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,480
Haichen hasn't been on the roll

406
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,880
of Military Academy Corps.

407
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,599
He's not a qualified soldier for now.

408
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,240
That's good.

409
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,119
Did you hear anything about my parents?

410
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,519
I'm wondering if they are okay now.

411
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,680
They are fine.

412
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,039
As soon as they arrive in Hangzhou,

413
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
they'll contact me.

414
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,240
I haven't said thanks to you,

415
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,160
but you've saved me for twice.

416
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,640
Only twice?

417
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,799
I think it's more than what you think.

418
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,559
But that day when I was at your place, you saved me.

419
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,759
We're even.

420
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,759
It's no big deal.

421
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,240
Every Chinese will do the same thing.

422
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,240
Do you know the fake oracle bone?

423
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,039
Someone painted it in red,

424
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:46,880
is it you or the boss?

425
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,720
It's you, right?

426
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,640
I even saw my announcements of freedom.

427
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Well, skip the chat.

428
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,200
I'll take you to the Minister of Education's place.

429
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,839
I've made an agreement with Madam.

430
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,079
At two o'clock in the afternoon,

431
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,359
see you in the woods.

432
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,799
Minister of Education is not at home these days.

433
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
A few days later,

434
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,119
I'll take you somewhere safe.

435
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,359
Thank you.

436
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,799
It's alright.

437
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,160
Drink it.

438
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,039
Give him a fright.

439
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,039
What are you reading?

440
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:45,880
Captain.

441
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,440
Ran asked if you want to play basketball.

442
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,680
How did you know I'm here?

443
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
I know everything about you.

444
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,480
You'll read if anything's on your mind.

445
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,720
It'll be no place but here.

446
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,279
What do you think? Join us?

447
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,200
Nianqiao and you made here finally,

448
00:33:59,319 --> 00:33:59,880
so Ran said

449
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,160
play a game for Hanguang Squadron,

450
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,079
and take some photos.

451
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:03,920
Sounds great.

452
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:04,960
Let's go.

453
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,240
Wait.

454
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,639
I have to wait for Haitang.

455
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,559
She'll come here soon.

456
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,440
A Young Wanderer.

457
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,239
I read it when I was a kid.

458
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,159
Not a bad one.

459
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,760
But there's blood on it.

460
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,360
I picked it up at Yongding River.

461
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,920
A soldier student left it there.

462
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,920
On July 28th,

463
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,360
1100 out of 1700 soldiers died in the battle.

464
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,239
We can't recognize nor know their names.

465
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,920
There's something I can't understand.

466
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,519
We have planes.

467
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,360
Why can't we join the battle?

468
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,559
The soldiers who lived well off withdrew.

469
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,320
Only students soldiers who had never used a gun before

470
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,079
fought till they died.

471
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,320
Fuxing could be retrieved

472
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,960
but was detained in Beiping for a minor excuse.

473
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,199
Then the North China

474
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,639
was taken by the Japanese.

475
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,400
That's right.

476
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,880
Since Sept 18th Incident,

477
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,239
the government has been following the advice
of League of Nations,

478
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,519
hoping there would be international mediation.

479
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,559
After mediation, all we can do is to

480
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,000
sign agreements again and again,

481
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,119
from Songhu Armistice Agreement,
Tanggu Truce Agreement,

482
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,440
to Hemei Agreement.

483
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,360
We retreated from Shanghai,
then the North China.

484
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,000
If the Japanese hadn't been permitted

485
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:38,159
to establish a puppet government
against Communist Party,

486
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,400
the main areas of North China

487
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,920
wouldn't have been the place only for Japanese,

488
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,079
Beiping-Tianjin area wouldn't fall into their hands.

489
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,559
Our government is like a coward,

490
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,559
what did they need so many soldiers for?

491
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,800
They say the soldiers' lives matter a lot,

492
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,719
but many of them were sent to encircle communists.

493
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,679
They dare not fight against the Japanese,

494
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,800
but kill common Chinese people at will.

495
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,559
Stop saying anything like this.

496
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,239
If Discipline Department knows, you'll be punished.

497
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,320
Lu Ziyi now works at that Department.

498
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,280
so there are growing tensions in our school.

499
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,440
One more thing.

500
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,599
Nianqiao.

501
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,519
What did they want to know during those days

502
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,800
when they interrogated you?

503
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,599
They kept asking me

504
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:33,239
if I am close to Professor Jin of Fuhua University.

505
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,159
Defend. Defend.

506
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,719
Who is this lady?

507
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,920
I've never seen her before.

508
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:02,880
You'd ask Captain.

509
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,360
Ding Huansheng.

510
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,480
The fiancee from Beiping.

511
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,639
They meant no defense, just for joking.

512
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,920
Stop it.

513
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,880
Warm up, now.

514
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,760
Haitang. Sit down.

515
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,840
Take some photos for us later.

516
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,880
Hanguang Squadron is the ace of Republic of China,

517
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,199
and they bring such a beauty to us.

518
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,440
The war is around the corner.

519
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,360
You live only once to see such a wonderful woman.

520
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Defend. Defend.

521
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,880
Nice shot.

522
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,199
Try again.

523
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,079
Good job.

524
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,079
Nice shot.

525
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:03,559
Give it to me.

526
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,760
One more shot.

527
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,920
Good shot.

528
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,239
Come on.

529
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,599
Don't worry. I'll fetch it.

530
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,199
Hurry. Go.

531
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:33,880
I'll get it.

532
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,599
Hey, girl.

533
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,400
Come to cheer for me.

534
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,599
I'll be gentle to you tonight.

535
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,719
What are you saying?

536
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,599
What's wrong with you?

537
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,639
What's your problem?

538
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,480
Shut you mouth.

539
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,280
You're done.

540
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,320
How dare you?

541
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,039
You want to die?

542
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,000
What?

543
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,960
What's your problem?

544
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,360
Are you crazy?

545
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,440
Shut up.

546
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,760
Stop it. Stop.

547
00:38:59,079 --> 00:38:59,840
Don't move, now.

548
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,719
What's going on?

549
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,960
They insulted her first.

550
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,079
So what?

551
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,320
What do you want?

552
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,760
So what do you want?

553
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,960
You came for this.

554
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
What do you ask for?

555
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,159
Well, that's enough.

556
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,199
I was thinking who was the bastard there.

557
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:12,920
What did you mean?

558
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,599
What did you say?

559
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,679
Officers from Political Discipline Department.

560
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,960
My apologies for getting the wrong person.

561
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,599
Why do we fight here?

562
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,440
We should fight on field.

563
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,920
As you wish. Let's go.

564
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,119
Go.

565
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,480
Nice.

566
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,159
Nice shot.

567
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,239
It's a foul.

568
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,519
What's it?

569
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,199
What were you doing?

570
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:01,880
What's wrong?

571
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,559
You know the rules?

572
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,159
What's wrong?

573
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:03,679
Captain.

574
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,960
It's not a fair play.

575
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:05,760
He Yan.

576
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,039
Jin Chao and He Yan

577
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,599
replace Chen Ran and Kejing.

578
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,599
Are you alright?

579
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,239
It's okay.

580
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,239
Great! Nice shot.

581
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,320
Jin Chao and He Yan are like the twins.

582
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,599
Secret weapons for Captain.

583
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,119
They can perform perfect teamwork.

584
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,440
Nice shot.

585
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,079
Great. Amazing.

586
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,880
Nice shot.

587
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,559
Last 10 seconds.

588
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,920
66 versus 67.

589
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,599
Nice shot.

590
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,559
We are the winners.
