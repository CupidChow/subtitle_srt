00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 08]

3
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,640
Good job!

4
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,400
Are you all right?

5
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,359
Captain Zhang.

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,040
Just you wait.

7
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,120
This isn't over.

8
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,560
We'll wait!

9
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,480
Always be ready to fight.

10
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,560
That's Hanguang's slogan.

11
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,560
Officers, excuse us!

12
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,159
Excuse us!

13
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,239
Poshan, I haven't asked you.

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
How's Father been since I left?

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,000
Same as usual.

16
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,200
He's always angry.

17
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,680
He even beat me up before I left.

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,480
He doesn't want you to leave.

19
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,319
Now you finally got what you wanted.

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
You've always wanted to come to Jianqiao.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
By the way, Haitang,

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,879
you've become a young lady

23
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,840
since I last saw you.

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,439
When I left,

25
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,240
you were only about this high.

26
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,199
Tell me about it.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,919
Qianying nearly cried her eyes out

28
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,800
after you left Peiping.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,280
You liked to carry her around
when you were a child.

30
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,039
Do you still remember?

31
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,000
Of course I remember.

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,479
Oh, Haitang,

33
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,039
you and our captain are...

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,759
Nianqiao, Poshan.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,960
Are you free tomorrow night?

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,879
I'll treat you to dinner.

37
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,599
Tomorrow night?

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,919
Dinner...

39
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,599
You still owe me money for the milk.

40
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,960
Where would you get spare cash?

41
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,159
Here's an idea.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,919
Tonight, I'll treat everyone to dinner for you.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520
- Good!
- Good!

44
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,400
Everyone,

45
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,560
we will prevail!

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,919
Let's take a group picture together.

47
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,520
We will prevail!

48
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,879
We will prevail!

49
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,400
I'm coming.

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Here, to Nianqiao's return.

51
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,199
Welcome back!

52
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,479
Guys,

53
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,199
we're all soldiers.

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,840
Peiping and Tianjin have fallen.

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,960
Japan is sending more troops to Shanghai.

56
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,240
It's going to be a big battle.

57
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,759
To our victory.

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,199
To our victory.

59
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,159
To our victory.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,400
To our victory.

61
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,280
To our victory.

62
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,199
Come on, fill it up.

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
Alright, stop looking.

64
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,560
Let me introduce.

65
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,319
Meng Haitang,

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,879
a student at Fuhua University.

67
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,319
She's about to be a history major or...

68
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:09,960
History.

69
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,039
History.

70
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,639
Me and Haitang grew up together.

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,879
She's like my own sister.

72
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,680
At an early age, she studied

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,480
oracle bone script from the best,

74
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,439
and is quite accomplished.

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,480
Her brother serves in

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,959
The 29th Military Academy Corps.

77
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,199
Now he's recovering in Hangzhou.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,360
As his sister,

79
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,000
Haitang came to look after him.

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,079
That's the whole story.

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,720
Captain.

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,639
I'm sure there's more to the story.

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,480
We've all read the newspaper,

84
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,079
saying who's whose fiancee!

85
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,480
I asked the press service
to take all the papers back.

86
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,319
How did you see it?

87
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,920
And, for your information,

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
we're not engaged.

89
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,959
Did that disappoint you?

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,800
It didn't.

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,399
Instead, it gave us aspirations.

92
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:48,839
Right, guys?

93
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,879
We're more thrilled.

94
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,439
What's wrong with your neck?

95
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,920
Which girl left this mark?

96
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,319
I just can't help it.

97
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,800
I like both of them.

98
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,639
But they fought each other when they met.

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
I tried to stop them,

100
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,959
but she scratched my neck.

101
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,680
That's not my fault.

102
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,720
Here we go again.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This Chen Ran

104
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,279
is such a playboy.

105
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,600
Ding Huansheng,

106
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,360
vice-captain of Hanguang Squadron.

107
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,480
We all call him second elder brother.

108
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,399
Second elder brother.

109
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,600
Miss Meng.

110
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,319
Yu Kejing.

111
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,759
Miss Meng.

112
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,360
Nicknamed Mr. Jing.

113
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
He's always the good cop.

114
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,600
Hi, Kejing.

115
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,360
How's your nose now?

116
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,000
It's fine.

117
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,040
Though it doesn't look pretty,

118
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,480
it's still functional.

119
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,800
Xu Hanxun.

120
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,920
A crybaby.

121
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,519
Get out...

122
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,399
Why did you hit me?

123
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,839
You cried for three days

124
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,120
after your mom came to visit.

125
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,759
Hello, Hanxun.

126
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,800
Thank you for today.

127
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,079
No thanks. It was nothing.

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,920
Jin Chao and He Yan.

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,000
They are...

130
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,439
What are you doing?

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,920
I know them.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,639
The twins in Hanguang,

133
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,600
but they have different last names.

134
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,040
- We're closer than twin brothers.
- We're closer than twin brothers.

135
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,000
Hi, Chao and Yan.

136
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,639
Let's start eating.

137
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,240
You must be hungry.

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,920
Alright.

139
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,439
Come on.

140
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,079
We're starving.

141
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,319
Come on.

142
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,160
Here.

143
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,519
The iron tree is finally in blossom.

144
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,199
Everyone knows

145
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,839
our captain is an eagle born to fly.

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,279
He can stay in the sky all the time

147
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,639
without eating and sleeping.

148
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,639
Huansheng, Nianqiao and us are like the caretakers.

149
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
He only eats something

150
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,160
when Huansheng offers him food.

151
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
It would not surprise me

152
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,759
if he eats the sand

153
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,920
Huansheng gives to him instead of the rice.

154
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,160
He isn't a fool.

155
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
He's picky about food.

156
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,879
You guys just don't know it.

157
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,959
I've never seen you

158
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,120
serve other people.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
She's different from all the other ones.

160
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,000
She's special.

161
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,920
What are you talking about?

162
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,959
Miss Haitang.

163
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,199
Perhaps you don't know.

164
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,839
I'm a girl pleaser.

165
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,319
But Captain is a girl-rejecter.

166
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,120
He was hovered around by 18 admirers

167
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,079
but he didn't give a single chance

168
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,759
to any of them.

169
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,759
He's had my respect.

170
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,160
Alright, Miss Meng.

171
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,720
We all like to joke around with Captain.

172
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,279
He seldom loses his temper.

173
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,759
But you were going too far.

174
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,680
Hey, listen,

175
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,000
Haitang and Haichen's father

176
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,319
trusted them to me.

177
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,879
They're like my own brother and sister.

178
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,839
You guys should treat them the same way.

179
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,399
We're close to war.

180
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,680
If you have the energy,

181
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,839
work on your battling skills

182
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,600
or learn how to fly.

183
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,560
Speaking of battling skills,

184
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,879
Captain is the best at low-altitude flight.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,399
But in terms of luck,

186
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,279
I'm better than him.

187
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,199
Yeah.

188
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:52,920
Am I right?

189
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,199
Yes, of course.

190
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,519
Excuse me,

191
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,240
which one is Zhang Qi?

192
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,439
It's me.

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,839
It's investigated

194
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,920
that you disobeyed a military order

195
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,439
when evacuating from
Nanyuan Airport in Peiping.

196
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,040
You're under provisional detention,

197
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,000
and will be punished

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
after receiving the verification
by the Political Discipline Department.

199
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,360
Will Captain be in danger?

200
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,680
The war is coming,

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,319
and he's a flying ace.

202
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,360
The Political Discipline Department

203
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
won't do anything to hurt him.

204
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,600
Besides, Minister of Education is in Nanjing.

205
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,000
He should be taking some action.

206
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,600
Huansheng,

207
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
I think the Political
Discipline Department did that

208
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,360
just to reduce Minister's pride.

209
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,639
Jianqiao is surrounded by mountains,

210
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,399
and Chiang Kai-shek places his attention

211
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,320
on Central Aviation School.

212
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,759
But the more he values it,
the more suspicious he'll get.

213
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,879
The Political Discipline Department
first made a move on me,

214
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,480
and then on Captain.

215
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,080
It seems like a small step,

216
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,480
but to me,

217
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,399
they are fatiguing us.

218
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,159
Yeah.

219
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,279
Our battling skills

220
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,320
will be greatly affected

221
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,240
if they try to fatigue us.

222
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,919
Oh, right.

223
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,759
The underground party in Peiping

224
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,399
gave me instructions.

225
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,240
Zhang Qi applied for party membership

226
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,240
through a left-wing association at Fuhua

227
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,519
when he was at school.

228
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,879
He's been trying to join the party.

229
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,200
The party wants us

230
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,440
to observe and admit him.

231
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,720
I know Captain very well.

232
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,720
On our attitude towards the Japanese,

233
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,639
he's always favored war.

234
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,639
He's resolute and daring

235
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,159
like a guiding tower.

236
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,399
I observed him over and over.

237
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,399
It's good that

238
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,799
the party wants us to get him in.

239
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm thinking the same.

240
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,240
Not only should we admit him,

241
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,120
we will lead everyone in Jianqiao

242
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,559
to rise up against the Japanese.

243
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,919
All the pilots in Jianqiao

244
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,159
don't deserve to be casualties

245
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,159
of the nationalist partisan division.

246
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,440
Huansheng,

247
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
let's crack down on the doves

248
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
and support the hawks.

249
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,919
We should ignite the feelings of patriotism.

250
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,159
Oh, Huansheng,

251
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,840
see with your sharp eyes

252
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,399
who favors a war

253
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,399
and needs our support.

254
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,960
Through my observation,

255
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,240
Yu Kejing

256
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,039
could be one of them.

257
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,679
Open the door.

258
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,759
Minister.

259
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,120
Be seated.

260
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,519
Why did you make such a huge mistake

261
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,039
when retrieving the Fuxing airplane?

262
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,799
Minister.

263
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,559
I failed to complete my task.

264
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,080
Fuxing No. 023 was blown up

265
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,840
under the pressure of war.

266
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
What about No. 024?

267
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,799
People from Political Discipline Department

268
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,720
accused you of blowing up the plane

269
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,440
to hide the evidence of smuggling.

270
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,279
Using a military plane to smuggle and destroying it,

271
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,600
both of the charges

272
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,320
are capital offense.

273
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,840
On the day of the test flight,

274
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,600
the bilge of Fuxing No. 023 was remodeled

275
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,480
and two boxes of engraved
oracle bones were hidden in it.

276
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,639
During the flight,

277
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,879
a fuel leak occurred.

278
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,840
That day, I took one box of the stolen goods

279
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,440
and turned it over to Peiping Aviation Defense.

280
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,639
On the eve of the 28th,

281
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,559
No. 024 exploded

282
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,360
when I just got to Qinghe Airport.

283
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,639
But after the explosion,

284
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,519
I saw someone carrying

285
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,279
that two boxes of oracle bones away.

286
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
According to their conversation,

287
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,320
I tracked down their trading place

288
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,759
on the next day

289
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,039
and got the goods back.

290
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,639
These can be used as physical evidence

291
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,759
for the school to investigate.

292
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,320
But sir,

293
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,759
I heard them mention

294
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,159
Deputy Director Lu.

295
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,200
They were all behind the explosion
at the airport.

296
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Also,

297
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,639
they're related to the Political Discipline Department
of the Central Aviation School.

298
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,960
I guess

299
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,639
Lu Ziyi, the Deputy Director of the department,

300
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,759
uses his office to smuggle

301
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,480
through military aircraft.

302
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,960
To hide his crime,

303
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,799
he damaged military equipment.

304
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,600
Are you sure Lu Ziyi is involved

305
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,039
in this case?

306
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,440
I am.

307
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,399
I stalked a man in Peiping.

308
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,080
He's got a mole on his arm

309
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,759
and is named Xu Te.

310
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,679
He was transferred to Jianqiao
from the Aviation Council

311
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,600
together with Lu Ziyi.

312
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,120
They're in smuggling operations,

313
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,120
and probably have colluded with the Japanese.

314
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,519
It is treason.

315
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,600
Minister,

316
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,279
please have a thorough investigation.

317
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Did you actually see Lu Ziyi

318
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,480
commit treason?

319
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,120
Do you have any evidence?

320
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,559
I don't.

321
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,480
Zhang Qi.

322
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,120
What's the most dangerous to a soldier?

323
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,639
Foolhardiness

324
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,559
and blindness.

325
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,039
You've still got a long way to go

326
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,720
to be an excellent soldier.

327
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,679
Reflect on yourself.

328
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,840
I'll rest this case here

329
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,639
and exercise discretion

330
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,000
in their investigate on you.

331
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,879
I'll take my leave.

332
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,039
I'm new in the Aviation School,

333
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,080
but I've been doing everything

334
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,720
by the disciplines in the air force,

335
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,159
and treating everyone fair and kindly.

336
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,919
Zhang Qi accused me

337
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,120
of collaborating with
the Political Discipline Department

338
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,279
and smuggling antiquities.

339
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,919
It's a capital offense.

340
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
If Minister didn't help,

341
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,919
I would assume

342
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,120
that Zhang Qi

343
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,679
is dooming me to death.

344
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,720
Deputy Director Lu,

345
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,559
Zhang Qi was suffering a head injury

346
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,919
and might had mistaken someone else for you.

347
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,600
Please be kind enough to forgive him.

348
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,279
But

349
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,480
the Political Discipline Department
has held him for a few days.

350
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,039
This kid is stubborn,

351
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,320
and insensible.

352
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,120
He deserves to suffer for it.

353
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,399
But then again,

354
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,320
you told me he smuggled goods

355
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,639
through the plane his father gave him as a gift

356
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,240
and blew up No. 024

357
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,879
to ruin the evidence.

358
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
That doesn't make any sense.

359
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Zhang Qi found

360
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,480
the smuggled goods hidden in No. 023

361
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,879
and asked Ding Huansheng

362
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,159
to turn them over to
the Peiping Aviation Defense.

363
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,039
If he meant to smuggle,

364
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
he wouldn't expose himself like that.

365
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,559
From where I stand,

366
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,720
a war is approaching,

367
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,879
and it was a shame that

368
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,360
No. 023 got destroyed.

369
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
But it was a war consumable.

370
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,200
I suggest

371
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,000
that we let it pass.

372
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,600
Mr. Tang,

373
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,559
as you introduced to me,

374
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,399
Captain Zhang's father

375
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,840
is Zhang Buchun,

376
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,080
a wealthy businessman who donates airplanes.

377
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,159
A business man donates airplanes and smuggles,

378
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,559
and his pilot son flies the plane.

379
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:05,879
It's quite obvious.

380
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,639
I'm not being unreasonable.

381
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,240
He's the one picking on me

382
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,759
and taking a false charge against me!

383
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,720
He called me a smuggler.

384
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,799
On what grounds?

385
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,159
Just by a man with a mole?

386
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,039
How ridiculous!

387
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,639
Fine.

388
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,240
I can draw a mole

389
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,080
on my hand right now.

390
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,679
Tell him to use it

391
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:26,960
to accuse me!

392
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,120
Deputy Director Lu,

393
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,240
please calm down.

394
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
You're the pillar of the party and the country,

395
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,240
but he's only a kid.

396
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,840
Don't sink to his level.

397
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,879
And what's more,

398
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,679
we're going to have a war.

399
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,960
Hanguang Squadron will go to the front.

400
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,399
We don't have to

401
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,039
dwell ourselves on such a trifle.

402
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,919
Deputy Director Lu,

403
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,440
if you can let him off,

404
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,240
I guarantee you

405
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,240
I'll take care of this for you.

406
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,320
Take care of this for me?

407
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,000
He's the one being grounded, not me!

408
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,559
Deputy Director Lu,

409
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,360
it's fine that some cases
are left uninvestigated.

410
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,639
But once we start to investigate,

411
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,799
a lot of people will get involved.

412
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,759
You know what they say,

413
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,960
the fresh radish come out with mud.

414
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,879
If we can learn to turn a blind eye,

415
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,639
we don't have to alert the superiors.

416
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,279
Deputy Director Lu,

417
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,879
if you can do me the honor,

418
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,480
I'll help you remove the radish.

419
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,879
Mr. Tang.

420
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,200
I've always had clean hands

421
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,120
from the Central Aviation Council

422
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,759
to the Aviation School.

423
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,919
I'm not afraid of the investigation.

424
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,159
But the war is coming,

425
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,799
our Political Discipline Department

426
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,080
should put a priority on
strengthening our fighting capacity.

427
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
I will do you this honor.

428
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,559
I was just grumbling about it.

429
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,519
Just let it slide.

430
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,679
Good.

431
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,600
We'll let it slide.

432
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,039
Neither of us will bring this up again.

433
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,399
Try my new tea.

434
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,640
Luckily, you helped out in time.

435
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,680
I send you to the Aviation School

436
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,240
to work for me,

437
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
not to cause trouble.

438
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,400
Yes.

439
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,279
I'll be extra careful.

440
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,119
Okayama has taken
the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

441
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,279
back to Japan for authentication.

442
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Ling Wenyue and Meng Wuran

443
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,480
have both escaped from Peiping.

444
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,680
Their family

445
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,160
are now settling in Hangzhou.

446
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,160
If the inscriptions are authentic,

447
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,200
it'll be easy to handle.

448
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,359
But if they are fake,

449
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,640
it will get tough.

450
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,240
Keep an eye on these people

451
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,279
and plant some moles among them.

452
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,119
Do you hear me?

453
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,960
Yes.

454
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,079
Thief! What are you stealing?

455
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,119
Only half of a steamed bun.

456
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,480
I've got nothing else.

457
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Search me if you want.

458
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,480
Why do you become a thief

459
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,359
at such a young age?

460
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,319
How old are you?

461
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,480
16.

462
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,279
Only two months shy.

463
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,440
You're younger than Haichen.

464
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:04,920
Where are your parents?

465
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,839
You don't sound like a local.

466
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,720
I don't have a dad.

467
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,880
My mom got lost.

468
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,599
I came to Hangzhou to look for my brother,

469
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,680
but I haven't found him.

470
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,480
Madam, you look like a kind person.

471
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,279
I'm on my knees.

472
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,279
Please forgive me.

473
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm begging you.

474
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,880
I'll never steal again.

475
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,920
Please let me go, will you?

476
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,039
You have a big mouth.

477
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,519
You ate half of the bun in one bite?

478
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,759
I can eat it all in one gulp.

479
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,000
Madam, I'm just too hungry

480
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and want to find some food.

481
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,119
Please let me go.

482
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,640
Mrs. Gao,

483
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,359
he looks miserable.

484
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,759
Why don't we let him go?

485
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,599
Alright, get up.

486
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,200
Thank you. Thank you.

487
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,400
Wait.

488
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,960
What is it, Madam?

489
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,480
Here, take these buns.

490
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,079
Sound like you're from Peiping.

491
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,359
There's a war going on up north.

492
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,400
I guess you're fleeing war, too.

493
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
But you gave me your food.

494
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,599
Thank you, Madam.

495
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,079
Thank you.

496
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:31,960
Wait.

497
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,039
Use the front door.

498
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,640
Don't climb out the window again.

499
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,960
Oh, I forgot.

500
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,680
Sir, I'll take this book.

501
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,519
The Sorrows of Young Werther.

502
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,319
OK, just a second.

503
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,400
Excuse me.

504
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,440
I picked out the books on the counter.

505
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,359
Sorry, sir.

506
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:25,680
Miss,

507
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,119
please find another one

508
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,000
on the shelf over there.

509
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,400
Sir.

510
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,440
I didn't see this book on the shelf.

511
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,000
Sorry, Miss,

512
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,440
I guess it has run out of stock.

513
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,359
Miss.

514
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:49,599
Take this.

515
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,519
That won't do.

516
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,240
You were here first.

517
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,480
It's fine.

518
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,599
I'm sent by the school to buy those books.

519
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,920
This is the only one I want to read.

520
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,359
Read it first if you like it.

521
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,960
I'll give you money.

522
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,680
No need. It's a gift.

523
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,200
Hang on.

524
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,400
It's popular to copy books now.

525
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,799
This one doesn't have many pages.

526
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,119
I can copy it out for you.

527
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,160
Meanwhile,

528
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,640
I can learn how to write.

529
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,160
May I have your name and address?

530
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,480
Once I finish one chapter,

531
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,519
I'll send it to you.

532
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,880
OK.

533
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:30,799
Sir.

534
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,160
Do you have a pen and paper?

535
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,359
Suit yourself.

536
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:47,680
Here.

537
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,480
Zeng Poshan.

538
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,559
Jianqiao Central Aviation School.

539
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,720
So you're a pilot!

540
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm only a flying cadet.

541
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,680
My name is Xu Yuanyin.

542
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,000
Yuan means prettiness

543
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,480
and Yin means luxuriant.

544
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,200
Nice to meet you.

545
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,839
I'll take my leave.

546
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,119
Thanks.

547
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,400
My pleasure.

548
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,680
Zeng Poshan.

549
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,599
The books are all wet.

550
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:44,839
Thank you.

551
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,759
No worries. Where are you going?

552
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,000
Back to school.

553
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,599
It's on my way.

554
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Why don't you walk with me?

555
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,599
Thanks.

556
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
Are you from the north?

557
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah.

558
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,000
It often rains in the south.

559
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,440
You should learn to look at the weather

560
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,000
and always bring an umbrella.

561
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,400
I've kept in mind.

562
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,119
I'm home.

563
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,640
You can take this umbrella.

564
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,240
I guess we'll have a second chance to meet.

565
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,839
That's too kind of you.

566
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
I'm not afraid of getting wet.

567
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,920
But you're in the air force.

568
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,920
What if you catch a chill
and affect your training?

569
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,359
The rain in the south

570
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
is much colder than that in your hometown.

571
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,079
Then I'll walk with you to your door.

572
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
No, thanks. I have pretty strict upbringing.

573
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,240
Let's part here.

574
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,240
Mom, I'm back.

575
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,480
My girl.

576
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Come on.

577
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,599
What happened?

578
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,000
Why are you bathing in the rain?

579
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,039
Where's the umbrella?

580
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Well, I left it in the book store.

581
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,799
Come on, get changed now.

582
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,759
Don't catch a cold.

583
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,759
Read it first

584
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,119
if you like it.

585
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,720
I'll give you money.

586
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,559
No need.

587
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,599
It's a gift.

588
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,920
Mr. Xu,

589
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,640
I'll repeat that once again.

590
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,559
I'm a real professor of physics

591
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,160
at Fuhua University.

592
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,519
I... I lost

593
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,519
the shoes while I was fleeing.

594
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,720
But that's nothing.

595
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,119
Even if I lose one arm,

596
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,519
I can still get paid at Fuhua University.

597
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,119
I don't get it.

598
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
You put posters about

599
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,400
renting the five rooms.

600
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,880
It's not like we don't pay you.

601
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,680
Why don't you rent them to us?

602
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,640
You want short term rentals.

603
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,119
And you're even not sure

604
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,920
whether you'll rent it

605
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,880
for one or two months.

606
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,519
We'll pay the bill anyway.

607
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm renting the whole house

608
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,400
for at least one year.

609
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,839
You should pay one year's rent to me
even if you rent it for one month.

610
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,160
That's robbery.

611
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,039
What kind of attitude is that?

612
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:46,680
Well...

613
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,400
It's my house,

614
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,319
I can rent it as I please.

615
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,599
That doesn't make sense.

616
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,119
Where do you get this attitude?

617
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,839
Enough, don't argue.

618
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,599
Please don't be mad.

619
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,240
We're making a deal

620
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,640
and we can talk it out.

621
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,200
Whether it's for two months or one year,

622
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,359
you'll be renting it anyway.

623
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,000
Just make us an offer.

624
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,839
This isn't about money.

625
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,240
I'll get straight to you.

626
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,000
My house is only rented

627
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,799
to professors at universities.

628
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,279
I'm also a professor.

629
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,759
But I have no idea

630
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,079
if you're telling the truth.

631
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,920
It's true! I'm a real professor!

632
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,759
How can you prove

633
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,640
that you're a real professor?

634
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,279
Well...

635
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,640
Listen to me.

636
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,240
I never bring myself trouble.

637
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,119
Alright?

638
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,799
After you finish drinking the tea,

639
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,279
please leave.

640
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,519
I'll tell you again.

641
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
I'm a real professor of physics

642
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,279
at Fuhua University.

643
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,519
Let's go.

644
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,240
Come on.

645
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,200
Let's go.

646
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,820
[Xu's Mansion]

647
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,359
I can't believe him!

648
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,519
You...

649
00:27:59,039 --> 00:27:59,839
Mom!

650
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,079
Qianying!

651
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,279
Come on in.

652
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,799
Girl, what brings you here again?

653
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Go back and tell Mrs. Gao

654
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,359
that I'm not renting the house.

655
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,720
Sir, sorry. I was wrong.

656
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,440
What's wrong?

657
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,920
This does not concern you.

658
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,960
I shouldn't have stolen your edamame.

659
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,880
Um...

660
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,920
Sir, I'm terribly sorry.

661
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,519
She's my daughter

662
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,480
and she stole some edamames from you.

663
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,880
I failed to teach her well.

664
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,319
Now we're here to apologize.

665
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,200
This girl must be hungry.

666
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,480
That wasn't stealing.

667
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,480
Well...

668
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Come on, girl.

669
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,720
Have a seat.

670
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:16,880
Sit down.

671
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,799
Excuse me.

672
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
Come on, be seated, too.

673
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,680
If you like it,

674
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
I have some more here.

675
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Mom, you first.

676
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,480
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

677
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:36,880
Look.

678
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,759
What a sweet girl.

679
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,079
I should rent this house for her sake.

680
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,920
But I really don't like those two people.

681
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,000
The three families of us

682
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,240
fled from Peiping all the way to here.

683
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,640
I went to Nanjing on an errand

684
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,559
and left my daughter

685
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,359
to Professor Zeng and Mrs. Gao.

686
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
She's naughty

687
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,880
and always brings them trouble.

688
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,119
So you're saying

689
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,359
that guy really is a professor.

690
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:05,960
Yes.

691
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,839
Professor Zeng

692
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,000
teaches physics in the science department

693
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,759
of Fuhua University.

694
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,480
I'm also a teacher there.

695
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:11,759
I teach Chinese.

696
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
You're also a professor?

697
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,519
Oh, how do I address you?

698
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
My name is Kang Lanshan.

699
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,200
Kang Lanshan.

700
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,720
No way. You're Ms. Kang,

701
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,319
the author of this novel,

702
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,599
The Modest Room?

703
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,119
I wrote that years ago.

704
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,559
It isn't very good. Please don't laugh.

705
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,880
What's not to like this book?

706
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,160
You know what?

707
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
I've read this book

708
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,559
for more than ten times.

709
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,720
It's intriguing.

710
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,160
I didn't expect

711
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,319
to have this honor

712
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,680
to meet you in person.

713
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,599
I'm telling you,

714
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
your husband, Mr. Ling Wenyue,

715
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,079
is also legendary.

716
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,200
The professors who lived next to me

717
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,359
talked about

718
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,160
you and your husband all the time.

719
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,680
No, you're flattering me.

720
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,640
No, no, no.

721
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,279
Ms. Kang, have you found a place to live

722
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,599
here in Hangzhou?

723
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,839
I just remembered

724
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,839
I have an empty house next door.

725
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,799
If you like,

726
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,039
you can rent it in any way you want.

727
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,400
And you can live here

728
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,519
for one or two months.

729
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,839
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

730
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,359
Mom.

731
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,079
What are you sighing about?

732
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,759
What happened?

733
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,640
Your dad asked Professor Zhou

734
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
to give us 150 yuan a month

735
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,319
as our living expense.

736
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,680
I just went to see him

737
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,000
but was told that he's left school

738
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,880
and gone to Zhengde.

739
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,880
I can't find him now.

740
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,799
If I had known about it,

741
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,839
I wouldn't have rented
such an expensive apartment.

742
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,079
Qianying's family can afford it,

743
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,359
but we can't.

744
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,519
This month's rent

745
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,640
plus the medical bills for Haichen

746
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,319
will leave us penniless.

747
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,400
Then should we tell Ms. Kang about it?

748
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,279
Let's find a cheaper place and move out.

749
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,039
Just live here for one month.

750
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,240
I'll find some work to do later.

751
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,799
Come in.

752
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,400
Miss, you're here.

753
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,319
Excuse me.

754
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,039
Come on.

755
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,079
It's steamed lion’s head meatballs

756
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,160
my mom made for me.

757
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,759
She asked me to give you some.

758
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,039
Thanks.

759
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,039
There are three bowls

760
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,240
for each of you.

761
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,440
This is so nice of you.

762
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,319
Thanks.

763
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,200
When Ms. Kang and Mr. Zeng return,

764
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,960
we shall split it up.

765
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,240
I'm going to heat it up.

766
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:44,799
Have a seat.

767
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,440
Thanks.

768
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,240
I'm Meng Haitang,

769
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,000
a student at Fuhua University in Peiping.

770
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,519
What about you?

771
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:51,920
Xu Yuanyin.

772
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,359
I'll start my first year as a history student.

773
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:55,559
Really?

774
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,759
I was going to study history, too.

775
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,079
But my family

776
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,279
wants me to go to the normal school.

777
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,960
My dad used to run a school.

778
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,559
This building you live in

779
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,720
used to be a school.

780
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,599
Later, he began to sell gauze

781
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,519
and the school was closed.

782
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,559
During every summer and winter vacation,

783
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:14,960
I open some courses temporarily

784
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,759
in Xu Village.

785
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,119
There are many kids here

786
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,839
who haven't got a chance to go to school.

787
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,200
I teach them some courses.

788
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,519
What? Did I say something wrong?

789
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,799
No, no.

790
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,920
Um,

791
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,440
are you still short

792
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,559
on substitute teachers
during this summer vacation?

793
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,720
I worked as a teacher

794
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,559
back in Peiping,

795
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,640
and I ran Haiyu School once.

796
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,160
It's just

797
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,880
my family has been having a hard time.

798
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,440
I want to help with the family expenses.

799
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,759
There were

800
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,519
many teachers from in Xu Village.

801
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,400
But they have moved away

802
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,720
for these months.

803
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,480
Now no one is here to teach the kids.

804
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,319
Why don't we open the classes together?

805
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,079
We'll charge the students

806
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
who can afford to pay

807
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,319
to make ends meet.

808
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
And we'll also take students

809
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,960
with financial problems.

810
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,799
And we can still use the name Haiyu School.

811
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:04,759
Good.

812
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,639
A thousand books to accompany me.

813
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:09,639
Nice.

814
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,800
Why are the girls even here?

815
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,199
I'll do it. I will.

816
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,760
Mr. Xu.

817
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,159
What does it say?

818
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,639
A cluster of flowers to enjoy.

819
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,159
All right.

820
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,079
Hurry, put it on.

821
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:20,960
Come on.

822
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,760
How nice.

823
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,280
Give it to me.

824
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,519
OK.

825
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,199
Let me help.

826
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,719
OK.

827
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,519
Come on, let me.

828
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,119
Let me.

829
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,199
Can you do this?

830
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,239
Why can't...

831
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,800
Look.

832
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,840
Don't look down on me.

833
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,119
I'm a real professor.

834
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,000
This will make my day.

835
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,400
Come on.

836
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,360
Get the paste for me.

837
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,119
All right.

838
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,119
Ladies and gentlemen,

839
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,760
Haiyu School was run in Peiping,

840
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,760
and it consists some enlightenment courses

841
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,360
opened by us students at Fuhua University.

842
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,880
Because of the Japanese invasion,

843
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,679
the school was shut down.

844
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
But today,

845
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,880
it is reopened officially in Hangzhou.

846
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,079
Good!

847
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,639
This is Miss Meng Haitang of Haiyu School.

848
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,000
She came from Peiping.

849
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,400
She's too young to teach.

850
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,960
Yes, I doubt her ability.

851
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,960
She's young in age,

852
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,519
but she's born in a literary family.

853
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,639
You can rest assured

854
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:27,920
as long as the teacher is knowledgeable and virtuous.

855
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,719
Right, I agree.

856
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,159
Today

857
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,760
me and Yuanyin start the classes.

858
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,000
We'll teach from this book,
Perfected Admiration of Ancient Literature.

859
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,119
The tuition fees are cheap

860
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,719
and I'm sure you'll learn a lot from us.

861
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,480
Will Ms. Kang be teaching?

862
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,159
Ms. Kang goes to Nanjing every week.

863
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,119
She's leaving tomorrow,

864
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,599
so she won't have time to teach.

865
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,000
However,

866
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,800
Haiyu School

867
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,880
also offers other courses.

868
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,599
Miss Xu teaches math.

869
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,920
Mr. Zeng teaches physics.

870
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,559
What's to learn about physics?

871
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,440
It's so hard.

872
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,679
And I don't think it'll come in handy.

873
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,039
What's not to learn about physics?

874
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,400
There're so many things to learn!

875
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,039
How would farmers

876
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,199
learn about the good-for-nothing?

877
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,239
I won't let my kid learn it.

878
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,159
I don't see any good teachers

879
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,719
in this Haiyu School.

880
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,360
It's not easy to make money.

881
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,960
I say we should forget about it.

882
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,360
What are you talking about?

883
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,400
Never try to teach a pig to sing.

884
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,519
We're crazy busy.

885
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,480
Come on, let's go.

886
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,000
Don't leave.

887
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,840
Go and do farm work.

888
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,239
Please don't leave.

889
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,800
Zhang Qi.

890
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,039
Nianqiao.

891
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,440
How did you come here?

892
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,760
Our training is over.

893
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:29,920
Father.

894
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,400
Sir.

895
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:32,800
Father.

896
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,800
You went to see me and Poshan

897
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
but we were in training.

898
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,719
Luckily,

899
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,119
you left an address to the gatekeeper.

900
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,840
Our captain knows about it

901
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,800
and came to visit everyone.

902
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,199
Why is he leaving?

903
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,039
Everyone,

904
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:54,239
other than Chinese and math classes,

905
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,280
what do you think

906
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,119
if we add two more teachers?

907
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,480
Two more?

908
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,559
It's good though, but we'll have to pay more.

909
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,960
I, Captain of Hanguang Squadron, Zhang Qi,

910
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,000
will teach you drawing,

911
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,159
handwork and music.

912
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,079
Warfare Officer of Hanguang Squadron,
Zeng Nianqiao,

913
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,639
will teach you history and sports.

914
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:14,840
Do you want your kids

915
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,000
to come and learn from us?

916
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,519
We do, but...

917
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,960
I'm giving a quick shoutout.

918
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,920
Our Haiyu School

919
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,440
is honored to help those poor but aspiring kids.

920
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,719
If you sign up now,

921
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,239
the tuition fees are waived.

922
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,639
That's great!

923
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,239
Moreover,

924
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,760
you'll even get payments.

925
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,559
I'll be the one providing it.

926
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:37,039
What do you think?

927
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:37,679
Wonderful!

928
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,920
Good, good!

929
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,599
Tomorrow

930
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,360
I'll start our first music class.

931
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:46,960
How about it?

932
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,639
Excellent!

933
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,159
Father.

934
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,360
I bought these green bean cakes

935
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
in Zhiwei Shop.

936
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,400
Where's Poshan?

937
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,119
He's in the enlistment camp.

938
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,719
How has he been?

939
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,480
He's been great.

940
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,199
The other day,

941
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,280
he impressed everyone

942
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,480
in the basketball game with us.

943
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,760
Your school is pretty arrogant.

944
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,800
I went to see my own son

945
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,599
but they didn't let me.

946
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,199
Why didn't he come back with you?

947
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,239
Only you came alone.

948
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,360
Father,

949
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,960
we're under strict administration,

950
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,679
especially in the enlistment camp.

951
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,199
They're having fully closed training.

952
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,679
I think

953
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,280
he can come to visit you in a few days.

954
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,480
Father.

955
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,519
We haven't seen each other for five years.

956
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,159
How's your health?

957
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,840
I'm just a broken-down old buffer.

958
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,119
Why do you care?

959
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,440
Nianqiao.

960
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:06,840
I told you

961
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,159
on the year you joined the army.

962
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,440
Don't call me Father.

963
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,239
You're not my son.

964
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,079
From now on,

965
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,800
just call me Uncle.

966
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,119
Father.

967
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,920
You're still mad at me.

968
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,280
Have you read the letter I wrote you?

969
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,719
I do care about you

970
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,360
and I miss you every day.

971
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,440
How about this?

972
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,039
I'll come to keep you company

973
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,000
whenever I'm free.

974
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,880
Is it alright?

975
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,760
Don't stray far from home
when your parents are alive.

976
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,599
When you left home,

977
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,519
did you consider how that might make me feel?

978
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,400
Look at you.

979
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,599
How tanned have you got

980
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,920
since you joined the army?

981
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,000
Take care of yourself in the future.

982
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
I won't care about you.

983
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,239
During the battle,

984
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:20,519
the main force

985
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,159
assists the army in the true north

986
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:24,280
and the First Division assists the navy

987
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,320
to face the enemy.

988
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,880
Prepare heavy bombardment

989
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,360
to attack the enemy's resources,

990
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,760
as well as their naval and air force bases,

991
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:33,360
such as Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama,

992
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,800
Sasebo Port,

993
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,159
the arsenal in Liaoning, and Taiwan

994
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,639
to have a freedom of movement in the air.

995
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,079
This is

996
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,440
Plan B of the Defense Operations.

997
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,840
I've finished reading.

998
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,639
This Plan B was made in January.

999
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,880
Why the Japanese

1000
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
bombed Nanyuan airport on July 28th

1001
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,320
and the air force is still not allowed to participate?

1002
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,039
I also heard

1003
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,599
this Plan B is a positive plan.

1004
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,880
There's also a Plan A

1005
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,119
called the negative plan.

1006
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,280
The 14th article in the Plan

1007
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,480
stipulates to continue
eliminate the "Red Bandits".

1008
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,760
But now it's deleted in Plan B.

1009
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,119
Does it mean that

1010
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:18,559
wiping out communists is no longer our priority?

1011
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,340
[Haiyu School]

1012
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,639
This song Gypsy Airs

1013
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,000
is composed by a Spanish musician,

1014
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,199
Pablo de Sarasate.

1015
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,000
It tells us

1016
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,639
as long as there is hope in their hearts,
