173
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,879
Why again?

174
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,960
They're here to bomb Jianqiao.

175
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,679
As a result, the clinic is reduced to ruins.

176
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,159
323 is blocked during liftoff

177
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,279
and nose detonation occurred.

178
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,960
Repeat.

179
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,120
Nose detonation occurred.

180
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,960
323 is on the way back.

181
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,519
Got it.

182
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
The typhoon eye has reached

183
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,000
540 nautical miles east of Shanghai,

184
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,600
with a speed of 22 meters per second.

185
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,519
Hanguang Squadron, assist the Fourth Brigade.

186
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,720
Are you OK?

187
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,440
Nurse Wang!

188
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,039
Haitang!

189
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,919
Anything wrong with you?

190
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,559
You also survive?

191
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,639
Thank you, God.

192
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,440
Luckily, it's just Jianqiao's school hospital.

193
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,519
Not many patients here.

194
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,919
I think no one is hurt.

195
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:42,879
Jap's flag!

196
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,039
Jap's plane!

197
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,919
Nine Japanese planes in total.

198
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,159
Again!

199
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,039
019, 031.

200
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:53,720
Attack on the flank.

201
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,440
095, 093. Protect us.

202
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,320
Look! Our plane!

203
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,120
Haichen, 019!

204
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,399
That's 019!

205
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,080
Great!

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,799
Hit!

207
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,639
Great! Our plane!

208
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,279
Hit!

209
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,600
Meng Haitang!

210
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,399
Where are you going?

211
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,840
Luckily, you're not bombed.

212
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,840
I didn't expect you're so strong.

213
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,519
Are you worried about him like me?

214
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,039
Haitang!

215
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,679
Haitang!

216
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,000
Haichen!

217
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,440
Meng Haitang!

218
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,440
♫ How long will it take to arrive at the destination ♫

219
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,039
Can you help me keep him safe?

220
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:58,960
Meng Haitang!

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,800
♫ A distant journey ♫

222
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,000
♫ Home under the banyan tree ♫

223
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:19,000
♫ The answer of fate flows quietly ♫

224
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,639
Explosion occurred suddenly.

225
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,519
I had no time to move you to a safe place.

226
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,879
Are Haichen and you injured?

227
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,120
No.

228
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,639
Are you OK?

229
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,840
Well.

230
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,440
I seem to have heard what you said just now.

231
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,120
What?

232
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,360
You tell this tree to bless my safe return.

233
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,240
I haven't finished my words.

234
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,720
I also want it to bless Nianqiao and Huansheng,

235
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,759
not just you.

236
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,720
Got it.

237
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,440
You know what?

238
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,919
You must be regretful.

239
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,639
I'm an ideal fiance.

240
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,399
Why did you cancel the engagement?

241
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,720
No.

242
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,799
By the way,

243
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,320
it's my father who wanted to cancel it.

244
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,639
OK, let's make a bet.

245
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,399
Swear to this begonia tree.

246
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,080
Whoever regrets the dissolution

247
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,159
of the engagement first will lose.

248
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,879
OK.

249
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,159
No, we have to pinky swear to prove it.

250
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,279
The loser must listen to the winner all the life.

251
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,200
OK.

252
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
Deal.

253
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,480
Deal.

254
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,840
We all know on August 14th,

255
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,960
we defeated the enemy with a force superior in number.

256
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,720
The problem is,

257
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,240
If we are equally matched
or even out numbered next time,

258
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,639
how to fight?

259
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,639
Any ideas?

260
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,000
Poshan, what's your idea?

261
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,759
Is there any chance to achieve
a partially outnumbered victory?

262
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,120
To achieve that,

263
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,639
We need an ace fighter,

264
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
which is superior in airspeed, turning

265
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,519
and fighting performance.

266
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,679
However, it is well known

267
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,399
that aircraft often cannot have

268
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,519
both turning and fighting performance.

269
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,639
Even if it has the two features,

270
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,000
is there anyone that is skillful enough?

271
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,039
Therefore, we have to improve the performance
of the fighter

272
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,119
and improve the flight technology.

273
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Neither is dispensable.

274
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,240
Captain.

275
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,359
It's no use telling these recruits.

276
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,079
They haven't even flown a plane.

277
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,000
According to the course of our school,

278
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,480
you need two years.

279
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,599
Make sure we still have planes two years later.

280
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,039
Can you shorten the tutorial?

281
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,400
We want to fly a plane right now!

282
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,079
Yes.

283
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,759
Shall we double our daily class hours?

284
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:28,759
Mr. Hang.

285
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,000
Special arrangements in special periods.

286
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,519
Captain.

287
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,559
Fly in this way but...

288
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,480
Zeng Poshan.

289
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,240
Captain.

290
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,160
Why not have a rest?

291
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,079
Are you still studying overtime?

292
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,960
Tell me what you've learned.

293
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,119
Mr. Zhang.

294
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,039
You told me

295
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,079
the fighters of Hanguang Squadron

296
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,559
have their own radios installed.

297
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,000
I guess your 019 has other modifications.

298
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,680
What do you think I modified?

299
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,119
Lighter weight means something has been removed.

300
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,920
Auxiliary oil tank.

301
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,279
Captain.

302
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,000
Did you remove the auxiliary fuel tank?

303
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,240
Smart.

304
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,000
But the aircraft's hang time is quite important.

305
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,640
Why am I willing to remove the auxiliary fuel tank?

306
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,440
Remove the auxiliary fuel tank to reduce weight...

307
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,000
I see.

308
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,920
The lighter the fighter,

309
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,680
the more flexible it is

310
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,640
and the easier it is to turn in the air.

311
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,640
Mr. Hang.

312
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,039
The partial outnumbered victory depends on

313
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,319
the turning and fighting performance of ace fighters.

314
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,839
To realize that,

315
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,680
you modified 019.

316
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,319
But...

317
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,559
After removing the tank...

318
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,400
Yes.

319
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,200
Speed first.

320
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,079
Leave no chance for enemy.

321
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,359
Don't leave yourself a chance.

322
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,599
Every time I take off, I have to be determined to die.

323
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,519
I don't want you to die in the sky.

324
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,000
Come on.

325
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,480
Have a rest.

326
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,119
I want to study 019 more.

327
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,440
Mr. Zhang.

328
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,119
Shall I learn from you

329
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,839
when you modify your fighter?

330
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,880
When I have my own fighter,

331
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,119
I will also transform it.

332
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,839
I also want an ace fighter.

333
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:51,799
OK.

334
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,359
You shall be my assistant.

335
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,319
Yes.

336
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,559
Here's where my father lives, Xu Village.

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,920
I've been here.

338
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,640
How?

339
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:12,519
Well.

340
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,480
Xu Yuanyin.

341
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,200
Zeng Poshan.

342
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,519
Be careful.

343
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,200
Thank you.

344
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,359
I'm fine.

345
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,519
Nianqiao.

346
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,480
Miss. Xu, you know him?

347
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,759
- Yes.
- No.

348
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,960
I met her in a bookstore days ago.

349
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,039
Captain Hang just arrived.

350
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,440
You were very brave then.

351
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,119
Come in first.

352
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,160
I'll come later.

353
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,640
Hurry up.

354
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,599
Dad wants to see you.

355
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,440
Got it.

356
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,759
Come down. I can help you.

357
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,000
Sir.

358
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,640
Sir.

359
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,000
Sir.

360
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,319
Captain.

361
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,960
My dad is not at home?

362
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,960
A war is imminent.

363
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,359
I made great effort
asking for one-day leave for Poshan.

364
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,039
Shall we wait?

365
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,559
Maybe he's coming back soon.

366
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,359
OK.

367
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:40,920
OK.

368
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:41,880
Thank you.

369
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,759
Zeng Poshan.

370
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,920
You're also one of Zeng's family.

371
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:51,880
So Mr. Zeng in the house is your father?

372
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,920
Yes.

373
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,359
Zen Nianqiao is your elder brother?

374
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,240
Yes.

375
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
Nianqiao.

376
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,839
We fought four battles in six days.

377
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,319
What do you think?

378
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,240
That must be a great victory.

379
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,599
Gao Zhihang led the Fourth Brigade

380
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,279
to fight against nine Mitsubishi AM.

381
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,359
They shoot down three and hurt one.

382
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,799
Even the Minister of Education complimented

383
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,359
that Captain Gao was the god of war.

384
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,400
Anything else?

385
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,519
Apart from god of war,

386
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,839
our squadron cooperated with the Fifth Brigade

387
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,319
to bomb the enemy destroyer in Songhua.

388
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
Captain, you dived and dropped bombs

389
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,319
at ultra-low altitude

390
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,160
and directly blew up the tail of a 1300-ton destroyer.

391
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,519
Great!

392
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:37,720
However,

393
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,720
others are less efficient.

394
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,079
Less?

395
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,480
Much less.

396
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,519
Chen Ran's 024 almost blew up the public concession.

397
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,119
But we won a battle at Jianqiao.

398
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,680
Captain Gao led the Fourth Brigade

399
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,759
to win a great battle.

400
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,359
But planes consume too much fuel.

401
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,799
After war,

402
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,440
all members must add fuel.

403
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,440
Two Japanese warplanes chased after us.

404
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,720
Luckily, Huansheng and you

405
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,960
took off in time to defend the enemy.

406
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,200
Or Jianqiao would have been attacked again.

407
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:19,279
Neither Huansheng nor I shot down an enemy plane.

408
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,440
His 031 was almost hit by the tail gun of the enemy.

409
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,160
Fool!

410
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Three pilots died in Shanghai.

411
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,440
Yu Kejing's 323 had a nose detonation
before it took off.

412
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,839
The air battle on August 14th

413
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,839
is our first victory in the air battle against Japan.

414
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,240
But we won just because

415
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,319
Japanese didn't expect we dare take off and fight.

416
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,160
The chance of victory will be lower.

417
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,839
Yes.

418
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,440
See you next time.

419
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,680
The Japanese army suffered a great loss this time.

420
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,720
It seems that there must be a hard battle in the future.

421
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,839
The Japanese raided out of the siege

422
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,160
and bombed our Jianqiao Clinic

423
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,279
because of their good aircraft performance.

424
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,279
We failed to catch them.

425
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,119
Yes.

426
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,079
Captain.

427
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,640
If you hadn't begged others

428
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,880
and quarreled with the Minister of Education

429
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,559
in order to get nine radios for us,

430
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,119
all of us should have died

431
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,799
and lost most of the planes.

432
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,200
You think my modification works, too?

433
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,880
Of course.

434
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,160
The Hawk III sold by Cox in the United States

435
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,319
follows the rule that the performance of

436
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:53,000
exported military aircraft must be poorer than

437
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,400
that of domestic equivalent models.

438
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,400
No landing hook.

439
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,680
The metal wing is changed into wooden wing,

440
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,920
quite easy to catch fire.

441
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,559
The airfoils have changed.

442
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,039
No exhaust pipe of the engine.

443
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Its performance is even poorer than Hawk II.

444
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,480
But the most irritating thing is the cancellation
of the radio.

445
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,319
So we can't form an air formation.

446
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,200
Fighting separately means blind fighting.

447
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,759
How dare they?

448
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,000
Without radio, how can we fight in the sky?

449
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,400
Radio is a piece of cake.

450
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,880
But I can't deal with other aspects.

451
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,759
The landing gear needs to be shaken manually.

452
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,799
The sighting mirror is so small that I'm pissed off.

453
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:43,920
Yes.

454
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,519
The American consultant said

455
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,880
it's OK to use that kind of mirror

456
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,359
on small weapons on the ground.

457
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,440
If it's used in air combat,

458
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,559
it will be ineffective at all.

459
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:52,559
Otherwise,

460
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,599
we should have failed to bomb the Japanese fleet
on August 14th.

461
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,680
In a word,

462
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,079
Hawks III was eliminated by the Americans.

463
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,599
But it has become our main fighter.

464
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:11,519
I heard that the Japanese are studying a new fighter.

465
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:13,440
It is said that the performance is super great.

466
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,279
Of course.

467
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,240
Captain.

468
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:19,720
We use the obsolete aircraft of America

469
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,440
to fight against the latest and best fighters of Japan.

470
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,680
It equals to throwing an egg against a rock.

471
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,200
How can they do that?

472
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,039
So we can't count on Americans.

473
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
We should rely on ourselves.

474
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,519
There is a plane factory in Jianqiao.

475
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,880
We transform and maintain our planes there.

476
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,920
But the general consultant of the factory
is an American.

477
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,640
The level of domestic mechanics is very poor.

478
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,480
No one has studied aerodynamics
or aeronautical engineering.

479
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,720
When Poshan and other pilots take off,

480
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,200
they all use broken engines,

481
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,440
broken sighting telescopes and landing gears.

482
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,799
It's difficult to take off,

483
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,119
let alone fight with death.

484
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,559
Aeronautical engineering.

485
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,279
Aerodynamics.

486
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,200
I know that!

487
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,160
Mr. Hang.

488
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,400
Even if the engine doesn't work

489
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,359
and the sighting telescope is poor,

490
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,920
we still have to take off.

491
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,960
I must fight for my dead mother.

492
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
I'm not afraid to fight with death.

493
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,519
Who dare die?

494
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,880
Fool! Idiots!

495
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,640
Poor memory!

496
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,359
I'm still alive!

497
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,559
Who dare die?

498
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,000
Is your life so valueless?

499
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,519
No.

500
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,319
What did I say?

501
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,519
You don't have a kid.

502
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,440
You have no offspring.

503
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,319
No offspring.

504
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,039
Don't consider death before you have a kid.

505
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,599
You always make me angry.

506
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,519
Have you lost your memory?

507
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,240
Don't you know who I am?

508
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,279
Although I studied theoretical physics,

509
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,480
I got a doctorate in aerodynamics in Germany.

510
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,519
I calculated the result of the three-dimensional
wing theory.

511
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,279
Don't you know?

512
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,160
No.

513
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,640
You...

514
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,660
Are you playacting early in the morning?

515
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,310
Are those words for me?

516
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:55,640
You're too young to play tricks on me.

517
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,799
Come in. Don't make a fool of yourself.

518
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,680
Come in.

519
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,720
Speak.

520
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,119
Why do you come here in the morning?

521
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,680
Don't stand like a pillar.

522
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,759
Sit down.

523
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,920
What's wrong?

524
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,119
Dad.

525
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,559
Why not try the shoes I bought for you?

526
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,960
Shut up.

527
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
What's the matter?

528
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,119
Mr. Zeng.

529
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,920
We can only practice our flying skills.

530
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,160
But when it comes to the plane itself,

531
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,519
we have to consult a real expert.

532
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,400
So this time, we sincerely want

533
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,160
to invite you to work as our general consultant

534
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,319
in the plane factory.

535
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,839
That's right.

536
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,400
Be a consultant.

537
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,240
How about the salary?

538
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,599
Well...

539
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,680
I'll ask about it.

540
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,119
OK.

541
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,799
OK.

542
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,240
I'm the right person to be the consultant.

543
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:30,799
Dad.

544
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,759
Aren't they the exercise books of Captain
and me at school?

545
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,839
Why are they here?

546
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,640
Don't touch it!

547
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,799
Don't touch it!

548
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,720
You took many notes at school

549
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,400
but threw them away when you finished.

550
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,480
I got them back.

551
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,200
They're useful.

552
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,400
He likes reading these notebooks all day long.

553
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,240
He cherishes them.

554
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,519
He took them with him all the way to escape.

555
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,799
Aren't they troublesome?

556
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,920
Listen.

557
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,759
There are many useful things.

558
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,400
Dad.

559
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,359
Haitang.

560
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,119
Qianying.

561
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,079
Lanshan.

562
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:31,680
Mom.

563
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,079
Dad is back!

564
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,079
Scholar Meng is back!

565
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,359
Dad!

566
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,599
Son!

567
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,880
Meng!

568
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,279
Meng!

569
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,160
Auntie!

570
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,400
Big cousin!

571
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,200
Zhang Qi, you're also here?

572
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,039
Why are you here?

573
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,680
And me.

574
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,279
Scholar Zeng.

575
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,119
You're too slow.

576
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,759
You walked faster than we took a trunk.

577
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,359
Yes.

578
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:57,880
Look.

579
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,240
I've put the house in order.

580
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,039
Great.

581
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,119
Now you can get those ready-made things.

582
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,599
First, I'd like to toast the three heroic pilots here.

583
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,519
You won a great battle.

584
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,880
You taught those Japs a lesson.

585
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,559
You demonstrated the prestige of Chinese.

586
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,680
Cheers.

587
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,759
Cheers.

588
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,640
Thank you, Mr. Meng. Thank you, everyone.

589
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,400
Let's start!

590
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,759
Bing Bing.

591
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:29,599
You really deserve to be the air warrior I admire.

592
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,000
You hit the Japanese hard in the first battle.

593
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,720
Well done.

594
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,960
Haitang.

595
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,079
You're quite brave.

596
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,799
You even dare to take a plane by this madman.

597
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,720
As soon as I saw the telegram,

598
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,880
I knew you came to Hangzhou with him.

599
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,079
You must have suffered a lot.

600
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,240
If he dare bully you,

601
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,839
tell me at once.

602
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,359
Cousin, you know him?

603
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,000
Cousin?

604
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
Zhang Qi, you don't know.

605
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,160
Haitang is my auntie's daughter.

606
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,440
So I'm her big cousin.

607
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,279
Give me one minute.

608
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,519
Let me formally introduce my girlfriend,

609
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:11,799
Miss. Long Zhenzhu.

610
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,000
She is good at photography.

611
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,000
She usually helps me take some news photos.

612
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,200
Zhenzhu.

613
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,759
Almost everyone in our big family is here.

614
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,839
Well.

615
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,599
Let me introduce Zeng Nianqiao.

616
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,640
He's Mr. Zeng's eldest son.

617
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,119
You like pilots.

618
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,480
Nianqiao and Zhang Qi are in the same squadron.

619
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,319
He's also a pilot.

620
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,359
Also a pilot?

621
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,240
Why are you pilots so handsome?

622
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,839
Are you recruited by appearance?

623
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,079
Zhang Qi.

624
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,880
Hong'en and I are going to interview the pilots.

625
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,160
Don't refuse us, OK?

626
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,559
Behave well in the interview.

627
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,039
Especially you, Nianqiao.

628
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,480
He is very obedient.

629
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,720
I watched him grow up when he was a child.

630
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,119
He's a good boy.

631
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:05,799
Qianying.

632
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,679
Does Nianqiao often take care of you?

633
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,960
Mr. Ling, I'm flattered.

634
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,960
I remember your childhood anecdotes.

635
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,599
When she was little,

636
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,840
she was naughty.

637
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,920
You picked her up

638
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,960
and hung her directly on the tree, didn't you?

639
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,000
Dad.

640
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,519
Dad, I was little then.

641
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,320
I'm 17 now.

642
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,360
17?

643
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,440
But you're still a kid.

644
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,920
Your nominal age is 17.

645
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,880
Master.

646
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,480
Am I 17 years old?

647
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,880
Yes.

648
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,000
She'll be 18 next year.

649
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,239
Qianying.

650
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,719
Why do you call my dad Master?

651
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,280
Secret.

652
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,559
Scholar Zeng.

653
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,039
Hey, you are crafty!

654
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,000
I made great efforts raising her up.

655
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,840
She should learn archaeology from me.

656
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,639
Why does she become your student?

657
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,400
It's her own choice.

658
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,159
But I should thank you.

659
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,400
You've taught her very well since her childhood.

660
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,679
She's quite smart.

661
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,719
Why not celebrate me?

662
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:04,880
Meng.

663
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,159
Scholar Zeng.

664
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:08,400
You've found a treasure.

665
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,519
Yes.

666
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,760
I want to ask you what plans you have in the future.

667
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,320
You are the Secretary General of Fuhua University.

668
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,400
I have to ask you what you plan to do.

669
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,800
I'm worried about it, too.

670
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,920
There is no barrier in this area.

671
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,920
The Japanese can drive straight in at any time.

672
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,800
Therefore, Changsha is not a long-term base for Fuhua.

673
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,000
Changsha.

674
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,679
Chang...

675
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,719
I heard that the central government intends

676
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,320
to move several universities west

677
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,639
to Changsha or Yunnan.

678
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,320
I think Yunnan is a good place.

679
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,679
It has high mountains.

680
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,239
It is distant, located in the southwest corner

681
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,960
and blocked by big rivers.

682
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,719
We can study there at ease.

683
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:57,280
So Yunnan is really a good choice.

684
00:35:59,039 --> 00:35:59,559
OK.

685
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,800
We've made a decision.

686
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,159
As for when and where we will depart,

687
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,760
let's listen to Meng.

688
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,440
As for when to leave,

689
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,960
I really can't decide for a while.

690
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,280
However,

691
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,719
it's a blessing that we can get together again

692
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,280
in the time of war.

693
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:28,159
I just don't know when I can return to Peiping.

694
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
This toast is to...

695
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:37,280
I hope we can drive away the invaders and
return to our hometown

696
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,719
as soon as possible.

697
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,599
See you.

698
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,440
Yuanyin, see you.

699
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,079
See you.

700
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,719
Bing Bing, see you.

701
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:50,960
See you.

702
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,719
See you.

703
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,320
You'll leave?

704
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,599
See you.

705
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,800
Wait a minute.

706
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,840
I have something for you.

707
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,920
Next time...

708
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,559
Zhang Qi.

709
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,119
Since you're back,

710
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,079
here you are.

711
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,679
Remember to tell me.

712
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,760
OK.

713
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,239
I'll come and see you sometime.

714
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,119
You should study hard.

715
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:12,719
OK.

716
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:16,480
Nianqiao.

717
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,639
Remember to ride a bike with me next time.

718
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,760
OK, I will. See you.

719
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,239
Here you are. Chapter One.

720
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:27,960
Thanks.

721
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,239
See you.

722
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:32,760
See you.

723
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,480
See you.

724
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,400
Why did you salvage these plants?

725
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,760
To feed the ducks.

726
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,400
It's raining hard.

727
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
Without you,

728
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,280
I might have been drenched.

729
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,400
Don't worry.

730
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,119
You offered me an umbrella last time.

731
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,599
I received your letter, " Sorrow of Young Werther".

732
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,679
I want to exchange my opinions with you.

733
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,800
I've been thinking about a problem for three days

734
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,519
but haven't figured it out.

735
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,639
What problem?

736
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,320
Does Lotte really love Werther?

737
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,079
What do you think?

738
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,559
I think she loves him.

739
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,719
Do you remember the part
that they read Rite of Spring?

740
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,199
Yes.

741
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,440
Here.

742
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,960
Look.

743
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,519
Lotte propped herself on the windowsill

744
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,280
with her elbow and stared out of the window at the field.

745
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
She looked at the sky and at me.

746
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,079
I saw her eyes filled with tears.

747
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,000
Lotte cried when she saw Werther.

748
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,239
Doesn't she love him?

749
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,000
Did she feel pain in her heart

750
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,639
because she fell in love with him,

751
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,519
or did she know she fell in love with him

752
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,119
because she felt pain in her heart?

753
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,440
If I were Lotte,

754
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,000
I would have died after the death of Werther.

755
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,840
He gave me everything of him.

756
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:10,760
The only thing I can give him is my life.

757
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:20,800
Meng.

758
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,920
I've been thinking about something.

759
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,119
Hangzhou is bombed every two days.

760
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,559
It's so close to Shanghai and it's an air force base.

761
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,679
If a war breaks out there,

762
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,920
we won't be at peace.

763
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,119
Shall we leave Hangzhou

764
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,719
and find a peaceful place to stay?

765
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:40,920
What do you think?

766
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,280
What's your idea?

767
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,000
I...

768
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,679
I don't want to go.

769
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,199
Zhang Qi just paid the tuition fees this month
and arranged the lessons.

770
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,400
Why not return the tuition?

771
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:00,239
I promised to teach them until the end
of the vacation.

772
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,559
As a teacher,

773
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
I can't break my promise.

774
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:03,880
Yes.

775
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,559
As a teacher,

776
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,320
you must keep the promise.

777
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,360
Though you just teach some kids,

778
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,719
you must work hard.

779
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,559
Don't let me down.

780
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,079
One more thing.

781
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,880
After I finish the teaching course at Haiyu School,

782
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,000
I'll continue studying history instead of
teacher-training.
