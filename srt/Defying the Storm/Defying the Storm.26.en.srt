[Defying the Storm]

2
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,350
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,439
In 1928,

4
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,879
you increased the military cost

5
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,239
due to conscription.

6
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,079
You took a lot benefits from that.

7
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,599
I'm not a student of Fuhua University.

8
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,760
Today I should take the blame.

9
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,000
If you want to punish,

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,719
then punish me.

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,150
Why do you hate me so much?

12
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,560
Why did you spread the rumor?

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,959
I wandered to Yunnan.

14
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,760
Actually I have no grudge against you.

15
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,479
But I've heard that

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,599
you manipulates hospitals,

17
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,400
and you're a loan shark.

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,520
Everyone becomes so worried.

19
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,159
And...

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,560
you allowed those who didn't take exams

21
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,919
to go into university and have class with Haitang.

22
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
Isn't it a crime?

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,240
What you said just now,

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,280
did you see that yourself?

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,199
Or did you get evidence yourself?

26
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,759
I...

27
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,439
Not yet.

28
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,960
Man,

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,719
you are really brave.

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,750
But, it's not enough only to be brave.

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,319
You'll be easily taken advantage of.

32
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,439
Of course.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,590
And I'm not an arbitrary man.

34
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,879
The Democracy Wall of your university

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,919
is my idea, right?

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,680
Today you came to my house to fight against me.

37
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,879
But I invited you to join my dinner, right?

38
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,599
The teacher training course is my suggestion.

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,439
But that's to improve education level of local teachers.

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,919
Supervisor Bai is right.

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
Those who accepted lessons in Normal College

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
are the teachers in the future.

43
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,879
They need practice.

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,759
Supervisor Bai also said that

45
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,520
Fuhua has the right
to decide teacher training courses.

46
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
Then students suggested to

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,150
establish the intermediary
teacher training course in Fuhua

48
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,910
and that students of Normal College work as teachers.

49
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,759
And even,

50
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,360
establish the primary course

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,439
for the basic education,

52
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,120
also establish the quality education course
of democracy and civilization,

53
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,910
which can help spread culture,

54
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,080
and also can apply what we've learned
into the practice.

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,120
If it's admitted,

56
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,280
I'm glad to be the first one

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,479
to be a teacher of primary course.

58
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,080
And also welcome Supervisor Bai
who supports democracy

59
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,680
and fights against White Terror

60
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,840
to come and join us.

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,240
Supervisor.

62
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,919
If you do support democracy,

63
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,759
why don't you join us to learn?

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,560
Listen to the people.

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,800
Dad,

66
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,600
look at this,

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,639
it's delicious and nutritious.

68
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,279
Then do you think that

69
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,190
those who eat it are not barbarians?

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,040
Look at that girl.

71
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,879
Delicious.

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,199
Fuhua is called the Holy Land of Democracy.

73
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,800
Part of Democracy

74
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,480
is to protect others' rights and reputation.

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,279
So I suggest you that

76
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,240
when you hold the event of
Wall of Democracy every time,

77
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,879
you should remember that word Democracy.

78
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,360
That's also what I fight for.

79
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,199
And it's also the reason why

80
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,040
I welcome Fuhua University to Kunming,

81
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,680
improving the education level of Yunnan.

82
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,240
Professor Meng.

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,279
Would you offer an opportunity for
the students of teacher training course

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,720
to accomplish their study?

85
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,040
If they pass all exams of this semester year,

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
[Report of Compensation]

87
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,879
then include six persons

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,240
into formal students of Fuhua.

89
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,839
I'll talk to Ministry of Education,

90
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,319
let them offer financial help

91
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,399
to support Fuhua University.

92
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,120
Yes, Supervisor Bai.

93
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,390
If one of six persons can't pass the exams,

94
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,240
I'll cancel the teacher training course,

95
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,000
changing it to the mid-level course.

96
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,079
Deal.

97
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,040
Thanks for your understanding

98
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,040
and your support to Fuhua.

[Report of Compensation]

100
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,519
Great.

101
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,800
President Zhang and
Secretary General Meng, please.

102
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,279
Please.

103
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,600
President Zhang

104
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,199
It's really urgent that we need medicine

105
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,310
of malaria, pneumonia, plague

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,839
for the Yunnan-Burma Highway.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Please.

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,560
Don't worry, Supervisor Bai.

109
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,240
I'll go back to Singapore to prepare.

110
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,480
The medicine will soon be ready for shipment.

111
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,399
Dad, I would like to go to hospital.

112
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
Haichen said the surgery of Zhang Qi is good,

113
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,399
but he's still in danger.

114
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,720
It's too late.

115
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,920
I'll go back to school with students first,

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,360
and go to hospital with you.

117
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,160
It's fine, I can go myself.

118
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,120
No.

119
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,279
Mr. Meng.

120
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,630
You can go back to school with students,

121
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Haitang can take a ride with me.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,879
That's great.

123
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,040
Thanks.

124
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,399
See you.

125
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,360
Let's go.

126
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,079
Supervisor Bai.

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,839
Say goodbye to Supervisor Bai.

128
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,839
Goodbye.

129
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,200
Father, you can have a rest.

130
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,360
Captain stops bleeding now.

131
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
He is better now.

132
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,120
He won't die.

133
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
But I won't stop criticizing him.

134
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,600
Father.

135
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
About Poshan,

136
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,600
that's not his fault.

137
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,120
I never blamed him.

138
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,000
I helped him put up the recruitment notice.

139
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,480
I helped him fix West Mountain Flight.

140
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,919
Poshan is...

141
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,559
Forget it.

142
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,720
Father, sorry.

143
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,759
I should be blamed for that.

144
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,759
I didn't take good care of him.

145
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,240
You can blame me.

146
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,679
But don't keep it only in your own mind.

147
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,559
I'm worried about you.

148
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,840
I...that makes me feel sad.

149
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,399
Fine, enough.

150
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,639
OK.

151
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,879
OK, stop talking about it.

152
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,240
Well, father.

153
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,159
I have something to ask you.

154
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,159
What?

155
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,399
I want to ask

156
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,360
why Qin is carved on Poshan's tombstone?

157
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,159
It's time to tell you.

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,360
Or we may not have a chance later.

159
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,519
When I was young,

160
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,440
I was just like you,

161
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,799
my parents died.

162
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,960
I was a poor kid.

163
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,399
I became a beggar in my hometown, Hailun City.

164
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,879
It was Zeng Family who

165
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,360
helped me and let me stay there.

166
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:59,960
Zeng Family was a respected family in Hailun City.

167
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,679
They had only one son.

168
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,519
Master Zeng asked me

169
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,559
to be his son's companion.

170
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,799
In 1910,

171
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,790
Master Zeng would like Young Master to

172
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,519
go to Peiping to

173
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,519
attend Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program.

174
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,919
He asked me and Young Master's fiancee

175
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,270
to go with Young Master.

176
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,150
We three went to Peiping together.

177
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,159
It happened all of a sudden,

178
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,840
when we arrived in Peiping,

179
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,919
Young Master got sick.

180
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,240
Before we could attend the exam,

181
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,679
Young Master died of disease.

182
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,720
We had no choice.

183
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,480
We went back to hometown to tell the family.

184
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,080
The whole family of Zeng was

185
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,279
in great sorrow.

186
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,960
But later,

187
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,799
I didn't know why

188
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,120
Zeng Family came up with an idea,

189
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,039
that they adopted me as their son,

190
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,790
and asked me to marry Young Master's fiancee.

191
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,879
The next year I went to the capital

192
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,360
to attend the exam

193
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,279
under the name of Zeng Mu.

194
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,519
Unexpectedly, I passed the exam.

195
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,279
So your family name is Qin,

196
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,919
not Zeng.

197
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,480
But also coincidentally,

198
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,279
I have the same name as Young Master.

199
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,159
His name is Zeng Mu.

200
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,840
My name is Qin Mu.

201
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,639
However, when I passed the exam,

202
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,390
I became that Zeng Mu.

203
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,720
I went to the United States,

204
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,639
later went to German,

205
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,550
studying theoretical physics
and aerodynamics.

206
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,759
And in that way

207
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,600
I transformed myself

208
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,390
from a poor adopted boy

209
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,080
into a doctor.

210
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,480
And also I got married and had a kid in Zeng Family.

211
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:06,919
Zeng Family,

212
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,080
treated this Zeng Mu well.

213
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,679
But the better they treated me,

214
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,360
I felt more guilty.

215
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,679
Because I am not the real Zeng Mu.

216
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,440
I am a fake one.

217
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,320
A man who forgets his ancestor.

218
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,919
I... Well...

219
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,120
I became a rootless duckweed.

220
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,480
What a shame.

221
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,240
What a shame.

222
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,480
Father.

223
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,159
Don't think like that.

224
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,240
Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program,
it's you passed the exam.

225
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,480
Two doctor degrees,

226
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,679
you got them with your ability.

227
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,960
You have been a teacher for 20 years,

228
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,200
with students around the world.

229
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,799
You achieved that

230
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,080
because of your hard work.

231
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,759
No, that's different.

232
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,519
When I got married at first,

233
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,240
I felt awkward.

234
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,000
She was Young Master's fiancee.

235
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,159
Later she told me that

236
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,240
she liked me,

237
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,159
not Young Master.

238
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,600
Later,

239
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,240
Poshan was born.

240
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,879
That year, she came to Peiping,

241
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,759
we went to West Mountain to see sunset.

242
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,960
She was so happy.

243
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,910
I hadn't see that she smiled so prettily before.

244
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,960
She said it would be better

245
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,480
if she could have a picture.

246
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,919
But I could not shoot at that time.

247
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,240
Finally it became a pity of life time.

248
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,550
That's why you always punish us to go to

249
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,759
West Mountain to shoot sunset.

250
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,159
That's the reason.

251
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,840
Yeah, kind of.

252
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,910
I really feel sorry for her.

253
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,840
After we married, we spent more time
apart than together.

254
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,759
Except sending the money,

255
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,360
there were only two or three times that

256
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,919
I went back to hometown.

257
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,879
I felt shamed.

258
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,559
When I went back to hometown,

259
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,799
I was in a dilemma.

260
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,120
Neither fish nor fowl.

261
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,440
Neither fish nor fowl.

262
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,440
Father.

263
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,039
No matter which one is your family name,
Zeng or Qin,

264
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,399
in my mind,

265
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,750
you're just my dad who
carried me on shoulders

266
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,840
when I was young.

267
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,320
My son.

268
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,399
Now your family name is also Zeng,

269
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,799
won't you blame me?

270
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,440
Why do I blame you?

271
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,559
I'm your son.

272
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,480
That's good.

273
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,550
Not only those related by blood
are close relatives.

274
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,000
From today,

275
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
please take me as your son.

276
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,720
Thank you.

277
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,840
Father, I'll see you off.

278
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,919
I'm OK, that's fine.

279
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,759
I can go back myself.

280
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,960
How about captain?

281
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
How about captain?

282
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,000
How about his surgery?

283
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,039
It's good.

284
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,080
Have a look.

285
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,799
Miss, how can I help you?

286
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,319
Yu, go to buy one hen for me.

287
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,240
No.

288
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,110
Buy five hens.

289
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,400
Yes.

290
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,400
Why do you buy so many hens?

291
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,799
Zhenzhu.

292
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,440
I won't interfere with your social life.

293
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,160
You're honest and loyal.

294
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,519
You want to protect your friends.

295
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,240
I can understand.

296
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,160
But I'm worried that

297
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,200
you're taken advantage by others,

298
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,799
going astray.

299
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,759
What do you mean?

300
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,160
Did you go through

301
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,960
the files in my drawer just now?

302
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,079
Yes, I did.

303
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,319
I went through files in your drawer.

304
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,200
I have one question.

305
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,720
That one who is called Lu Ziyi,

306
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,830
did you get close to him recently?

307
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,960
I heard that he is really vicious and greedy.

308
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,070
Maybe he has secret connections with the Japanese.

309
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,200
You are Supervisor Bai.

310
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,799
Don't fall into his trap,

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,519
misleading the country and people,

312
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,200
then you can't go back.

313
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,759
Of course I know clearly

314
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,200
who Lu Ziyi is.

315
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,799
No need to teach me.

316
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,480
Answer me,

317
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,350
what did you do during these years?

318
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,039
Supervisor Bai, don't need your lessons.

319
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,599
Don't fool me.

320
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,680
You've been leaving home for so many years,

321
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,110
if I didn't protect you,

322
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,079
do you think you could run everything smoothly?

323
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,480
Be a good girl.

324
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,079
You are my only daughter,

325
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,759
I won't let you get hurt,

326
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,599
do you understand?

327
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,830
Chongqing Government won't allow Yunnan

328
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,640
to be out of control of Central Committee.

329
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,559
The communist party,

330
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,359
and the local authority,

331
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,880
both of them are great enemies of Mr. Chiang.

332
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,200
The one who contributes a lot easily gets killed.

333
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,279
This saying may also work for you.

334
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,519
Dad.

335
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,640
I know you are not that stubborn.

336
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,279
You've allowed Fuhua University

337
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,240
to operate in Yunnan.

338
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,160
And you support their academic studies

339
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,240
and their fight for democracy.

340
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,720
So you've earned the respect from those scholars.

341
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,319
And listen,

342
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,160
they'll bring more chances to us.

343
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,400
This afternoon,

344
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,880
you and Mr. Meng talked about Democracy Wall.

345
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,519
Do you just want to leave the wall there for nothing?

346
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,519
Fight against Japanese aggression
and for democracy.

347
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,880
If you can make what I said

348
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,599
come true in Yunnan,

349
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,000
more and more supporters will come to you.

350
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,359
Zhenzhu.

351
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,720
I will think about

352
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,400
what you've just said.

353
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,759
But you should promise me,

354
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,759
don't make me worried about you from now on.

355
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,519
And one more thing.

356
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,110
I've read the materials in your drawer.

357
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,640
Most fuel of Wujiaba Airport,

358
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,240
as I heard,

359
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,559
it's imported from Myanmar.

360
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,240
I've stopped the importation of fuel from Myanmar.

361
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,160
The procedure is way too out of order.

362
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,079
I gathered all these tax return documents

363
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,000
to figure out  if there are some tricks.

364
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,119
Aviation Council...

365
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,920
is always full of conspiracies.

366
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,279
Don't get yourself involved in this.

367
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:58,960
Haitang.

368
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,039
Take a seat.

369
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
I have something to say.

370
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,799
Please.

371
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,799
I've just asked the doctor.

372
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,400
Qi's surgery went well.

373
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,440
So one or two days later,

374
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,599
after the anesthetic loses effect,

375
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,960
he will wake up.

376
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:25,799
Later,

377
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,160
people from his Aviation School

378
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,960
come to take care of him.

379
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,279
Don't worry.

380
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,920
I will stay here

381
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,720
to take care of him.

382
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,039
Your whole family is well educated.

383
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,559
So you must be very

384
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,240
reasonable and really nice,

385
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,799
as well as elegant.

386
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,200
So...

387
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
when you and Qi were kids,

388
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,480
your father and I had

389
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,200
had you two engaged as a promise.

390
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,559
But I know,

391
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,240
now you're the so-called new youth.

392
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,720
So you're strongly against

393
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,279
that parents make the decision of

394
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,720
whom you get married to.

395
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,480
But during this period,

396
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,480
when I saw you and Zhang Qi

397
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:13,400
now stay together and love each other so deeply.

398
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,559
You care for each other.

399
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,920
I feel so happy for that.

400
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:19,839
Haitang.

401
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,759
Qi has suffered a lot.

402
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,519
When he was a kid, he lost his mom.

403
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,559
I didn't do a good job as his father.

404
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,880
Haitang.

405
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,759
Now,

406
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,160
all he needs is you.

407
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,079
Actually it's me that who need him most.

408
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,079
But please don't worry.

409
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,759
I will take care of him.

410
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
He will recover from it.

411
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:44,960
That's good.

412
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,200
Now our nation is in great danger,

413
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,640
a lot of things have to be done.

414
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,559
I have to prepare some goods for people,

415
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,640
and I can't stay here longer.

416
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,079
So,

417
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,480
when night is over,

418
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,279
I have to go back.

419
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,839
I'm afraid

420
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,880
I can't wait here until Qi wakes up.

421
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,400
So please do me a favor.

422
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,920
Here's a letter.

423
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,839
Please give it to him when he wakes up.

424
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,830
[To my son]

425
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Since we've talked in Kunming,

426
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,640
I know you have the ambition to serve the nation.

427
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,119
I feel proud but also worried.

428
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,839
I have had the same ambition.

429
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,720
If someday your wish comes true,

430
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,880
I won't be anxious for you anymore.

431
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,359
Eat well to recover soon.

432
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,319
To be strong to live through all this.

433
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,319
I will take care of your grandfather.

434
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,319
Don't have us on your mind.

435
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,759
Fight your war in the sky,

436
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,880
and kill all our enemies.

437
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,359
The soup smells so good.

438
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,640
You did a better job than me.

439
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,839
Haitang.

440
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,640
Auntie, look.

441
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,160
Try this. Good, isn't it?

442
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,200
You're good at it.

443
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,480
Simmer for a few more minutes.

444
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,559
I got one more hen.

445
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,680
On 27th July,

446
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,759
the Japanese army took off from Yuncheng Airport,

447
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,400
and Hankou Airport.

448
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,240
108 planes have launched air attack

449
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,559
towards Chengdu.

450
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,240
575 citizens have died from it.

451
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,640
As it is recorded,

452
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,119
we have lost more than 85 percent

453
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,119
of national air force.

454
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,640
You must be tired.

455

Rebound. Rebound. Rebound.

456
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,119
Nice shot. Good one.

and do some field researches.

466

What about you?

467
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,240
Though it's rainy season now,

468

today is good for practice.

469

We'll camp in village today.

470

Really?

471

I haven't thanked you before.

477
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,799
You found New England Medical Magazine.

478

Thanks for helping me for such a long time.

479
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,680
I don't like people saying thanks.

480
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,279
It's alright.

481
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,240
You found him the way to get cured.

482
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,720
It means you saved his life.

483
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,559
He should thank you.

484

Now you guys are here, join us to play basketball.

00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:49,960
We'd find a shelter.

510
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,680
Hurry up.

511
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,799
It's nothing. Carry on.

512
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,279
It gets heavier.

513
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,480
Take a break.

514
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,359
Zhang Qi.

515
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,200
Are you alright? It's raining heavily.

516
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,079
I'm good.

517

Nianqiao.

518
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,559
I'm good.

519
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,119
Stay where you are, don't get soaked.

520
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
Brothers,

521
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,359
we won't leave the field even if it's a storm.

522
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,359
Of course.

523
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,960
Come on. Go.

524
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,279

Thank you.

560
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,960
Do you see Lieutenant Li's look?

561
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:34,759
Lieutenant Li.

562
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,720
Why are you still here?

563
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,920
I don't like you call me Lieutenant.

564
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Call me Xinye.

565
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,799
Actually,

566
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,880
today I came here to ask you

567
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,759
about what I said last time,

568
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,359
and how you think about it.

569
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,799
To be honest, I've made up my mind.

570
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,640
To fly transport aircraft

571
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,839
or work as an operational officer is not good for me.

572
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,559
I used to be a combatant.

573
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,440
Now I'm a deputy captain.

574
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,440
I was born to be the one

575
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,599
who flies above the battlefield.

576
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,519
I'm ready to do

577
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,000
what my brother Poshan has done.

578
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,440
Lieutenant Li. It's late now.

579
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,719
You have to leave here.

580
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,800
I see the way you look at Li.

581
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,920
I can feel it.

582
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,960
Lieutenant Li loves Nianqiao.

583
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:46,880
And me...

584
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,119
It's enough to stay by her side.

585
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,360
Mr. Chen Dairong once said,

586
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,679
to love someone

587
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,000
is only known to the one who loves.

588
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,840
It has nothing to do with the one who is loved.

589
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,039
It's lucky enough to have someone to love.

590
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:04,199
What Mr. Chen Dairong said is Platonic romance.

591
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,239
I've seen Mr. Chen

592
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,639
send flowers to Ms. Kang for years.

593
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,559
He's been lucky for half of his life.

594
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,559
But I think,

595
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,639
the way Nianqiao looks at Lieutenant Li

596
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,719
is different from how my brother looks at Haitang.

597
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,000
My parents are now in Kunming.

598
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,920
I want to invite you

599
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,719
to join us for dinner.

600
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,159
Lieutenant Li. You know,

601
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
we've been so busy training here,

602
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,199
so I'm sorry I can't go.

603
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,480
And...

604
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,320
the feather gloves you gave to me

605
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,639
are too small.

606
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,440
It's not my size.

607
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,559
I'll return them to you later.

608
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,119
I have to go now.

609
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,800
Do you need a ride?

610
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,280
No, I'm good.

611
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,639
Lieutenant Li.

612
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,159
I have something to tell you.

613
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,199
What is it?

614
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,440
I...

615
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,599
Since I saw you at Nanyuan Airport,

616
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:53,199
I just...

617
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,880
I know you love Nianqiao.

618
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,519
I don't mean to...

619
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,000
He just has turned me down.

620
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,840
I, I don't mean to

621
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,679
steal this chance.

622
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,559
Steal a chance?

623
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,559
Little brother, how old are you?

624
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm 21.

625
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,559
So do you know

626
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,840
I'm five years older than you?

627
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,840
I know I'm younger.

628
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,000
But it doesn't matter.

629
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,920
And I know you love Nianqiao.

630
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
But I will try my best to be a man who is mature

631
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,599
and strong enough to protect you.

632
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,960
Do I look like that I need your protection?

633
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
No matter how strong you seem to be,

634
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,559
but you are a woman to me.

635
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,440
Little brother.

636
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,239
Meng Haichen.

637
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,199
Yes.

638
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,840
You'll fall in love with someone

639
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,639
who deserves you more.

640
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,920
No.

641
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,960
Lieutenant Li. Please wait for a while.

642
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,840
Till I am mature and strong enough to protect you,

643
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,519
then I can fly and serve my duty alone.

644
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,639
Lieutenant Li.

645
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,320
They look so happy.

646
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,079
I'm happy, too.

647
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,559
For what?

648
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:42,880
What is it?

649
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:44,880
This is the code I created

650
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,960
when I was in the Military School in America.

651
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,039
I call it Qiming Code.

652
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,880
Qiming Code?

653
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,559
The code I've just made is

654
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
I love you forever.

655
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:09,960
Thank you.

656
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,280
Thank me?

657
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,280
Thank you for keeping me in your heart.

658
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,840
I know you wanted to marry me

659
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,119
because you don't think you can fly

660
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,039
due to your injuries.

661
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,440
But after your surgery

662
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,599
and now you get recovered,

663
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,320
you still want to fly to fight against enemies.

664
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,960
Right?

665
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,960
I...

666
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,119
I know it.

667
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,880
You've given your body,

668
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,360
even your heart to the country,

669
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,880
and what remains is left to me.

670
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,320
I won't complain.

671
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,440
I mean it.

672
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,840
I love the way you are.

673
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,199
I know

674
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,119
it's hard for you to settle down for two of us

675
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:58,519
before the Japanese army is kicked out of our land.

676
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,320
So listen,

677
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,559
go to fly and fight.

678
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,920
I'll be here and wait for you.

679
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,039
Like what Mr Ling has told me,

680
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,280
the lost territory is recovered as fog disappears,

681
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,199
the great happiness follows wherever to go.

682
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,239
Then we can get married.

683
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,400
What if we have to wait for a long time?

684
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,440
I don't care.

685
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,719
I will follow you every where.

686
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,039
I will marry no one but you.

687
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,440
Sure.

688
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,280
So no matter how long it will take,

689
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,480
even though I'm so old
that I can only stagger with a crutch,

690
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,079
I will get married with you.

691
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,239
Let's get engaged.

692
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,360
Tonight.

693
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,679
It happens so suddenly,
but we haven't prepared a token for it.

694
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,599
We have one.

695
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,280
Look there.

696
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,280
That is Pegasus.

697
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:11,719
There are its Alpha, Beta, and Gamma.

698
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,519
With the Alpha of Andromeda next to it,

699
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,440
do they look like a diamond?

700
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:36,300
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

701
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:44,200
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

702
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:51,650
♫ Shed tears to our sweet love ♫

703
00:41:52,030 --> 00:42:00,130
♫ The date of return is yet to come ♫

704
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,300
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

705
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,130
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

706
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:15,130
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

707
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:22,380
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

708
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,180
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

709
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,330
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

710
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:48,030
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫

711
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,280
♫ The faith and zeal in heart ♫

712
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,800
♫ Life and death hanging by a thread ♫

713
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:18,100
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

714
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:25,130
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

715
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:32,950
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

716
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:39,300
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

717
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:52,200
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫
