[Episode 03]

4
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,120
Mom.

5
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:40,959
Don't move.

6
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,799
What happened to me?

7
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,040
You are so naughty.

8
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,560
I know you often climb over walls.

9
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,000
Why going up so high in the sky this time?

10
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,519
Zhang Qi is so careless.

11
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,000
How could he get you on the plane?

12
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,719
Luckily, nothing happened.

13
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,040
But you suffer from sunstroke.

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,920
You have to stay in hospital for two hours.

15
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,879
It's my opinion to take the plane.

16
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,719
Don't blame him.

17
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,760
Drink some water.

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,719
What's wrong?

19
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,400
Where's my dad?

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
Isn't he angry?

21
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,680
How could that be possible?

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,639
He's so mad.

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,719
Why?

24
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,599
Isn't it obvious?

25
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,080
With so many reporters present,

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
Zhang Qi held you all the way.

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,599
Little madam,

28
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,120
do you know that you're still not married?

29
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,199
I won't listen.

30
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,439
Meng Haitang,

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,319
lie down.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,560
Cover the quilt.

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,280
Lie down.

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,280
How could a girl behave like that?

35
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,719
You must explain to me.

36
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,639
What's going on?

37
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,000
[Fuxing was in distress during its test flight.
The pilot saved his fiancee bravely.]

38
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,159
Oh my god.

39
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,960
Now the whole city could know it.

40
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,800
That...

41
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,680
Why don't you take this opportunity

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
to get married?

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,879
Impossible!

44
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,439
Why are you two on the same page this time?

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,919
Your daughter is still unmarried.

46
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,000
Since dad said no,

47
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,759
it doesn't work.

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
Absolutely impossible.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Being a pilot is too dangerous.

50
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,080
Before a war starts,

51
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,439
the plane will crash first.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,319
Your daughter is a wilful person.

53
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,280
Zhang Qi also seems like

54
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,520
a guy who cannot follow others' advice.

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,199
They can't have a happy marriage in the future.

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,759
I'll talk to Buchun to cancel the marriage.

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,520
If my daughter can't get married,

58
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,560
I'll protect her forever.

59
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,479
Dad, how nice of you.

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,400
I can eat and work.

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,159
I can support you.

62
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,759
Sit down. Lie down.

63
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,039
Don't jump. Don't jump.

64
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,759
Please lie down.

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,639
You always say that I spoil her.

66
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,960
It turns out that you're the one who spoils her.

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,240
And what's that?

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,479
You'd better explain it.

69
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,160
Meng Haitang,

70
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,399
you have to reflect on yourself.

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
That's my declaration of freedom
written on oracle bones.

72
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,560
More than 3,000 years ago,

73
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,000
Zi, the queen of King Wuding

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,879
became China's first female general.

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,439
But I can't choose my major

76
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,319
or become a historian.

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,920
Shut up.

78
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,800
I don't have time to listen to your nonsense.

79
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,839
There's still a lot of work at school.

80
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,639
You'd better lie down here

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,759
and reflect on yourself.

82
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,639
Keep an eye on her.

83
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,240
Now you can't get married.

84
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,600
Are you happy?

85
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,040
Whose handkerchief is this?

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,519
It's mine.

87
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,079
I don't think it's yours.

88
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,720
It's mine.

89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,519
You must forget about it.

90
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,510
[Dormitory]

91
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,079
Sir.

92
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,480
Mr. Zeng.

93
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,079
While attending my class,

94
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,240
you have to pay attention and think hard.

95
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,240
How dare you.

96
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,839
You dare to be distracted in my class.

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
You want to be blamed?

98
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,639
Let's learn a new equation today.

99
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,920
Zhang Qi,

100
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,120
since you think you know a lot,

101
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
come here to finish it.

102
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,519
Come here.

103
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,720
Or I'll punish you to shoot the Western Mountain.

104
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,240
Zhang Qi finished.

105
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,120
You do know a lot.

106
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,480
Right.

107
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,680
Now it's beyond my capacity to teach you.

108
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,480
Students,

109
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,079
congratulations to Zhang Qi.

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,720
I have written to Cambridge University

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,680
to offer him a place under my tutor Rutherford.

112
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,040
Proud of yourself?

113
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,800
I won't go.

114
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,439
Poshan, let's go.

115
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,040
No.

116
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Be a good boy, Poshan. Let's go.

117
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,519
I won't meet him.

118
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:22,959
Go.

119
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:23,959
Go, Poshan.

120
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,480
Father.

121
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Leave me alone.

122
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,279
Poshan, let's go.

123
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,040
No.

124
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,639
Poshan.

125
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,680
Don't shout. Don't shout.

126
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,199
I asked you to pick up my wife.

127
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,519
Why did it take you so long?

128
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,360
Come here, Poshan.

129
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,040
What happened?

130
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,199
Why are you wearing this?

131
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,319
What happened?

132
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,120
What happened?

133
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,600
What happened to you?

134
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,000
Where's my wife?

135
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,920
Father,

136
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,240
When I arrived at Hailun City,

137
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,000
Japanese planes began bombing.

138
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,959
When we found the house of the Zeng family,
it had collapsed.

139
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
How about people there?

140
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,519
People...

141
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,120
All of them...

142
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,079
My mom,

143
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,279
my grandpa and grandma died.

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,839
If my brother hadn't scratched me out of the dirt,

145
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,920
I'd be dead, too.

146
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,559
You're the only one

147
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,399
who never goes home.

148
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,840
You're not hurt at all.

149
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,200
Now you are happy?

150
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,679
Poshan.

151
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,799
My mom died.

152
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,519
Poshan.

153
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:48,960
Mr. Zeng.

154
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,320
Captain, what's wrong?

155
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,559
Having a dream?

156
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,159
I dreamed of my teacher.

157
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,399
Here.

158
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,440
Wipe the sweat.

159
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:13,840
Huansheng,

160
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,279
I have to go into town again.

161
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,159
The test flight is a success.

162
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,879
But Mr. Meng hasn't approved of
the recruitment in Fuhua University.

163
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,360
You mean...

164
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,759
I don't know if Mr. Zeng...

165
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,480
Ling,

166
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,440
this seal is pretty special.

167
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,159
What?

168
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
It's a seal of your name.

169
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,919
Yes.

170
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,399
Professor Jin once promised

171
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,759
to engrave a seal
for my calligraphy and painting collections.

172
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,360
Maybe he has done it but

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
hasn't given it to me yet.

174
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,080
That's odd.

175
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,840
The name seal should be
a cooperation of two parties,

176
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,639
one engraved with the surname
and the other with the name.

177
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,360
But I could only find this one.

178
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,960
Where did you find it?

179
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
There.

180
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,279
This book is pretty odd.

181
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,759
Look.

182
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,840
All those are economic and political treatise.

183
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,919
How could a book called Pigeon Breeding be here?

184
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,279
Right.

185
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,159
Look! There's a crease here.

186
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,159
Pigeons often feed on

187
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,279
wheat, buckwheat,

188
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,799
sorghum, corn, mung beans, peas, etc.

189
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,440
At least two kinds are needed to feed pigeons.

190
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,559
Wait a moment.

191
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,600
It suddenly comes to me that

192
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,320
Professor Jin often said that

193
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,320
pigeons could always find their way home

194
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,440
no matter how far away they are.

195
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,080
Pigeons!

196
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,679
Look.

197
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,200
Before leaving,

198
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,519
Zhilie added food to this jar.

199
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,639
Here.

200
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,480
That's it.

201
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,639
Look.

202
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,840
What?

203
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,080
I want to see if it's ready.

204
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,000
You're so greedy.

205
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,200
I heard from Poshan that

206
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,960
you made a big splash today.

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
And you went into hospital.

208
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,240
Is everything OK?

209
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,159
Sure.

210
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Look at me.

211
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,399
I'm glowing.

212
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,200
As lovely as flowers.

213
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,679
I think you're crazy.

214
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,080
So crazy.

215
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,600
Listen to me.

216
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
You'd better stay away from those pilots.

217
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,759
As far as possible.

218
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,200
When I almost got into trouble on the plane today,

219
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,799
my last wish is to eat the steamed buns

220
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,720
made by you again.

221
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,679
Amazing!

222
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,639
Now my dream will come true.

223
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,639
Don't forget us.

224
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,039
Everyone, let's replace alcohol with tea

225
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,720
to celebrate my sister's safe landing and survival.

226
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,720
Can't you say something nice?

227
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm telling the truth.

228
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,919
You really scared me to death today.

229
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,799
They feel the same. Right?

230
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,600
Yes.

231
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
My heart is still pumping now.

232
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,279
Luckily Captain Zhang is experienced.

233
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,159
I wish I could be as good as him.

234
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,039
Poshan, don't be in a daze.

235
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,279
The reason behind Uncle Zeng's steamed buns

236
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,960
for us is to make you happy.

237
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,799
I don't like the food he cooks.

238
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
That makes me sad.

239
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
Sad?

240
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,519
You have been in Peiping for nearly six years.

241
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,240
Uncle Zeng loves you so much.

242
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,919
Don't be so sulky.

243
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,120
I agree.

244
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,679
Come on. Let's play a game.

245
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,039
What game?

246
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,519
Tear the veins of leaves.

247
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,600
The loser has to answer a question.

248
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,960
Don't tell lies.

249
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,840
OK.

250
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,399
OK.

251
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,559
Three,

252
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,080
two,

253
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,240
one.

254
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,360
Poshan is the loser.

255
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,480
Ask the question.

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,759
Poshan,

257
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,840
what kind of girl do you want to marry?

258
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,679
Answer it.

259
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,799
A girl like my mom.

260
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,240
Your mom?

261
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,600
What's your mom like?

262
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,879
That's the second question.

263
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,080
Fine.

264
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,399
The winner could continue.

265
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,679
Qianying, it's your turn.

266
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,159
I'll ask the same question.

267
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,600
Qianying,

268
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,279
when you grow up,

269
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,679
what kind of guy do you want to marry?

270
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,480
A guy like Nianqiao.

271
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,159
So embarrassed.

272
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,159
You've been clinging to him from childhood.

273
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,320
Now you feel the same.

274
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:57,919
If you want to be with my brother,

275
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,639
you need my permission.

276
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,440
And you, Meng Haitang?

277
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,480
It's your turn.

278
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,559
I'm not the loser.

279
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,320
Why should I tell you?

280
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,919
Haitang,

281
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,519
we all answered the question except you.

282
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,360
Don't spoil the fun.

283
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,200
Right.

284
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,039
Answer it.

285
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,679
I won't get married,

286
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,440
just like Uncle Chen Dairong.

287
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,000
If someone forces me,

288
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,159
I'll shave my head and be a nun.

289
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,679
You? A nun?

290
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,399
You won't let go of your hair.

291
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,679
What will you do

292
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,480
if meeting someone you like in the future?

293
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,799
Tell us about it.

294
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,159
You won't lose anything.

295
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,120
Yeah.

296
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,840
OK. Let me think.

297
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,039
Let me think.

298
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,600
If I get married in the future...

299
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,600
My name is Zhang Qi.

300
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,200
If I get married in the future,

301
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,559
he can't be very tall.

302
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,679
I prefer a knowledgeable man who wears glasses.

303
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,279
Just like Uncle Ling,

304
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,799
he should be a great scholar.

305
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,960
Here's a begonia flower.

306
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,000
There's another one.

307
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,720
Didn't a begonia flower fall on me just now?

308
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,799
He can't be too flippant.

309
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,799
Hold on.

310
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,320
Follow my order.

311
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,360
Bend over immediately.

312
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Hold your legs tightly.

313
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Keep head close to knees.

314
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,440
Damn it.

315
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,240
He has to be gentle.

316
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,639
He can't be too strict with me.

317
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,320
And the most important thing is that

318
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,240
he can't be a soldier.

319
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,480
What's wrong with soldiers?

320
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,640
Right.

321
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:55,240
If the free electron is in a positive energy state,

322
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,599
isn't it a perpetual motion machine?

323
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,319
Stupid.

324
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,440
So stupid.

325
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,640
Pauli exclusion

326
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,119
must prevent positive electrons from

327
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,720
making the transition to negative ones.

328
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,559
Dirac's conjecture makes sense.

329
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,519
So the Sea of Dirac exists.

330
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,319
That's true.

331
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,440
Sir,

332
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,759
I come to visit you.

333
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,559
Go away.

334
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
I don't know you.

335
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,720
I don't want to see you.

336
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,559
Go away. Go away.

337
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,519
I don't want to see you.

338
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,480
Sir.

339
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
What are you doing?

340
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,079
You look astonished.

341
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,240
Who are you looking at?

342
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:55,880
Nobody.

343
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,240
It's just a cat.

344
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,279
Ice cream? I'll buy some.

345
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,279
Yes.

346
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,200
Me, too.

347
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,400
OK.

348
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,359
Sir,

349
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,799
are you OK?

350
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,240
Go away. I don't want to see you.

351
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,400
So boring.

352
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,559
What bad luck.

353
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,319
I know that I let you down.

354
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,079
In the past six years,

355
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,519
you didn't answer any letter I wrote to you.

356
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,480
Actually today I'm here to apologize

357
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,759
and learn from you.

358
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,359
I really miss the way you used to blame me.

359
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,640
I don't have time to blame you.

360
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,000
And I burned all your letters.

361
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,960
I burned them all.

362
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,079
I know you had high hopes on me.

363
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,240
But I let you down.

364
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,960
I applied for the military school

365
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,720
without telling you.

366
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,480
Mr. Zeng.

367
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,200
What's that?

368
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,599
What's that?

369
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,900
[Application of Dropping Out]

370
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,160
Stop, Zhang Qi.

371
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,599
Stop.

372
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,400
No, no, no.

373
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,799
You should leave.

374
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,480
I don't understand it.

375
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,960
Can't the 19th Route Army

376
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,839
and the Songhu Armistice Agreement be without you?

377
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,559
A student as you are,

378
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,400
you don't focus on your study

379
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,240
but leave at your will.

380
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,559
You think fighting is only about holding a gun?

381
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,359
Then you read all my letters?

382
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,920
Yes.

383
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,720
Of course.

384
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,359
If I don't read them, how could I blame you?

385
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,559
You... Sit down or go out.

386
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,200
Don't stand here like a stick

387
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,519
to make me look up to an ingrate like you.

388
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,440
I'm asking you.

389
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,480
With the determination to go into the society,

390
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,480
Why bother to come to a man like me

391
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,920
who doesn't care about the outside world?

392
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,839
What can I do for you?

393
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,240
As a matter of fact,

394
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,799
this time I do face something difficult and

395
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,839
would like to ask you for help.

396
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,839
What's your problem?

397
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,039
I have an official job

398
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,079
recruiting cadets for

399
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,640
the Central Aviation School in Fuhua.

400
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,279
I asked President Zhou and Mr. Meng before.

401
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,559
But they didn't support it.

402
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,039
So I want to ask you to help me.

403
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,480
Silly.

404
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,799
Since you don't use your head in the army,

405
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,000
you are silly now.

406
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,960
University is a place to go into scholarship.

407
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,440
It shoulders the responsibility of

408
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,880
inheriting the culture of a country, a nation.

409
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,440
President Zhou and Mr. Meng

410
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,920
have their principles.

411
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,079
What's so different about me?

412
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:23,839
You do come to have a try here.

413
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
How dare you!

414
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,599
I'll tell you.

415
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,319
Firstly,

416
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,880
I don't have a student like you.

417
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,000
Secondly, my students are

418
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,640
the future of physics.

419
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,960
They should play a bigger role on another front.

420
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,079
They can also save a country.

421
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,519
Thirdly...

422
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,599
There's not a third one.

423
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,079
You should probably leave.

424
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,440
I don't want to see you.

425
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,079
Sir...

426
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,680
I don't want to see you in this uniform.

427
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,759
Leave now.
I'm not your teacher.

428
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:51,359
Leave now.

429
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:51,839
Sir...

430
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,960
I don't have a student like you.

431
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,440
Why does a soldier like you come here?

432
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,240
You should leave.

433
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,960
Go away.

434
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,480
Sir.

435
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,440
Go away.

436
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,039
Sir.

437
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,119
It's...It's you.

438
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,200
It doesn't matter.

439
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,359
Uncle, what's wrong?

440
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,640
What's the matter?

441
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,920
I come to send you a popsicle.

442
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,960
No.

443
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,640
Sir, sir.

444
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,559
Uncle.

445
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,119
Idiot.

446
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,319
Still so silly.

447
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,519
Don't you know it hurts?

448
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,119
You're still so stubborn.

449
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,480
You still don't know how to protect yourself.

450
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,480
You piss me off.

451
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,839
You piss me off.

452
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm so mad.

453
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,880
Sir,

454
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,880
Zhang Qi and Nianqiao joined the army

455
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,000
to repay your kindness.

456
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,440
On January 8th, 1932,

457
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Nianqiao brought Poshan back to Peiping.

458
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,759
He also brought back

459
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,160
the news of the death of the Zeng family.

460
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,039
Upon hearing it,

461
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,160
you stayed in bed for half a month.

462
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,240
What do you mean?

463
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,279
What's your point?

464
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,440
Our country has been trampled and

465
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,759
our loved ones slaughtered.

466
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,000
Someone has to stand up to protect our country.

467
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,200
Sir,

468
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:41,000
let me protect you and Poshan.

469
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,039
Let young people

470
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,240
who want to protect the country

471
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,519
go out of school.

472
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,079
You sound like you're singing.

473
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,920
Since I can't sing,

474
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
you think I don't know music?

475
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,359
Fine.

476
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,440
We're even now.

477
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,125
As for your recruitment notice,

478
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,675
let's follow the old rules.

479
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,200
You have to finish the punishment
you didn't finish at school.

480
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,400
Do you remember it?

481
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,039
You mean shooting the night view
of the Western Mountain?

482
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,759
I haven't finished it.

483
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,640
Then go to shoot it.

484
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,200
I'll tell you new requirements later.

485
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,039
Deal.

486
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,319
The Cloud View Pavilion on the Mountain in Fuhua

487
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,720
is the best place to shoot the Western Mountain.

488
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,079
Today is too late.

489
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,319
Tomorrow at sunset,

490
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,960
I'll shoot at the Pavilion.

491
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,480
Then I'm looking forward to it.

492
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,440
Sir,

493
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,000
now I'll leave.

494
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,759
OK.

495
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,039
Thank you a lot.

496
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,240
That boy.

497
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,559
The sun...

498
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,920
What?

499
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,519
Did you find anything?

500
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,359
Look.

501
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,319
It's my courtesy name "Mu Bai".

502
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,799
And that's "Yu".

503
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,000
This one underneath seems like "Dan".

504
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,240
But the strange thing is that

505
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,480
"Dan" has three scratches.

506
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,039
It's like a mistake.

507
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,160
But it's also like a deliberate act.

508
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,839
Since I've been reading it,

509
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,160
I come up with three words.

510
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,359
What's your opinion?

511
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,279
"Xing Shuai Xi"

512
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,200
Yes. It's "Xing Shuai Xi".

513
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,640
Mr. Jin,

514
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,680
on this oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding

515
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,319
there are three scratches and cinnabar marks.

516
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,240
Lanshan and I have carefully

517
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,480
studied these three scratches for many times.

518
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,480
It should reprsent three characters

519
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:50,960
"Xing Shuai Xi".

520
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,200
History and astronomy are integrated in China.

521
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,559
What's the meaning of "Xing Shuai Xi"?

522
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,680
It means stars are heading west.

523
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,000
This piece is not just for divination.

524
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:07,559
It also recorded a great meteor shower

525
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,880
during the Wuding Dynasty.

526
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,359
It's an astronomical phenomenon.

527
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,359
It's a secret hidden in this piece
for thousands of years.

528
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:19,200
If there's anyone in the world
who can solve this mystery,

529
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,039
it must be you.

530
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,119
Now the news and the photos
that spread around the world

531
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,519
are only about the character piece of

532
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,440
oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

533
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,200
On the other side of it,

534
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,440
there are three characters "Xing Shuai Xi".

535
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,839
That's the secret

536
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,519
that only the three of us know.

537
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,319
Right.

538
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,720
So that means Professor Jin is

539
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,079
trying to tell us something.

540
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,519
But what is it?

541
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,839
It means...

542
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,000
Mu Bai,

543
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,440
please go to Dan Yu to find

544
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,519
the oracle bone inscriptions of Wuding.

545
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,160
Dan refers to the rising sun

546
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,480
and the beginning of a day.

547
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,599
It should be a location.

548
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,759
Yu...

549
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,799
Professor Jin raises pigeons.

550
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,799
Maybe it means that he has pigeons.

551
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,480
But there's no pigeon in the dovecote.

552
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,039
That's odd.

553
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,319
Where are pigeons?

554
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,920
What are you doing?

555
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,319
The weather is pretty good.

556
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,200
Here.

557
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,119
Why talking about the weather?

558
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,519
So suspicious.

559
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,599
Me? Suspicious?

560
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,720
I can always hear gunshots

561
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,799
in the south these days.

562
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,200
Do you think there's going to be a war?

563
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,079
I don't know.

564
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,000
But this summer,

565
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,880
Uncle Ling had intended to take me to

566
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,319
excavate cultural relics in Anyang.

567
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,119
But the Institute of History and Philology

568
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,200
stopped all excavations.

569
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
I heard that it was to avoid

570
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,119
the loss of cultural relics.

571
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,559
The archaeological conference
of the Japanese scholar

572
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,599
on the 29th of last month

573
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,240
 has also been postponed to tomorrow.

574
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,240
In your opinion,

575
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,200
Is it a good choice to quit school and join the army?

576
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,440
Do you support our father's point of view?

577
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,880
I only stand for myself.

578
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,420
Then you support me?

579
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,759
A man has to be responsible.

580
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,160
Grandfather and father

581
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,960
are born to devote themselves to education.

582
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,599
But I am born to be a soldier and save our country.

583
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,880
Fine.

584
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,960
I know that my brother is a grown man.

585
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,799
Want to see the sunset on the Western Mountain?

586
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,400
The weather is pretty good.

587
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,039
Why talking about the weather?

588
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,160
So suspicious.

589
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,640
The Cloud View Pavilion on the back hill in Fuhua

590
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,160
is the best place to see the sunset 

591
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,480
in the whole Western Mountain.

592
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:10,880
Do you want to go or not?

593
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,039
Now?

594
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,759
Then let's invite Poshan and Qianying
to go with us, OK?

595
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,359
Let's go.

596
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,200
OK.

597
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,839
Be careful.

598
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,000
Let's have a rest.

599
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,720
West Mountain has one of the eight
greatest scenic spots in Peiping.

600
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,640
The Sunny Western Hills after Snow.

601
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,000
But it's summer now. What a pity.

602
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,319
Didn't you say that you would come here?

603
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,000
Have a drink with me first.

604
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,720
Meng Haitang,

605
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,799
today you are so weird.

606
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,599
A naughty child as you are,

607
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,000
why are you not in mood today?

608
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,200
Are you sick?

609
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,359
Nothing. I just don't like hiking.

610
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,240
You...

611
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,160
Aren't you the one who

612
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,640
insisted on hiking this afternoon?

613
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,279
Right.

614
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,119
I wonder what's fun here.

615
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,720
It will soon be dark.

616
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,559
Going back isn't easy.

617
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,039
And we still have a little burden.

618
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,839
Where's our little burden?

619
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,799
Qianying.

620
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,200
Qianying.

621
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,440
Ling Qianying.

622
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,440
Qianying.

623
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,720
What should we do?

624
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,400
What should we tell Uncle Ling?

625
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,480
Don't panic.

626
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,359
I grew up in mountains.

627
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,240
I'm sure I could find her.

628
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,680
She said that she'd like to climb the mountain.

629
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,400
I wonder if she went up the mountain.

630
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:55,319
Go up?

631
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,079
So many paths here.

632
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,559
How long will it take us to find her?

633
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,519
How about that?

634
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,920
Let's go separately.

635
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:00,880
Haitang can't be alone.

636
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,480
You two are a team.

637
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,119
I'll go that way.

638
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:02,920
OK.
No.

639
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,880
There are three paths.

640
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,000
One for each person.
Be quick.

641
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,640
Can you do it alone?

642
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,599
Let's go. Don't waste time.

643
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,200
Let's go.

644
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,400
You said you came here to find this girl.

645
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,680
Why is it taking so long for your sister to come up?

646
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,599
How could you two

647
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,200
let her be alone?

648
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Haitang must be lost.

649
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,039
Anyone here?

650
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:57,839
That's my sister.

651
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,119
Haitang.

652
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,559
Anyone here?

653
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,400
Haichen.

654
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,519
Qianying.

655
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,599
You stay here.

656
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,639
I'll go to rescue her.

657
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:10,959
Haitang, don't be afraid.

658
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,079
Someone's coming to rescue you.

659
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,000
Don't move.

660
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,599
Thanks for your help today.

661
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,840
You're welcome.

662
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,199
I just hope next time we meet

663
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,719
I won't be so tired.

664
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:47,960
Let me introduce.

665
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,599
He's my brother Meng Haichen.

666
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,719
He's Zeng Poshan.

667
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,440
She's Qianying.

668
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,159
He's Zhang Qi,

669
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,079
an instructor in Jianqiao Central Aviation School.

670
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,239
Instructor Zhang,

671
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,039
we went to watch you fly yesterday.

672
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,760
You flied a plane gallantly like a bird in the sky.

673
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,159
It turns out that you're my sister's...

674
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,159
Nonsense.

675
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,519
I mean

676
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,880
he's the one sharing life and death

677
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,039
with you in the sky that day.

678
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,119
Shut up.

679
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,719
Why do you come here?

680
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,440
The road here is steep.

681
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,440
Haitang wanted to see the sunset.

682
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,920
No, it's not me.

683
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,280
Miss Meng,

684
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,360
I can clear up the misunderstanding

685
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,440
in the newspaper.

686
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,320
Don't worry.

687
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,719
I won't agree with the feudal marriage.

688
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,679
You too, right?

689
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:50,840
Sure.

690
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,239
Then let's have a drink together.

691
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,519
Please make a witness for me.

692
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm going to join the army.

693
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,000
Really?

694
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:02,599
Poshan,

695
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,920
let's go to the 29th Military Academy Corps.

696
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,599
No.

697
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,320
Captain Zhang,

698
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,199
I prefer Jianqiao Central Aviation School.

699
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,840
I want to be a pilot.

700
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,840
I'm here to recruit pilots.

701
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,880
Then I also want to go, brother-in-law!

702
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,199
What?

703
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,760
Besides, you haven't graduated from high school.

704
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,639
Dad won't agree with you.

705
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:32,719
Don't scare me with dad.

706
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,679
You have done a lot of things
he didn't approve of.

707
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,880
Haichen, how old are you?

708
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,000
Seventeen.

709
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,480
But I'll be eighteen soon.

710
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
Why do you want to be a soldier?

711
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,039
Heroes emerge in troubled times.

712
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
I want to be a hero.

713
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,280
A pigeon!

714
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,960
See! A pigeon.

715
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,559
Isn't it Uncle Jin's pigeon?

716
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,960
How do you know that?

717
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,079
It keeps flying to our house.

718
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:09,679
The ring it wears is different.

719
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,519
You see.

720
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,800
There's a little feather on it.

721
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,800
Miss Meng,

722
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,880
is the Uncle Jin you mentioned

723
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,480
Professor Jin Zhilie?

724
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:20,280
Yes.

725
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,880
Uncle Jin lives in No.100, Yunju Hutong.

726
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,840
But he doesn't like to talk to us

727
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
or play with us.

728
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,480
Let's have a drink together.

729
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,719
That's the liquor

730
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,239
"Green Shade" Uncle Zeng has treasured

731
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,079
for many years.

732
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,199
Lanshan doesn't want to share it even at parties.

733
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,159
Looking at the beautiful scenery

734
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,159
and tasting the good liquor,

735
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:48,400
we should play a drinker's wager game

736
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,480
and establish our friendship formally.

737
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,920
We are leaning against the railing.

738
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,320
No matter verses, ditties,

739
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,119
odes and songs must be related to this image.

740
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,440
I'll be the first.

741
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,480
While leaning against the railing,

742
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,039
suddenly I find the rain stops.

743
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,960
I, Meng Haitang,

744
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
would like to be friends with you all my life.

745
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,800
Good.

746
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,760
OK. Now it's my turn.

747
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,039
Leaning over the railing,

748
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,199
I could see the peaks
shrouded in clouds and smoke.

749
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,800
Ling Qianying

750
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,599
would like to be friends with all of you.

751
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:22,800
Great.

752
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,440
Great.

753
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:25,960
Now it's my turn.

754
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,639
Going upstairs,

755
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,199
we lean against the railing
to see the moon rising.

756
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,159
Zeng Poshan would like to follow
Instructor Zhang's example

757
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:38,239
to dedicate to our country.

758
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,199
OK. My turn.

759
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,280
I look at my precious sword long.

760
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,320
Pound all the railings with my hand.
But nobody knows why.

761
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,400
I climb the tower high.

762
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,079
Meng Haichen would like

763
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,559
to be friends with all of you.

764
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,880
We lean over the railing to
enjoy mountains and rivers.

765
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,360
But these mountains and rivers

766
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,199
are in danger now.

767
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,320
Don't repeat what Qianying said.

768
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,280
Say another one.

769
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,320
Leaning against the railing to see the wind and clouds,

770
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,760
we can't do nothing and stand by.

771
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,239
No egg can remain intact under the ruined nest.

772
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,199
Let's confront the storm together,

773
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,000
nobody could just stand by.

774
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,559
I have never heard it before.

775
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,840
Where is it from?

776
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,000
It's from Spring View in Gaoguan Pavilion

777
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,079
by the poet Chen Sanli.

778
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,480
The original sentence is

779
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,800
Leaning against the railing
to see the wind and clouds,

780
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,280
we could do nothing but just stand by.

781
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,639
Our country is in turmoil.

782
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,079
We can't just stand by.

783
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,280
I think that's the meaning of

784
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,880
the change in your verses.

785
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,960
Guys,

786
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,760
today we can meet up with each other here.

787
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,199
Six gentlemen sacrificed their lives
for righteousness in 1898.

788
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,079
Nowadays Shen Junru and Li Gongpu

789
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,480
are saving our country from great danger.

790
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,599
Then let's be Five Gentlemen
Leaning Against the Railing.

791
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,000
Do you agree?

792
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:13,800
Good.

793
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,719
Even if we are separated in the future,

794
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:18,840
don't forget the oath not to stand by.

795
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,119
Wait a moment.

796
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,159
Count my brother in.

797
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,840
So it will be Six Gentlemen Leaning Against the Railing.

798
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,360
And my eldest cousin, too.

799
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,239
Yes.

800
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,679
My idols are all included.

801
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,599
Fine.

802
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,280
Come on.

803
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:34,960
Heaven and earth can prove

804
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,159
that we are Seven Gentlemen
Leaning Against the Railings.

805
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,000
Dad.

806
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,360
Dad.

807
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,760
Dad.

808
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:02,880
What's the matter?

809
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,079
I saw one of Uncle Jin's pigeons.

810
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,000
Where?

811
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,039
On the Western Mountain.

812
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,840
How could you make sure it's Uncle Jin's pigeon?

813
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,639
Because those pigeons are different.

814
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,320
It had a feather branded on its leg.

815
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,440
So Haitang recognized it at once.

816
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,039
Pigeons.

817
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,320
Still pigeons.

818
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,480
Qianying, go back to sleep.

819
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,079
Let's go.

820
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,000
OK.

821
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,760
Don't be so late next time.

822
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,159
OK?

823
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,440
Pigeons.

824
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,000
No wonder I think 023 is overweight.

825
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,199
Someone used the bilge to carry smuggled goods.

826
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,519
To hide these things,

827
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,800
he even welded twice.

828
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,480
But it damaged the fuel tank.

829
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,360
They put a knife around our neck.

830
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,519
They used fighter planes to do it.

831
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,199
Besides, as soon as this plane arrived in Peiping,

832
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,880
the smuggled goods were hid there.

833
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,800
Those bastards.

834
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,960
If only they were so active in the war.

835
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,519
How about that?

836
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,280
Let's submit these goods to

837
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,119
Peiping Aviation Defense as evidence.

838
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,000
Detain the plane temporarily.

839
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,960
When the investigation is over, send it for repair.

840
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,000
OK. I'll arrange it right away

841
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,639
Follow the original plan the day after tomorrow.

842
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,360
I'll go to Qinghe to fly Fuxing 024 to Hangzhou.

843
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,119
OK.

844
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:03,180
♫ A high wind is brewing. Ripping the thorns ♫

845
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:11,080
♫ Seize every day to seek justice ♫

846
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:18,530

♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

851
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:49,260
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

852
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:57,060
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,210
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

857
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:44,980
♫ Sincerity blooms all over the land ♫

858
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:52,010
♫ See the man of iron raise his gun ♫

859
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:59,830
♫ The pursuit in the words of scholars ♫

860
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:06,180
♫ Guard every inch of our territory with life ♫

861
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:19,080
♫ Look back in the end. My love for my homeland stays ♫
