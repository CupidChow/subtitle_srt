[Episode 23]

3
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,360
Go to hell!

4
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,719
Another one was shot down!

5
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,879
The enemy starts to evacuate.

6
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,400
Nianqiao calculated the position accurately.

7
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,680
He's right behind the first fleet.

8
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,280
Hanguang Squadron is as formidable as ever.

9
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
Searching for Xishan.

10
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,080
730 095.

11
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,280
Head to the city

12
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,159
and meet 099 765.

13
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
Intercept the second fleet.

14
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,520
Right.

15
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,719
Poshan will...

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,319
will find the chance to parachute.

17
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,400
All members of Hanguang Squadron,

18
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,240
fly in a different formation
to keep our enemies away.

19
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,840
Copy that!

20
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,560
Look, signal!

21
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,879
There's a light signal on the ground.

22
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,439
Find the target.

23
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,160
Found the first target. Drop the bomb.

24
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,199
The Chinese warplanes are after us.

25
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,680
Don't fight them. Once we drop the bomb,

26
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,519
return immediately.

27
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,279
Sir.

28
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,639
Sir.

29
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,040
Are you all right?

30
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,759
Are you all right?

31
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,439
I'm fine, I'm fine.

32
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,680
Do you need to see a doctor?

33
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,879
Go and do a head count.

34
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,040
See if there are any casualties.

35
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:01,720
Go.

36
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,639
Sir.

37
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
The physics lab was bombed.

38
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,040
Did you see Professor Zeng?

39
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,600
I did.

40
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,759
He just ran in there.

41
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's go.

42
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,360
Go.

43
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,439
Hong'en.

44
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,279
Wake up.

45
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,519
Hong'en, Hong'en.

46
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,600
Hong'en.

47
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,600
Hong'en.

48
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,759
Are you okay?

49
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,079
Get up.

50
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,560
Get up.

51
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,959
Did you get hurt?

52
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,639
No.

53
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,480
No.

54
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,519
I'm all right.

55
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,040
Mr. Zeng!

56
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,279
- Professor Zeng.
- Professor Zeng.

57
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,560
- Mr. Zeng!
- Professor Zeng.

58
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,759
Professor Zeng.

59
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,120
Zeng Mu!

60
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,519
Professor Zeng.

61
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,959
Mr. Zeng.

62
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,879
- Zeng Mu!
- Professor Zeng.

63
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,279
- Mr. Zeng.
- Professor Zeng.

64
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,879
Zeng...

65
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,639
Professor Zeng.

66
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,959
Why the yelling?

67
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,199
You're like an annoying donkey.

68
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,279
Are you all right?

69
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,199
I'm a survivor.

70
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:12,959
Let's get out of here.

71
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,319
There's someone else inside?

72
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,000
Come on.

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,279
Don't come over. Don't.

74
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,319
What is this?

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,879
Thank goodness it's still here.

76
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,959
What... what is it?

77
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,120
That's the precious thing I told you about.

78
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,399
So you ran first

79
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,199
every time because of this?

80
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,720
Set up a kinetics lab for me.

81
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,600
Otherwise we'll always get bullied.

82
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,480
I'll apply for it right away.

83
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,000
We can build our own aircrafts.

84
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,600
We'll build them on our own.

85
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,160
OK.

86
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,399
Father.

87
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,279
Haitang.

88
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,519
Father!

89
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,079
Haitang.

90
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,720
Father!

91
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,399
Father.

92
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,399
Look.

93
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,639
This place has been burned down.

94
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,279
Father.

95
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,600
It's not like I'm dead. Why are you on your knees?

96
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,639
Go, get lost.

97
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,240
Let's get back.

98
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,159
Or Poshan's wedding will be delayed.

99
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,759
It'll be ominous.

100
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,320
Let's go.

101
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,039
Father!

102
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,000
Poshan.

103
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,159
Poshan...

104
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,600
Poshan...

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,960
Poshan, he...

106
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,679
What's wrong with him?

107
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,759
He...

108
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,840
Mr. Meng.

109
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,320
Father.

110
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,879
Haitang!

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,720
Haitang!

112
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,340
♫ I write with a pen, opening my heart to you ♫

Are you all right?

Zhang Qi.

128
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,679

00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,399
Let's go home.

135
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,820

141
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,919
Am I an accurate shooter?

142
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,039
No wonder you're the candidate for captain.

143
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,159
I got a nickname for you.

144
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,399
Xishan Killer.

145
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,360
Xishan, Xishan.

146
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,720
Four enemy planes are after you.

147
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,679
Get rid of them now.

148
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,519
Xishan got shot.

149
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,120
The tube of the engine ruptured.

150
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,399
My view got obstructed.

151
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,039
Xishan is running out of fuel!

152
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,320
Xishan, I order you to parachute now.

153
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,399
Xishan, control the height.

154
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,120
Fly away from the city.

155
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,759
The campus.

156
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,200
Yuanyin.

157
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,320
Xishan has crashed.

158
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,039
Yuanyin.

159
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:13,919
Repeat.

160
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,399
Xishan has crashed.

161
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,000
Yuanyin.

162
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,080
Poshan isn't dead.

163
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,679
He's not gonna die.

164
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,679
Let's pay tribute to Martyr Zeng Poshan.

165
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,240
Fire.

166
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,919
Fire.

167
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,840
Fire!

168
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,519
He's still alive.

169
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,679
I can feel that.

170
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,440
I'm sure he's still alive.

171
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,159
I can feel that.

172
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,440

Do you remember

174
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,240
you once said to me when we were fleeing

175
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,799
that if we believe it,

176

our loved ones will never die.

Tell me.

179

Poshan isn't dead, right?

180
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,600
He's still alive, isn't he?

Poshan.

183
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,279
He must be waiting for me at home.

184
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,799
He's gone home.

185
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,960
He's going to marry me.

186

I'm going to find him.

Tonight,

192
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,840
I want some time with Poshan alone.

193

she feels pain

196
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,840
because she fell in love with him.

197
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,039

198

and I knew Werther died,

199

I must die anyway.

200

He gave me everything he had.

201
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,080
The only thing I can give him

202

you gave me this gun.

You said, in the troubled times,

217
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,559
having this gun with me would reassure you.

00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,240
a person has personality,
the press has conscience,

Without these qualities,

a person will be a living dead,

328

the press will lose its value,

and the nation will be in peril.

330

If I could sacrifice my life for the press,

331
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,000
it would be my honor.

332
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,880
Where's your personality?

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,599
since they work for the government,

343
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,400
it... it couldn't be entirely wrong.

344
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,759
Look at me.

345
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,200
What you said is right.

346
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,680
Then why can't you even look at me?

347
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,880
Zhenzhu, please don't push me.

348
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,039
I'm not pushing you.

349
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,359
I just want to know who they are

350
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,759
and why do they want to get Mr. Ling's manuscripts.

351
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,079
I... I don't know.

352
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,519
I only know the man who took the manuscripts

353
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,079
is named Xu Te.

354
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,440
They said

355
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,160
we should delay Mr. Ling's writing

356
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,880
of Study on the Yin Dynasty Calendar.

357
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,440
It'd be better if we could prevent him
from finishing the book.

358
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,440
They also said

359
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,519
the book that Mr. Ling's writing

360
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,079
would certainly infuriate the Japanese.

361
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,440
So I figured

362
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,839
we couldn't make matters worse

363
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,000
for the government.

364
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,720
Xiao Hong'en.

365
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,640
Don't you know

366
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,599
you committed treason by what you did?

367
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,200
I don't.

368
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,440
I really don't know.

369
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:28,720
Zhenzhu.

370
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,119
Zhenzhu.

371
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,400
Please trust me, will you?

372
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,160
I'm begging you.

373
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,640
Please do trust me.

374
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,880
I didn't want to do it.

375
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,240
I was forced.

376
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,119
I had no choice.

377
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,880
They even used you to threaten me.

378
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,839
Tell me what I should do.

379
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,200
It wasn't my intention. It wasn't.

380
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,240
I swear it wasn't.

381
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,440
It wasn't.

382
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,119
Don't make you sound like

383
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,480
you're the innocent party.

384
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,200
Yes, they forced you.

385
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,440
But still you made this choice on your own.

386
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:01,200
And what have Zhang Qi and the others done?

387
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,160
Most members of Hanguang Squadron sacrificed

388
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,519
but they're still fighting

389
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,480
and thinking about how to fly again.

390
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,599
What about you?

391
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,599
Yeah.

392
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,960
Zhang Qi is admired by everyone

393
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,279
and he's the biggest hero in your eyes.

394
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:38,880
But me?

395
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,359
I'm just a coward.

396
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,880
Even I loathe myself.

397
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,920
Yes, you're a coward.

398
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,319
I don't care.

399
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,880
You have to undo what you've done.

400
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,079
Don't wallow in self pity.

401
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,240
I have something to give Zhang Qi.

402
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,960
I should go.

403
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,599
Zhenzhu.

404
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,880
Zhenzhu.

405
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,000
Zhenzhu!

406
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,359
Master.

407
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,799
Master.

408
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,200
There is one thing I can't understand

409
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,960
about this new book you gave me.

410
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,480
Could you instruct me?

411
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,639
Qianying.

412
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,440
Mom.

413
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,039
You can't sleep, can you?

414
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,800
I just went to knock on Master Zeng's door.

415
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,679
But he didn't answer.

416
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,880
Master Zeng...

417
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,239
I feel sorry for him.

418
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,159
Qianying.

419
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,599
Your Uncle Zeng is having a rough time.

420
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,559
You can spend some time with him

421
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,559
in a couple of days.

422
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:31,800
Alright?

423
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,719
I know.

424
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,639
Mom.

425
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,760
If that happened to me,

426
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,159
I'd also choose to die for love

427
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,760
just like Yuanyin.

428
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
By that time,

429
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,199
don't feel sad for me, will you?

430
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,239
Qianying, you're still young.

431
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,000
Mom, I'm not young.

432
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,199
I've turned 20 already.

433
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,480
Mom.

434
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,280
Do you think

435
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,000
Nianqiao will feel more burdened

436
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,480
now that Poshan has gone?

437
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,760
He has Master Zeng,

438
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,960
Zhang Qi and the Squadron to take care of.

439
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,679
Qianying.

440
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,760
Everyone was born

441
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,920
with his own responsibilities.

442
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,639
Under pressure,

443
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,719
we make our own choices.

444
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,039
You said you're no longer young.

445
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,519
So let me ask you,

446
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:29,719
do you know

447
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,599
what are the signs of being an adult?

448
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,559
We take responsibility for our own choices.

449
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,159
Probably you can't understand

450
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,239
what I said yet.

451
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,159
When you can actually

452
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,440
take responsibility for your own choices,

453
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,760
you will know what I mean.

454
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,079
Alright, go to sleep.

455
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,260
[Grave of Qin Poshan and Xu Yuanyin]

456
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,639
Why did Mr. Zeng insist on

457
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,920
engraving the character "Qin"?

458
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,360
I don't know, either.

459
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,280
These days,

460
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,360
he's never talked to anyone.

461
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,719
I visited him several times,

462
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,559
but I was given a cold shoulder.

463
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,960
Captain,

464
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,960
don't feel too bad about this.

465
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,360
But he's right.

466
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,679
It was me who modified Xishan

467
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,360
and removed the drop tank.

468
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,960
But if you didn't do so,

469
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,599
the airspeed couldn't be increased.

470
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,119
Five versus fifteen,

471
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,199
I'm afraid half of our squadron

472
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,440
would sacrifice instead of Poshan alone.

473
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,159
So there was nothing wrong

474
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,199
about your modification.

475
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,159
I can't fly a plane right now,

476
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,480
nor can I fight

477
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,079
and avenge our dead brothers.

478
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,360
I can't defend our country,

479
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,119
what's the point of living like this?

480
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,480
Captain.

481
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,639
We communists

482
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,519
not only fight for our family, comrades and friends

483
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,599
who died in the war.

484
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,800
Have you ever wondered

485
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,119
why our drive got strengthened

486
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,199
after all the setbacks we experienced?

487
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,679
Do you have the answer in mind?

488
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,280
Because communists

489
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,559
never give up

490
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,920
and never fear failure.

491
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,360
Yes, we never give up,

492
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,559
and never fear failure.

493
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,679
We fight

494
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,000
for our 400 million compatriots.

495
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,440
In war, fathers who lost their sons,

496
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,480
children who lost their homes,

497
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,639
and couples who lost their lovers,

498
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,920
they all need our protection.

499
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,280
We're sparks.

500
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,320
Though we're weak now,

501
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,320
we're never too small to make a difference.

502
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,039
Hanguang Squadron

503
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,320
has lost Ding and the others.

504
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,239
The Seven Gentlemen

505
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,400
has lost Poshan and Yuanyin.

506
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,599
But you and I are still alive.

507
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,000
Right.

508
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,440
We still have people to protect.

509
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,760
So I have to pilot again.

510
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,000
How will you do that?

511
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:11,800
The lead aircraft

512
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,960
that Tactic of Flying Swing needs

513
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,079
has to be flied by me.

514
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,280
But there's a bullet in your body.

515
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,400
I just need to take it out.

516
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,039
I disagree.

517
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,119
You can't be impulsive.

518
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,159
That surgery

519
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,440
has a failure rate greater than 80 or 90%.

520
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,800
But there's a ten percent chance
that it will succeed.

521
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,159
Have you ever thought about your grandpa,

522
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,280
your father,

523
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,920
your family,

524
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,119
and Haitang?

525
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,960
What's more, Ding's mother

526
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,320
treats you like her own son.

527
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,320
If anything happens to you,

528
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,800
what are they supposed to do?

529
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,679
Sir.

530
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,519
Sir.

531
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,400
Zhang Qi is here to see you.

532
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,360
I haven't seen you in a long time.

533
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,920
I'm worried.

534
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,960
Just go.

535
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
I don't want to see you.

536
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,119
Zhang Qi.

537
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,199
Mr. Zeng is...

538
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,320
I understand.

539
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,639
Oh right, Madam,

540
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,760
I have something to tell you

541
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,360
and Mr. Meng.

542
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:41,460
