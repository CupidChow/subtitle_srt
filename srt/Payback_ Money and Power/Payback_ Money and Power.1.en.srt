When he grabbed my hand,
something tugged at my heartstrings.

100

He was probably happy to see you
and not the ladies from the teahouse.

so you're stealing the construction deal?

162
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,195
What nonsense is this?

163
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,114
My goodness.

164
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,449
You were the one who asked me for a loan.

165
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,870
You weren't forced to use my money, right?

166
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,501
Chairman.

167
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:31,212
Please, wait just a bit longer. I'll…

168
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,506
Please, wait a little longer.

169
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,758
I'll do anything to pay you back!

170
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,177
Know your place, you bastard.

171
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,847
Chairman.

172
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,437
I do things according to law.

173
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:54,360
You sign it over to me,
and let's finish this amicably.

174
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,452
<i>Myung In-ju,</i>
<i>Myeongdong's godfather of loan sharks.</i>

175
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,540
<i>Known as the Gentleman of Myeongdong,</i>

176
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,585
<i>but his notoriety in business</i>
<i>is anything but gentlemanly.</i>

177
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,682
We can't let him go home like this.
Take him to the sauna to wash up.

178
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,687
You, let's talk.

179
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,698
-Eun Yong, was it?
-Yes.

180
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,369
-Today was tough, wasn't it?
-It was fine.

181
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,788
This is all you get.

182
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,207
Take it when I give it to you.

183
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,004
Without money, you become nothing.

184
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,715
You become scum, like that fool.

185
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,595
-You have a license?
-Yes.

186
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:09,185
My former chauffeur stole money from me,

187
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,688
so I cut off his hands.

188
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,149
He'll have to drive one-handed now.

189
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,410
Seong-tae tells me
you memorize numbers well.

190
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,788
He tells me you get the job done.

191
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,125
Do you want to stay as Seong-tae's fist?

192
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,462
Or do you want to follow me,
a merchant of money?

193
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,133
<i>A real opportunity has arrived.</i>

194
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,885
I'll work for you.

195
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,139
All right.

196
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,357
Oh, come on!

197
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,568
-You lost.
-I mean, but why?

198
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,155
-Oh, a motorbike!
-Hurry! Let's go home and…

199
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,909
-Yo, Jang Tae-chun!
-Uncle!

200
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,125
<i>Uncle Yong was always busy,</i>
<i>so whenever he paid a visit,</i>

201
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,335
<i>I was always so happy.</i>

202
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,183
Let's go.

203
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,854
<i>Uncle Yong never kept his promise</i>
<i>to take me to the amusement park.</i>

204
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,230
You home?

205
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,734
<i>But he really bought us an apartment</i>
<i>with two bathrooms.</i>

206
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:45,156
Yong, I think I might cry.

207
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:49,077
Stop fussing. It's nothing.
Come here. Look at the back.

208
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,453
Come here, yeah?

209
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:57,710
-Wow. Look at the sunshine.
-So amazing.

210
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:02,381
<i>When Uncle started making money,</i>
<i>Mom quit her job at the teahouse.</i>

211
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,300
<i>She opened her own place.</i>

212
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,386
<i>She went from being a service girl</i>
<i>at Yeokjeon Teahouse</i>

213
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,347
<i>to a madam at the Forget-Me-Not Bar.</i>

214
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,146
<i>She still wore thick makeup,</i>
<i>left home at night,</i>

215
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,525
<i>and came home drunk in the morning.</i>

216
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,574
Seong-tae.

217
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,702
Seong-tae.

218
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:41,003
<i>My goal was to enter law school</i>
<i>and become a prosecutor.</i>

219
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,089
LAW SCHOOL

220
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:48,344
<i>But since I wasn't too bright,</i>
<i>I barely got into a rural law school.</i>

221
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,639
<i>I studied for the bar</i>
<i>before I even started college.</i>

222
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,599
<i>All I did was study.</i>

223
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,019
<i>The bar is more about patience</i>
<i>and persistence than brains.</i>

224
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,773
<i>It's a test of endurance</i>
<i>towards your goal.</i>

225
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,616
<i>I wanted to succeed</i>

226
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,244
<i>more than anything.</i>

227
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,331
<i>A prosecutor punishing forces of evil</i>

228
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,876
<i>in the most awesome way.</i>

229
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,871
You didn't fail to make the list
because you lack the skill.

230
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,540
Han, that bastard--

231
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,501
He's church buddies with the commissioner.

232
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,672
HAN SEOK-WON, 30TH CLASS

233
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,927
All right, man. Cheer up.
I'll see you next month.

234
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,721
All right. Talk to you later.

235

00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,437
Chief Han.

238
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,065
Your task force is up for change. Amen.

239
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,654
Our chief just got a promotion.

240
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,323
What else matters?
Of course I'll be there.

241
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,075
Yes.

242
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,328
I'll see you Thursday.

243
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,791
Chief Han, I love you.

244
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,334
Yes. Talk soon.

245
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,474
Good morning, Chief.

HWANG GI-SEOK - CHIEF PROSECUTOR
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS

247
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,396
-Who are you?
-Jang Tae-chun, 40th class of the Bureau.

248
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,606
We met last time we all went out.

249
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,691
Oh?

250
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,027
Did I see you at a reunion?
Which class are you?

251
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,822
Not Seoul University.
I'm from Gwangjin University.

252
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,574
-We went to drink after a meeting--
-Gwangjin University?

253
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,577
Never heard of it.

254
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:21,706
The way you dealt with
Han Kwang-yeon's case,

255
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,457
it was truly inspiring--

256
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,710
Okay, okay. Thank you.

257
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,714
I'll work hard to join your department
and become your junior--

258
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,258
Hey, what did you say your name was?

259
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,928
-Jang Tae-chun.
-Who says I'll be your senior?

260
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,598
Who do you think you are?

261
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,311
I'm sorry.

262
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,021
No need to apologize.

263
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,527
You keep it up.

264
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,198
Have a good day.

265
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,546
Prosecutor Choi is on sick leave.

266
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,174
You take care of
the police dispatch cases.

267
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,386
You're dumping petty crimes
and shit cases on me again.

268
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,929
Hey.

269
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:23,517
Every case is urgent
and important to the victims.

270
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:29,315
Okay, I'll be sure to finish these cases
without error or mishap.

271
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,443
Listen, kid.
Prosecutors don't discriminate.

272
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,157
Speaking of which,
can you sign off on this case?

273
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,409
It's about Assemblyman Baek's son.

274
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,162
It's a critical case
for the youth born into poverty.

275
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,916
He was given an advantage
in the company's hiring process?

276
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,584
Yes.

277
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:53,255
If you approve the warrant,
I'll dig enough that news stations--

278
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,926
Do you want to join
Special Investigations that badly?

279
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,388
Prosecutors must not get personal.

280
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:04,183
-Personal feelings, greed, personal life--
-What about a personal sense of duty?

281
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:09,146
-It's a typical corruption-of-power case--
-Not enough evidence.

282
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,651
-That's why it needs to be investigated--
-This isn't a case to be taken lightly.

283
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,236
I'll look at it later.

284
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:22,993
-I'll get more information for you.
-I'll look at it. Stop for now.

285
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,038
You don't get it, do you?

286
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,707
I do.

287
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,591
There's a case in that pile
that may cause a media storm.

288
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,637
Take care of it quietly,
so it doesn't create noise.

299
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,806
Give him the biggest fine possible

Mr. Nam Sang-il?

00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,898
My name is Jang Tae-chun, a prosecutor.

Oh, yes?

323

Could you look at this?

324
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,279
Wow.

325
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,532
Considering we've never met,
this must be urgent.

326
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,284
You were with Special Investigations,

You know Yeouido Rambo well?

330
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:04,715
When I was with Special Investigations,
I proposed he be investigated.

331
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:09,511
This little rat. We should have caught him
when we had the chance.

332
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,766
Did you find anything on him
during your investigations?

333
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,896
We didn't even launch the investigation.
The prosecutor was preoccupied.

334
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,148
Who was the prosecutor in charge?

335
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,653
Chief Prosecutor Hwang Gi-seok.

336
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,371
I think you get my drift.

340
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,023
The senior secretary for civil affairs
wants to see you.

341
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:06,193
Right. About the new-hire prospects.

342
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,364
I think he got in trouble
with the president.

343
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,366
He didn't take care of his own.

344
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,202
Yes. I assumed it was about that.

Twenty parcels of land in Yongin,

bought for 3.4 billion won

Whose land is it?

349
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,091
Not sure. It's not mine.

350
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:36,640
That damn secretary had a reason
for being so confident before me, huh?

351
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,350
Well, I'll be!

352
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:43,439
If you give this to Secretary Kim,
the president will take care of him.

353
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,108
Hey, Gi-seok.

354
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,611
I rearranged my office.

355
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:55,075

Old-timer loan sharks used bookkeeping

The same applies for this.

There is an elderly loan shark
who knows this stuff.

13, 5, 09, 27, at 13% discount.

470
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,007
Five-month expiration on September 27.

471
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,384
-Is that right?
-Yes.

472
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,723
They're coming next week,
so adjust the numbers.

473
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,350
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

474
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,273
-Enjoy the food.
-Okay.

475
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:05,542
<i>In those times, loan sharks used numbers</i>
<i>like a code language.</i>

476
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:10,088
<i>They wrote it backwards, switched odds</i>
<i>with evens, added the date, etcetera.</i>

477
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,840
<i>There were many ways to do it.</i>

478
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:20,015
<i>Thinking of the past, I paid off my debt</i>
<i>of Tae-chun's promissory note.</i>

479
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:35,488
<i>While my uncle decoded the code</i>

480
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,366
<i>all the way in Mongolia…</i>

481
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,915
<i>I collected information on Solar Bio.</i>

482
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,759
<i>Finally, at the break of dawn,</i>

483
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,220
<i>I received a fax from Uncle.</i>

484
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:07,562
<i>The key to decoding the numbers</i>
<i>in the anonymous source material was…</i>

485
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:12,025
25780.

486
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:16,946
The many numbers in the document,
the key to it all, is 25780.

487
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:23,995
These five digits reveal the real numbers
in Solar Bio's original document.

488
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,917
I found each of the convertible bonds
in that list before you.

489
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,129
So, I tell you to take care of a DUI case,

490
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,757
but you bring me
a stock-price manipulation case?

491
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,177
Chief, if you look
into the convertible bonds,

492
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,222
two companies benefited
from the manipulation:

493
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,809
Beauty Sparkle,
Rambo's girlfriend's company,

494
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,227
and GMI Bank.

495
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:51,856
Both companies have a major shareholder
whom Rambo calls "head honcho."

496
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,693
It's Chairman Myung In-ju.

497
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,988
This is, without a doubt, insider trading.

498
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:02,450
Do you even know who Chairman Myung is?

499
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:06,663
He's the master manipulator
of the stock market and a con man.

500
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,583
Chief Hwang Gi-seok's father-in-law.

501
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,044
<i>Your rival.</i>

502
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:20,343
File for warrant.

503
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:22,846
Yes, sir.

504
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,307
They're here!

505
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:27,517
They're coming!

506
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,313
-Over there! In the back!
-Is it true?

507
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:35,775
Lee Chang-min,
known as Yeouido Rambo, is being arrested

508
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,194
on allegations
of stock-price manipulation.

509
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,947
Prosecutor-in-charge Jang Tae-chun

510
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:46,327
said he will be giving a brief
about what exactly took place.

511
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:51,249
The dividends went to two companies:
Beauty Sparkle and GMI Bank.

512
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,794
Although Lee's girlfriend is the owner
of Beauty Sparkle,

513
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:57,964
we've confirmed that the actual CEO
is Lee himself.

514
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:02,927
It is rumored that Rambo's head honcho,
Chairman Myung, was behind it all.

515
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,346
Are you going to investigate
Chairman Myung also?

516
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,391
What motivated you to pursue this case?

517
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:12,479
What does the other company, GMI Bank,
have to do with anything?

518
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:15,857
<i>An official investigation has launched</i>
<i>against Chief Hwang Gi-seok</i>

519
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,903
<i>and his in-law Chairman Myung's</i>
<i>stock-price manipulation suspicions.</i>

520
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,448
<i>I knock out the chief prosecutor</i>

521
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,701
<i>and go to Special Investigations.</i>

522
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,580
We cannot discuss further matters
of this ongoing investigation.

523
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,533
<i>Sir?</i>

524
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:08,660
<i>Sir.</i>

525
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,955
Did you confirm
the quarterly report sent via fax?

526
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,916
Yes. The numbers look good.

527
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:19,212
Be honest. You didn't see it, did you?

528
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,465
I can tell what the numbers are
by hearing your voice.

529
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:26,511
<i>How long are you going to be stuck</i>
<i>at that place?</i>

530
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:30,807
<i>Our biggest investors would really like</i>
<i>to see our chairman's face.</i>

531
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,517
Why do they need to see my face?

532
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,770
It's better for both sides
if I stay here and buy more land.

533
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,398
Oh, right. Did you search what I asked?

534
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,275
<i>I told you, I told you.</i>

535
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,944
You clearly didn't see the fax.

536
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,698
Those numbers your nephew sent over,

537
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,951
<i>it has to do with Chairman Myung,</i>
<i>as you predicted.</i>

538
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:53,580
Wait.

539
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,629
YEOUIDO RAMBO
MARKET MANIPULATION?

540
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:05,008
He's still the same:
filthy rich and greedy.

541
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:10,388
Isn't Chairman Myung your mentor
in the money business?

542
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,183
It was an ill-fated relationship.

543
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,396
Let me ask you one more favor.

544
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,108
Nice shot!

545
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,487
Those balls are flying high today. Killer!

546
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:31,034
This isn't going to be a problem, Father?

547
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,119
MYUNG IN-JU
CHAIRMAN OF MYUNGIN HOLDINGS

548
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,663
Of course not. That kid knows nothing.

549
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,541
I have strong support from you.

550
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,668
I'll take care of my business.

551
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:43,171
Please be sure to tie up any loose ends
on your end.

552
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,467
Why are you whining? Don't worry.

553
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,719
I'm clean.

554
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:54,098
You say you're clean,
but it's happening again.

555
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,689
Your father's properties are fine, right?

556
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,819
A truck driver to a property owner, huh?

557
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,697
He's getting pretty fat.

558
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,408
He needs to exercise.

559
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:21,501
Don't worry about Yeouido Rambo.

560
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,754
I have a strong lock on his lips.

561
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:31,844
I'm clean.

562
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,014
I have no problems. You understand?

563
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:38,726
Yes.

564
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,479
You should exercise too.

565
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:46,150
I put some new clubs in your car trunk.
Use them for work when you need to.

566
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,669
Rambo, that idiotic bastard.
How did the prosecution get that file?

567
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,045
KIM SEONG-TAE
DIRECTOR, GMI BANK

568
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:08,256
The night he got his DUI,
he lost his bag at the club.

569
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,300
-Club?
-I sent my men over there to check.

570
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,137
That little shit.

571
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,014
Something smells fishy.

572
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,655
You found it?

573
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,657
-Yes, sir.
-Play it.

574
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:10,943
Stop.

575
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,489
Zoom in.

576
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,787
This is the girl who stole the files
and turned him in?

577
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,663
She's cute.

-Here, let me.
-Forget it. Just forget it.

Why am I called to your office
all of a sudden?

588
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:04,330
Of course, I asked my chief

I think you misunderstand.

590

I hate difficult cases.
That's why I quit Special Investigations.

you'll see my face clearly.

Yeouido Rambo, right?

All kinds of names come out
if you dig into such cases.

599
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,037
You're a newbie prosecutor.
You think you can handle it?

Mr. Nam,

601

my mom gave birth to me at 19
and raised me by herself.

602
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:55,506
She was a maid, a server.
She did whatever she could to raise me.

00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:26,722
So, Chief Park.

623
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:31,143
About your investigation
into our GMI Bank…

624
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,856
We're only investigating by the rules.

625
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:41,654
Is that why you're meeting the subject
of your investigation?

626
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,909
Well, you're my senior.

627
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:49,829
If this makes you uncomfortable,
I'll leave the table.

628
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,917
Where I am is where you'll be.

629
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:58,170
Don't work too hard.

630
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,383
You can eat the food from the bowl…

631
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,554
but don't break the bowl.

632
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,310
Hey.

633
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:15,980
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Oh.

634
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,485
-We just got here.
-Yes, sir.

635
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:23,029
I was at the Supreme Office.

636
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,282
Jeong-su, been a while.

637
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,577
Why the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

638
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,581
The deputy office post at the Pusan office
will become vacant soon.

639
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,124
We were talking about that.

640
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:39,712
Jeong-su, isn't Pusan your hometown?

641
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:42,840
That's right.

642
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:45,342
Wow. I can't believe I forgot, Mr. Oh.

643
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,359
I understand your concern,

644
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,572
but this investigation began
with Chief Park's approval.

645
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:14,538
We have to get Chairman Myung
to strike Chief Hwang, so to speak.

646
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,125
What are you whispering for?

647
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,628
People have been saying that
for eons already.

648
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:30,763
Do you really think Chief Park's goal
is to go after Chief Hwang?

649
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,974
What do you mean?

650
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:37,228
A prosecutor's true power isn't showcased

651
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,481
when they exercise the power to prosecute,
but when they choose not to.

652
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:46,487
They can't cover it up like old times,
so they're choosing a middle ground.

653
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,490
A middle ground?

654
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,332
It's Chief Park, isn't it?

655
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,173
Good job. Search and seize Sparkle
and table the investigation.

656
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:08,509
How come you're only approving half of it?

657
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:11,470
We have to hit GMI Bank
to get Chairman Myung--

658
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:15,015
You just need to dig into Sparkle.
It'll get you enough to indict Rambo.

659
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,810
Just get something in writing
for GMI Bank and drop it.

660
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,855
Is this because GMI's CEO
is your predecessor?

661
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,192
I need to show him some manners, don't I?

662
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:29,113
You did well with the investigation.
You got to be on TV.

663
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,699
Your work evaluation deserves
an A-plus-plus.

664
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,785
When promotion season comes around,
you'll hear good news.

665
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,663
So, do I get to go
to Special Investigations?

666
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,667
Damn it, kid.

667
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,920
Your dreams are swelling
now that you got a taste for the cameras?

668
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:51,677
You went to Gwangjin University, right?
I'll get you a position over there.

669
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:56,390
Why would you want to be a tail?
Lay your foundation at your turf.

670
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,560
Even rice-farming companies
are competitive in Seoul.

671
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,229
-Chief--
-Do you have an appointment tonight?

672
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,649
No. Not really.

673
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,026
Good.

674
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:10,196
Choi and I need to attend
our professor's 60th.

675
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:12,907
-You stay overnight tonight.
-What?

676
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,951
Rambo! Good work today. Hey.

677
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,542
Order something expensive tonight.

678
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:46,190
<i>Among judges, prosecutors and lawyers,</i>

679
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:51,028
<i>I heard prosecution is the only place</i>
<i>you can make it big with skill alone</i>

680
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,948
<i>regardless of your background,</i>
<i>and that's why I chose it.</i>

681
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,449
You're the prosecutor?

682
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,868
-Yes.
-It's a high-school senior.

683
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:01,455
I gather from her suicide note
she took her life because of her grades.

684
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,013
Confirmed.

685
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:20,474
Oh, okay. Please sign here.

686
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:24,979
<i>Prosecutors are all about skills?</i>
<i>I don't think so.</i>

687
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:29,024
<i>Could it be that even if I try hard,</i>
<i>what's not meant to be won't be?</i>

688
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,173
<i>Chief Park may be satisfied,</i>

689
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,218
<i>but I'm still hungry for more.</i>

690
00:59:57,303 --> 00:59:59,388
<i>GMI Bank isn't on the warrant.</i>

691
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,266
<i>CEO Oh is getting off</i>
<i>with a written investigation.</i>

692
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,476
Prosecution is as dirty as ever.

693
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,563
<i>The case might just wrap up like this.</i>

694
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,694
After serving as a district attorney
in Seoul,

695
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,113
he ran for the assembly
to serve his nation again.

696
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:19,616
After two unsuccessful campaigns,
he took on a new challenge

697
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,329
and now leads the number one online
transaction solution company in Korea

698
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:25,956
as the CEO of Goodmoney Investment Bank.

699
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:30,169
As the CEO of a KOSDAQ-listed company,
he has begun a third chapter in his life.

700
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:33,881
A prosecutor, a businessman,
and now an author,

701
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,883
here is CEO Oh Chang-hyeon.

702
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,604
The security footage has been handed over
to Chief Hwang.

703
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,731
-Good job.
-The emcee is too honest.

704
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,359
She mentioned my failed elections too.

705
01:00:55,903 --> 01:01:00,282
Failed elections lead to being elected.
Isn't that right?

706
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:02,785
Yes!

707
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,287
Oh, thank you.

708
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:08,832
To all of you here today, I love you!

709
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,376
We love you!

710
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:19,301
Prosecute that con man Oh Chang-hyeon
for stock-market manipulation!

711
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:22,638
What are you doing?

712
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,517
Who's that crazy geezer?

713
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,312
Investigate that man
to the fullest extent!

714
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:32,481
-Security, get him out of here!
-That piece of…

715
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:33,857
Get him out of here!

716
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,449
Get him! Fire!

717
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,744
Who is that crazy fool?

718
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,126
MAN ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
AT BOOK CONCERT

719
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,462
Hey, what happened to that man?

720
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:57,798
His whole body is burned, but he'll live.

721
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,466
Damn it.

722
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:02,928
I'll approve the previous warrant.
Search and seize GMI Bank.

723
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,138
What?

724
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:08,517
Kid, the world knows about the case now.

725
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,812
Let them see the search-and-seize.
Make it a photo op for you.

726
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,981
Take a huge box that says "prosecution."

727
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,065
Okay.

728
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,902
Damn it.

729
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,865
-There they are!
-Wait!

GMI BANK

731
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,250
-Look over here!
-Look over here!

732
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,922
Will CEO Oh of GMI Bank get
his summons today?

733
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:41,758
Did you cut him some slack
because he's a former prosecutor?

734
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,677
I can't speak about
an ongoing investigation.

735
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,014
However, if there are suspicions,

736
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:50,601
the prosecution will consider
nothing sacred and will not hesitate.

737
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,940
Do we have anything useful?

738
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:58,525
We already lost on timing.

739
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,736
Just taking empty boxes
will be meaningful.

740
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,779
CEO Oh is now subject to investigation.
