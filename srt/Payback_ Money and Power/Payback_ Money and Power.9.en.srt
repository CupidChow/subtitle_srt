1
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:06,947
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, CASES,

2
00:00:06,947 --> 00:00:09,947
AND THE SETTINGS OF THE PROSECUTION
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,230
Your nephew who beat up a teacher.

4
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,774
Did he cause trouble again?

5
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,861
Well, Mr. Eun,

6
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,531
what brings you here today?

7
00:01:55,615 --> 00:02:00,328
I executed a stock-manipulation strategy
against Chairman Myung.

8
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:02,788
Is that right?

9
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,709
So that was your handiwork?

10
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,963
Hang on. I thought I heard a rumor
that the mighty Chairman Myung

11
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,549
suffered a great loss
to a counter-strategy.

12
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,595
All right. How much did you make?

13
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,222
A little over 11 figures.

14
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,435
Ten, hundred, thousand,
10,000, 100,000, one million…

15
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,104
Ten billion?

16
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,023
Ten billion won?

17
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:31,901
Wow! Astounding!

18
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:34,111
PROSECUTOR LEE SU-DONG

19
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:36,864
Hold on.

20
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:39,825
You're not here talking to a prosecutor

21
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,495
just to boast of your prospects
from working the stocks.

22
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:46,248
This doesn't look like
a confession either.

23
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,126
What is it you want?

24
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,842
Look who this is.

25
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:03,057
It's been a while, Chairman Myung.

26
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:10,564
I mean, Manager Eun over here,
he has a knack for memorizing numbers.

27
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,695
He told me some
of your borrowed-name accounts.

28
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,115
I found lots of issues.

29
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,960
Eun fled Korea on an early flight.

30
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,506
Geez. That damn son of a bitch.

31
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:40,886
As for Lee Su-dong, he's received a bribe
of bearer bonds worth one billion won.

32
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:45,057
And he left them as security
at the gambling joint last night.

33
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,481
How much did he gamble away?

34
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,817
He lost his entire loan of 50 million won

35
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,820
and spent 20 million more
in exchange for his prosecution key card.

36
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,533
The card sharps I sent
to play against him--

37
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,493
Did he notice them?

38
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,372
Well, he basically loses his shit
when he's given a hand,

39
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,832
so he didn't notice a thing.

40
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:16,130
If he keeps this up, we might reclaim
the one billion won he got

41
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:17,715
in two to three months.

42
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,384
Even if we reclaim the bonds,

43
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,096
lend him up to five billion
and get a written promissory note.

44
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,098
I'll give you the money.

45
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:30,936
But the card sharps' winnings
are retrievable anyway.

46
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,897
Why go that far?

47
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,150
Eun Yong, that fucker,

48
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,654
handed over the borrowed-name accounts
of the Supreme Office seniors to Lee!

49
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:44,950
If we are to retrieve them too,
we need Lee tied down.

50
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,786
Yes, sir.

51
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,871
PROSECUTOR LEE SU-DONG

52
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:01,383
Hey, man. The hell did you drive wasted?

53
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,510
Man.

54
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,346
The hired driver was fuck--

55
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:07,848
was running late.

56
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,975
So you ram your car into a police station?

57
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,144
Where there are cameras
all over the place?

58
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,480
You can't get away with that.

59
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:18,025
As far as the public is concerned,
drunk driving is socially unacceptable.

60
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,444
Sir, what are you doing tonight?

61
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,905
Buy me a drink. I'm in a bad mood.

62
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,991
Heck! Haven't you learned your lesson?

63
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,327
You're a shame to our alma mater.

64
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,455
You better not attend the reunions,
understood?

65
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:33,749
You disgraceful imbecile.

66
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
Sir.

67
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,794
Sir.

68
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,796
Hey, man!

69
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,761
Geez. Unhelpful as always.

70
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,410
Our dear Prosecutor Lee.

71
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,537
How has it come to this?

72
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,498
Chairman, what brings you here?

73
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,375
What do you mean?

74
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,085
Heard you were getting fired,

75
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,629
so I came to collect my loan.

76
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,559
Your key card lost its effect as security.

77
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,815
Excluding the one-billion-won
bearer bonds,

78
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,402
you still owe me 2.76 billion won.

79
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,198
What shall we do about that?

80
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,754
I believe you remember Eun listing me
your borrowed-name accounts,

81
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:03,047
so I looked into them.

82
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,926
This is my investigation report.

83
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,429
BORROWED-NAME ACCOUNTS

84
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,058
Let's call it even.

85
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,645
You've no conscience.

86
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:21,690
My 2.76 billion won for this?

87
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,986
What else can I do
when my prosecuting days are over?

88
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,031
You want me to take this to the papers
and expose everything?

89
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,992
Shall we go down together?
Yeah, that's it.

90
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,036
Let's go down together, huh?

91
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,830
All I've left besides my gambling debt
is my loud mouth.

92
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,917
I've nothing left to lose anyway.

93
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,503
Look here, Lee Su-dong.

94
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,839
You have plenty to lose.

95
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,470
How about you kneel before me?

96
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,597
Can you do that?

97
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:06,110
If you do that,
I'll call it even for the interest.

98
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,532
You can pay off the principal
by working as my attorney.

99
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,672
Wait-- Chairman.

100
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,224
Please have mercy.

101
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,020
I'm a drunk driver
and a dishonored retiree.

102
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:44,982
An ordinary prosecutor
to just another ordinary attorney,

103
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,150
that money--

104
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,652
How will I ever pay it off?

105
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:53,365
Allow me to work with you
in your money business.

106
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,869
I'll do anything you ask.

107
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,495
Chairman…

108
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,671
Okay.

109
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:12,384
Chairman, Chairman. My dear Chairman.

110
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:16,764
As you requested,
we sucked all their capital dry,

111
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,932
and they're beginning their delisting.

112
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,893
All right. Good work.

113
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,230
To prevent getting sued
by the damaged investors,

114
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,399
I'll have to have a drink

115
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,487
with my friends
at the Suwon District Prosecution.

116
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,406
-How shall I pay for the expenses?
-I got you covered.

117
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,617
Make them drink like fish,

118
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,536
but be sure you take care of business.

119
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,747
Of course. Salute!

120
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,501
By the way,

121
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,171
what about the thing
I asked you to look into?

122
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,506
Right.

123
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:53,217
-About Prosecutor Hwang Gi-seok?
-Yes.

124
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,887
Matchmakers for the filthy rich
have been hounding him.

125
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,473
He's not seeing anyone right now.

126
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:02,351
He doesn't drink,
gamble, or have lady problems either.

127
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,479
-What about his family?
-His father is a trucker.

128
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,857
-I think his family is in some debt.
-Really?

129
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:14,947
Perhaps it's time for us to get someone
who may be of some use for a long time.

130
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,908
Oh, right. There's one thing.

131
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:21,078
I'm told he's quite ambitious.

132
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:22,454
Very proud too.

133
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,248
That's good.

134
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,875
What are you planning?

135
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,797
I've thought this through, all right.

136
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,183
What do you want?

137
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,855
Seeing that you're visiting me here,

138
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,691
I'm sure you want to talk in private.

139
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,360
Okay.

140
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:55,737
Okay.

141
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,824
The Bawoo Fund incident.

142
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,535
Lee Su-dong will be the scapegoat.

143
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,914
But as you know,
he's not enough to cover up the case.

144
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:09,751
That's why I'm planning to bring
Jang Tae-chun into the game

145
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,963
as the insider who leaked information.

146
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,133
How does his uncle feel about this?

147
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,348
But if you're willing to help us out,

148
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,852
we could go with a different narrative.

149
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,314
Let's face it. You're going to rot here.

150
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:33,108
No need for your nephew
to come here too, is there?

151
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,445
You want me to take the bullet
for Tae-chun?

152
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,492
I'm a con artist
of an international hedge fund

153
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,829
and a violent criminal
who's charged with homicide.

154
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,499
It does make more sense, huh?

155
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,085
You catch on so quick.

156
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,713
I love that.

157
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,884
But it's such a trite narrative, no?

158
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:01,553
Mr. Kwon.

159
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,905
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

160
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:23,992
How's the US investigation going
with the Jukich mutual fund?

161
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:28,872
The Jukich Fund?
Why are you asking about Russian mobsters?

162
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,834
Just do some research
and send it to Mr. Kwon.

163
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,884
JUKICH HEDGE FUND
STATUS REPORT

164
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,220
A New York hedge fund: Jukich 54.

165
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,806
Its CEO is Russian.

166
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,849
He's known for his filthy deals.

167
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,018
CEO PROFILE
VASILY GRIGORIEVICH ZAITSEV

168
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:54,815
I gather this isn't cooked,
since you're handing it up front.

169
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,280
You sure about this?

170
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:02,906
Of course.

171
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,827
<i>If one were to categorize Hwang</i>
<i>as an investor type,</i>

172
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,914
<i>he's the type who'd want a portfolio</i>
<i>filled with fancy global brands.</i>

173
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,294
This global hedge fund which received
Bawoo Fund's investment

174
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,837
known as Jukich 54

175
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,673
is under FBI investigation
for suspicions of insider trading,

176
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:21,925
and all its accounts have been frozen.

177
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,514
If you point to Wall Street
for the fund's filing for bankruptcy,

178
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,851
wouldn't that disperse
the nation's anger a bit?

179
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,979
The VP's embezzlement
will seem more believable too.

180
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,857
Mention it's a cooperative effort
with the FBI.

181
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,068
It'll look much better for your office.

182
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,530
While our office is
in full cooperation with the FBI,

183
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:47,784
we hope to use our resources
to compensate damaged investors.

184
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,543
And your conditions?

185
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:04,134
I'm already in quite a pickle,
so I won't ask for much.

186
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:10,390
As the Special Investigations' lead,
I wish to uphold procedural fairness

187
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:14,186
by recusing myself
from this investigation.

188
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,897
The newly formed Bawoo Fund Task Force

189
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,150
will be led by our seasoned investigator
Chief Lee Yeong-jin,

190
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:24,029
specially appointed to report directly
to the attorney general.

191
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,207
<i>As a safety measure on my part,</i>
<i>include my nephew</i>

192
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,085
in the investigative team.

193
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,003
This investigative team

194
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:45,425
consists of a group of prosecutors
vetted for their uprightness and skill.

195
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,678
I daresay they are the best we have.

196
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:13,203
You're saying it was Yong's idea
to tie things to Jukich?

197
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:15,038
I spoke with Hong.

198
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,332
She confirmed the information
is fabricated by them.

199
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,254
I wondered why Jang was on the team.
That explains everything.

200
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:24,673
How are things on your side?

201
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:26,925
Not good.

202
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,387
This special investigative team,
or special cover-up team,

203
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,932
swiped all our investigations of Myung.

204
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,561
I'm empty-handed and back to square one.

205
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:44,317
I didn't think
Myung would make such a bizarre move.

206
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,028
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,574
Nothing for you to be sorry about.
I'm responsible for this too.

208
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,410
I'll find a way somehow.

209
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,790
Right now, we should all be careful.
Especially those working on the inside.

210
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,086
If you visit Eun,
tell him to lay low and wait it out.

211
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,758
Myung went ballistic once.
He might not hit the brakes next time.

212
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,309
Oh, my.

213
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:21,396
Our special task force leader.
You didn't have to come out.

214
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,857
-Of course. I had to. Come with me.
-Yes.

215
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,068
We've summoned you out of formality.

216
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,904
You may leave soon enough.

217
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:32,449
Sure. Once the noise calms,
I'd love to have you at my villa.

218
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:33,617
I'd love that.

219
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:38,288
By the way, have you taken care
of the prison incident?

220
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,124
-It'll be done by today.
-Great.

221
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,878
Those bastards.

222
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:51,384
Inmate 4816.

223
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,805
-Something happen?
-What?

224
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,308
There was an order

225
00:16:58,391 --> 00:17:01,353
to transfer your bodyguard thugs
to another prison.

226
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,980
I'm also being assigned
to the women's ward,

227
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,441
so I won't be able to assist you
for a while.

228
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,276
Something feels strange,

229
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,778
so please be careful.

230
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,543
<i>The second risk:</i>

231
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:30,173
<i>The protective wall I created in prison</i>
<i>can be taken away at any time.</i>

232
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,720
<i>I've never been one to lose out</i>
<i>on money, connections, or my fist.</i>

233
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,141
<i>I just persevere and fight.</i>

234
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,357
Let Han-nah know what's happening here.

235
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,443
Tell her to call
the director of corrections.

236
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,195
Then all will be well.

237
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,489
Are you going to be okay?

238
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,326
Shall I request to see the director now--

239
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,205
You know that won't do a thing.

240
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:05,000
Don't worry about me.

241
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,546
I survived juvie, didn't I?
Came out on top in that fearful place.

242
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,216
Just hang in there.

243
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,469
I'll do everything to get you out.

244
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,555
What are you thinking?

245
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:20,891
You bringing in the guns
to execute a jailbreak?

246
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,977
If you want.

247
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:26,938
Don't worry.

248
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,610
I have the money to get by in here.

249
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,988
Anyhow, it's reassuring
that my attorney is ex-military.

250
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,564
So, did you visit Yong?

251
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,360
He says he's fine, but his situation
doesn't seem that way.

252
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,614
If he sounded too reassuring,

253
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,117
it means it's really bad in there.

254
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:27,457
Are you sure Yong can clear his name?

255
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,086
If this goes well,

256
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,297
I'll personally see to it
that you get out of Korea safely.

257
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,551
I was always curious.

258
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,223
What is it between you two?

259
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,316
We're family.

260
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,196
Family?

261
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,074
Family…

262
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,662
I see.

263
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,374
Yong's always been protective

264
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,918
of his family.

265
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,089
Attorney Park,

266
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,634
I always keep my promises.

267
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:21,678
However…

268
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:27,100
I have to go someplace
before I get to work.

269
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,697
The soup is pretty refreshing.

270
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,409
You're such a devoted daughter.

271
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,372
Did you sign the deed of transfer?

272
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,210
Do you intend to take the apartment
we're living in as well?

273
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,383
None of your wealth is under your names.

274
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,890
Don't look at me like that.

275
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:10,143
I'm only taking the money
because you are my daughter.

276
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:14,022
If it were anyone else,
I wouldn't end here.

277
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,121
Lee Jin-ho's kidnappers
are Joon-gyeong's security detail?

278
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:34,542
They left not one bit of evidence
at the kidnapping scene,

279
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,545
which means one thing is for sure:

280
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:42,467
Like her security detail,
she's an accustomed professional too.

281
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:47,055
No evidence is evidence…

282
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:50,725
Park's motive is clear
if she's allegedly behind all this.

283
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,811
But such speculations--

284
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,022
Are only speculations,
so warrants are out of the question.

285
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,110
Could you get us through the door
at your uncle's penthouse,

286
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,486
where Park's staying?

287
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,906
This is a favor you're asking

288
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:07,534
of the homeowner's nephew
and not the prosecutor, right?

289
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,078
Yes.

290
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,133
POLICE INVESTIGATE!
PROSECUTION INDICTS!

291
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,552
BENEFIT TO THE PEOPLE!
INVESTIGATIVE STRUCTURAL REFORM!

292
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,011
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT OFFICE

293
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,228
Yes, Tae-chun.

294
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,482
-Did you take Lee Jin-ho?
-What are you doing?

295
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,736
<i>I'm not asking as a prosecutor</i>
<i>but on a personal basis.</i>

296
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,407
Did you kidnap Lee Jin-ho?

297
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:53,997
Yes.

298
00:22:54,747 --> 00:22:56,833
<i>I'm busy now. Let's talk later.</i>

299
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,183
Let's speed things up.
Tae-chun's found out about this.

300
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:19,439
I'm so proud Tae-chun became a prosecutor.

301
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,942
Isn't that right, Grandma?

302
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,360
DEACONESS KIM JEONG-SUN

303
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,737
Know what, Grandma?

304
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,240
This woman's from Seoul Law School.

305
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:32,076
Remember Yong always spoke
so proudly of her.

306
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,540
Grandma, you were closer to him than I.

307
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,002
When I was in prison,

308
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:44,839
he got you the hospital VIP suite.

309
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,094
Sounds like Yong.

310
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,850
I wanted to live all flashy like him,

311
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,937
so I did any shit I could.

312
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:01,814
But life is just--

313
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,623
Time…

314
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,585
isn't on my side, is it?

315
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,506
If you keep using, no.

316

Oh, yeah.

00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:37,684
Now that I've seen Grandma…

318

let's go.

319
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,905
A true gangster

320
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:53,616
pays his debts.

321
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,861
Jin-ho, what's up?

322
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:31,321
Been a while, Chang-hae.

323

Oh, shit!

Fuck. You crazy?

326
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,253
If you need drugs, just ask.

327
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:51,799
Bitch, you've been feeding me poison.
Should I shoot you up with one right now?

328
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,428
You know how I can get.

329
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:58,139
You better answer me the first time.
Where's the ledger?

330
00:25:58,222 --> 00:25:59,766
Oh, shit--

331
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,975
What ledger?

332
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,604
I know you have
the prison warden bribe records!

333

00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,870
Chang-hae! Chang-hae!

337
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,540
Next, I'll stick it in your eyeball.

Where's that ledger?

Get everyone armed and meet me there.

may help dodge stock-manipulation charges,

456

but you'll neither be pardoned
nor given parole this time.

You have all the money outside,

It's better than dying.

You'll be guaranteed personal protection.

I reckon your 70th will be held in prison.

Your security guards aren't talking.

Let us go if you have no evidence.

you want to go by the book now?

he may have lived.

It was his decision.

470
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:36,707
He told me to keep quiet
so he could do it alone.

471
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,167
You should have told me.

472
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:43,213
-We could have confiscated the ledger--
-He specified that I not tell you.

473
00:39:43,797 --> 00:39:46,800
He said we'd lose all evidence
and witnesses.

474
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,557
You know what he meant by that.

475
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,692
But if you will stop at nothing,

476
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,196
what makes us different
from Myung or Hwang?

477
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,448
We're all the same.

478
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:12,701
Because in order to fight a monster,
you must become one.

479
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:19,833
We can't beat them by way of law.

480
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,919
See?

481
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,255
You can't even catch me
with the law you rely on so much.

482
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:36,308
Yong's been released.
Now, you stay out of this filthy fight.

483
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:37,601
Joon-gyeong.

484
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:41,980
Time's up.

485
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,691
May I go now, Prosecutor Jang?

486
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:00,607
Hey, Park Joon-gyeong!

487
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,570
You call yourself my attorney
and make me wait at Prosecution?

488
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:09,366
Why didn't you tell me?

489
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:14,120
Why didn't you discuss it with me
before you chose to do all that?

490
00:41:15,914 --> 00:41:17,499
You seem healthy enough.

491
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:20,794
I'm hungry. Let's talk while we eat.

492
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:25,715
My goodness. You drive me nuts.

493
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:29,302
You brat! Wait up, damn it.

494
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,398
You still upset with me?

495
00:41:42,649 --> 00:41:47,112
Promise me this:
that you'll never act so recklessly again.

496
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:51,992
I can't give you that.
You would've done the same for me.

497
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:56,329
Remember the first promise I made
when I returned to Korea?

498
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,957
I'll handle the dogs
like the dogs they are.

499
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:02,544
I told you I'd take on
the danger and the filth.

500
00:42:02,627 --> 00:42:04,379
Why did you take the reins?

501
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:08,550
You're the only family I have left.

502
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:13,138
So promise me this:

503
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,141
that you'll never go to jail again,

504
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:19,644
and that you'll fight by my side
to the end.

505
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:27,152
Fine.

506
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:29,988
I'll promise you that.

507
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:35,493
I'm sorry.

508
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:38,288
I made you cope with it alone.

509
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:48,340
Eating tofu after prison--
It's all just a myth.

510
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:53,845
The day we were released from lockup,
Mom made us so many tofu dishes.

511
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:00,769
No. It worked its magic on me.

512
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:03,813
If it weren't for your mom's tofu,

513
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:06,566
I would've become
just another Myung by now.

514
00:43:19,412 --> 00:43:20,663
Damn it.

515
00:43:56,825 --> 00:44:00,870
The warehouse charges are dropped,
but Oh's murder's still on you.

516
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:06,209
Here's Myung's summons record
to the Eastern District Office

517
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:08,169
the night of Oh's murder.

518
00:44:09,003 --> 00:44:13,091
Myung could have gone outside
under the pretext of a summons,

519
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:15,260
just as I did when I went to his villa.

520
00:44:15,927 --> 00:44:19,848
There's a possibility
Oh's death wasn't a suicide.

521
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,771
Is the prosecutor in charge
connected to Hwang?

522
00:44:27,605 --> 00:44:31,651
No, but he trained with Lee Yeong-jin,
Hwang's right-hand man.

523
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:34,070
-He's still at the Eastern District?
-Not anymore.

524
00:44:34,154 --> 00:44:36,489
He got into a sex scandal.

525
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,367
After that, the Ministry of Justice
sent him to the US for training.

526
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,329
They're hiding something.

527
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:48,543
If we can connect Myung to Oh's death,

528
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:50,920
you'd have your name cleared,

529
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:54,883
and break Myung and Hwang's hold
over prosecution with that final blow.

530
00:44:59,554 --> 00:45:00,972
The final blow.

531
00:45:03,057 --> 00:45:04,267
I don't know.

532
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:07,353
Would that be enough to end them?

533
00:45:12,317 --> 00:45:16,237
The truth is so easily concealed
with the power they have.

534
00:45:25,663 --> 00:45:27,874
RESTRICTED AREA
OFFICIAL DUTIES ONLY

535
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:51,940
Kim Seong-tae didn't kill himself.

536
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:55,360
Where are the other inmates?

537
00:45:55,443 --> 00:45:56,736
Warden!

538
00:45:59,697 --> 00:46:01,491
Supreme Office Investigations.

539
00:46:03,576 --> 00:46:05,119
What brings you here?

540
00:46:05,203 --> 00:46:07,205
According to the other inmates,

541
00:46:07,914 --> 00:46:11,709
Kim felt pressured
by the coercion he received

542
00:46:11,793 --> 00:46:13,378
from the prosecutor in charge.

543
00:46:14,045 --> 00:46:16,047
You interrogated him yourself, Chief?

544
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:21,094
What kind of bullshit is this?

545
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:23,596
What happened? What?

546
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,057
We're in a delicate situation, and you--

547
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,935
How can you do this
without discussing it with me?

548
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:30,019
Do what?

549
00:46:34,482 --> 00:46:35,692
Kim Seong-tae.

550
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,195
Was it you?

551
00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:41,739
What? What happened to him?

552
00:46:43,783 --> 00:46:45,827
-It wasn't you?
-Senior Chief Hwang!

553
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,413
I'll call you back.

554
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:53,751
You must all be so busy.
What brings you here at this hour?

555
00:46:53,835 --> 00:46:57,755
Is it true that you are the insider
who leaked information to Lee Su-dong?

556
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,215
-What?
-Senior Chief Hwang.

557
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:02,927
Do you have any comment on the photo
taken with Bawoo Fund's Lee Su-dong?

558
00:47:03,011 --> 00:47:04,387
A photo?

559
00:47:20,778 --> 00:47:21,779
Punk.

560
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:26,618
Is it Senior Chief Hwang?

561
00:47:28,453 --> 00:47:31,122
Oh, he's soon to be at his wits' end.

562
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,169
I had my men get rid of Seong-tae.

563
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,965
You'll get rid of that obnoxious cow
on your end, correct?

564
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:42,967
Oh, Ham Jin?

565
00:47:44,177 --> 00:47:47,472
She's been a pain over on our side too.

566
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:50,475
We'll take care of her for good.

567
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,104
You'll take care of Bawoo Fund too?

568
00:47:56,689 --> 00:48:01,361
Well, the thing is, at this point,
I can't help Senior Chief Hwang.

569
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:03,988
For your name to be kept out,

570
00:48:04,072 --> 00:48:07,492
releasing that photo
was a necessary measure

571
00:48:07,575 --> 00:48:09,243
to create enough commotion.

572
00:48:10,745 --> 00:48:14,082
It can't be helped, then.
My son-in-law will have to take the hit.

573
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:17,919
It's not like we can use photos
of powerful men like yourself.

574
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,608
PERSONNEL ORDER

575
00:48:40,692 --> 00:48:42,610
ORDER TO DISMISS
PERSONNEL FROM DUTY

576
00:48:42,694 --> 00:48:44,487
AND WAIT FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT

577
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:02,588
-Hi.
-Hi.

578
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:07,635
You went through enough already.
Take a break.

579
00:49:09,387 --> 00:49:13,057
I'm done planning the international
stock portfolios. Take a look.

580
00:49:19,063 --> 00:49:20,773
The numbers look good.

581
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:24,944
Seeing our CEO making money
is making me emotional.

582
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:30,074
Did you hear that Hwang's being sidelined?

583
00:49:30,742 --> 00:49:32,201
He's so in the wind.

584
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:36,706
Karma felt so good, so I plan to offer
a huge thanksgiving offering.

585
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:42,587
We've lost much on domestic stocks,
so I think it'll take a while to recover.

586
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:46,966
Why are you working so hard?
We have plenty of capital.

587
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:49,385
What about the tabloids?

588
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:52,472
After yesterday's close of day,
I put word into the grapevine,

589
00:49:52,555 --> 00:49:54,348
so I'm sure it's out by now.

590
00:49:55,057 --> 00:49:56,476
Commencing operation already?

591
00:49:58,102 --> 00:49:59,103
Yeah.

592
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:09,489
Oh, come on. You may drink like a whale,
but do avoid day drinking.

593
00:50:10,156 --> 00:50:14,577
Drink or investigate-- Nothing matters.
We can't touch the real deal anyway.

594
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:17,121
What's this? It fell further.

595
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:20,166
It's going down into the dumps.

596
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:23,711
How much did you invest?

597
00:50:24,378 --> 00:50:28,049
My retirement savings are quartered.
Damn it.

598
00:50:28,674 --> 00:50:31,052
What the hell? Fill it up. Don't be cheap!

599
00:50:31,135 --> 00:50:32,678
Pace yourself. Come on.

600
00:50:34,138 --> 00:50:36,808
I thought you were a stock expert.

601
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:38,726
You sniff out
all the stock-manipulation offenses.

602
00:50:39,852 --> 00:50:41,562
I can sniff them out, yeah.

603
00:50:41,646 --> 00:50:44,690
I go through the stock list,
and if something feels off,

604
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:47,944
I hit them with an interrogation
and crush them hard.

605
00:50:48,569 --> 00:50:50,530
That doesn't mean
I should buy such shares.

606
00:50:50,613 --> 00:50:53,950
In investment,
you have to find the prospective stock

607
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:55,993
and stick to rules and principles.

608
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,500
No, forget rules and principles. Damn it.
I'm dead if my wife finds out.

609
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:05,419
Yikes. There's your real problem.

610
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,840
Well, everything's
on a downward trend anyway.

611
00:51:10,675 --> 00:51:14,262
Even if everything goes to hell,
people who make money still make money.

612
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:18,099
When Bawoo Fund went bust
and the Korean stock market was a mess,

613
00:51:18,182 --> 00:51:21,811
a Singaporean funds company
turned a huge profit by short-selling.

614
00:51:23,187 --> 00:51:24,689
Singaporean funds?

615
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:27,441
I read the tabloids yesterday.

616
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:31,070
So now, investors are up in arms
about banning short-selling.

617
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:57,263
Incinerate everything in here.

618
00:51:57,972 --> 00:52:01,309
Yes, sir.
I'll move your things to your car.

619
00:52:02,143 --> 00:52:03,144
Wait.

620
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:19,076
SENIOR CHIEF HWANG GI-SEOK

621
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:35,259
PROSECUTION SERVICE

622
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,074
HWANG GI-SEOK
SEOUL CENTRAL PROSECUTOR’ OFFICE

623
00:53:10,503 --> 00:53:12,505
<i>Hwang has been sidelined,</i>

624
00:53:12,588 --> 00:53:15,007
<i>but nothing has changed.</i>

625
00:53:19,845 --> 00:53:22,056
<i>The truth is still under wraps.</i>

626
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:25,309
<i>Justice is nowhere to be found.</i>

627
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:36,737
When I was in confinement,

628
00:53:37,697 --> 00:53:39,365
I thought through the night.

629
00:53:40,992 --> 00:53:42,159
Why did we lose?

630
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:44,704
What did I do wrong?

631
00:53:46,872 --> 00:53:48,958
Suddenly, I remembered your mom.

632
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:52,294
After her unfair imprisonment,

633
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,507
what did she hope to fight against?

634
00:53:58,217 --> 00:54:01,721
Would she have stopped
at taking Myung's money and Hwang's power?

635
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,103
She may have given up because of me,
but Mom would've kept going.

636
00:54:11,022 --> 00:54:13,607
Hwang got his promotion
for concealing the truth.

637
00:54:14,191 --> 00:54:16,861
And in return,
Myung's illegal schemes were covered up.

638
00:54:16,944 --> 00:54:18,654
Both benefited from the other.

639
00:54:20,197 --> 00:54:22,700
From the rotten laws
to the money-business cartels,

640
00:54:23,325 --> 00:54:25,244
Mom would've fought to end them all.

641
00:54:28,205 --> 00:54:30,332
That's why our next battle won't end

642
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:34,336
at crushing a couple parasites.

643
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,217
We're going to wipe out
everything that's rotten.

644
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,511
How?

645
00:54:46,557 --> 00:54:48,476
I need to prepare a few things.

646
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,189
First, I prepared
a very appetizing rat poison.

647
00:54:57,747 --> 00:54:59,999
Good to see you at a place like this.

648
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:02,335
The liquor tastes good too.

649
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:07,090
What brings you here?
You even contacted me first.

650
00:55:10,593 --> 00:55:12,178
Proud of you, Yong.

651
00:55:15,932 --> 00:55:18,935
While all that went down,
you paid attention to my words

652
00:55:19,894 --> 00:55:21,813
and decided to short-sell?

653
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:24,274
I did?

654
00:55:24,941 --> 00:55:26,901
The Singaporean funds was you, no?

655
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:30,238
The timing had you written all over it.

656
00:55:30,822 --> 00:55:34,993
Only two people in the world
know how to short-sell like that.

657
00:55:35,076 --> 00:55:37,954
It wasn't me, so it must be you, right?

658
00:55:41,332 --> 00:55:42,667
I wonder…

659
00:55:45,086 --> 00:55:47,005
So who did it to Bawoo Fund?

660
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:49,966
Was it really Lee Su-dong?

661
00:55:52,552 --> 00:55:54,512
You have hidden cameras or something?

662
00:55:57,765 --> 00:55:59,058
Moving on.

663
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:03,438
Out of the two transaction deals,
I've used one up.

664
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:12,155
And I plan to sell the other to you.
So buy it.

665
00:56:15,533 --> 00:56:17,744
Hwang has been ruined,

666
00:56:19,037 --> 00:56:21,080
so how would this deal work?

667
00:56:22,832 --> 00:56:24,876
Sure, it's useless to me,

668
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,379
but you wish to know the truth
of Yoon's death.

669
00:56:30,632 --> 00:56:33,009
So this is something you absolutely need.

670
00:56:35,803 --> 00:56:37,555
How much do you want?

671
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:40,016
I'll think about it
if you quarter the price.

672
00:56:41,184 --> 00:56:42,185
No.

673
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,231
Twice what you called last time.
Otherwise, I'm getting rid of it.

674
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:51,986
You'd never give up on Yoon.

675
00:56:53,112 --> 00:56:54,822
You've made plenty of money.

676
00:56:55,907 --> 00:56:57,325
Buy it when I offer.

677
00:57:08,753 --> 00:57:09,962
On one condition:

678
00:57:11,547 --> 00:57:14,676
Take Investigations
off Chief Ham Jin's back.

679
00:57:16,177 --> 00:57:19,138
I knew you'd say that. I know you well.

680
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:23,726
You and I are both on the watch list.

681
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:28,523
This transaction will be carried out
by a Virgin Islands shell company,

682
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:31,818
where share transactions are untraceable.

683
00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:35,405
Nice and clean.

684
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:47,041
-<i>He took the rat poison.</i>
-That's good.

685
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:48,835
<i>Myung's own greed</i>

686
00:57:49,419 --> 00:57:51,754
<i>will end him for good.</i>

687
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:06,602
My goodness.

688
00:58:08,229 --> 00:58:10,314
You should at least eat, you know.

689
00:58:17,405 --> 00:58:18,990
I want to make this clear.

690
00:58:20,074 --> 00:58:22,702
I never coerced Kim to confess.

691
00:58:24,245 --> 00:58:27,331
-Kim didn't commit suicide--
-Fine.

692
00:58:27,915 --> 00:58:29,125
Yeah, I got it.

693
00:58:31,335 --> 00:58:33,296
You're cleared. You may go home.

694
00:58:34,547 --> 00:58:36,924
-Your kids must be waiting for you.
-Sir?

695
00:58:40,428 --> 00:58:43,556
I thought you were a straight shooter,
and a nuisance,

696
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:46,684
but you can't help it
when your neck is on the line, can you?

697
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:50,605
Come on. Eat up.

698
00:59:02,241 --> 00:59:03,242
Chief Ham.

699
00:59:04,368 --> 00:59:07,538
Your charges are dismissed, right?
It's a real relief.

700
00:59:09,874 --> 00:59:11,375
I might be off the hook

701
00:59:12,293 --> 00:59:15,129
because your uncle made some deal
with the higher-ups.

702
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:17,799
Am I right?

703
00:59:17,882 --> 00:59:18,883
What?

704
00:59:21,093 --> 00:59:22,261
I think I am.

705
00:59:23,095 --> 00:59:25,306
That's what it felt like.

706
00:59:30,186 --> 00:59:31,521
What the hell…

707
00:59:36,108 --> 00:59:39,153
Chief, why don't you go home for now?

708
00:59:41,405 --> 00:59:43,533
I miss Ye-ji so much,

709
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:46,911
so I just walked out. No questions asked.

710
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:51,916
But now I'm scared to go home.

711
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,963
My goal was to become a prosecutor

712
00:59:58,506 --> 01:00:00,967
my kids wouldn't be ashamed of.

713
01:00:03,386 --> 01:00:04,428
Tae-chun.

714
01:00:05,555 --> 01:00:07,139
Tell this to your uncle:

715
01:00:08,808 --> 01:00:09,934
"Thank you,

716
01:00:10,852 --> 01:00:12,311
but I want out."

717
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:16,274
Chief, quitting your job
seems like a bit much--

718
01:00:16,357 --> 01:00:17,608
I'm not quitting.

719
01:00:19,402 --> 01:00:23,239
I'm going to be more fair and square
with my methods,

720
01:00:23,322 --> 01:00:25,032
just as a prosecutor should.

721
01:00:25,992 --> 01:00:28,327
Sure, it'll be hard to win.

722
01:00:28,411 --> 01:00:30,204
But what can I do?

723
01:00:31,122 --> 01:00:32,248
I have to try.

724
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:34,542
I'm a mother, after all.

725
01:01:07,658 --> 01:01:09,118
Prosecutor Jang.

726
01:01:12,872 --> 01:01:14,790
You must be having a rough time.

727
01:01:21,881 --> 01:01:24,508
Well, of course you are.

728
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:29,680
You deal with bad people every day.

729
01:01:31,891 --> 01:01:33,726
I know a little about that too.

730
01:01:35,102 --> 01:01:38,397
I met all kinds of people
when I worked at the bar.

731
01:01:41,943 --> 01:01:43,110
Personally, I…

732
01:01:44,153 --> 01:01:48,449
Whenever I met such people,
I thought of my son and endured.

733
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:52,411
Because my Tae-chun…

734
01:01:55,748 --> 01:01:57,833
will become a great person.

735
01:02:05,716 --> 01:02:06,801
Mom…

736
01:02:10,638 --> 01:02:12,348
Chicken delivery.

737
01:02:12,932 --> 01:02:14,183
Chicken's here!

738
01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:18,604
Chicken's here!

739
01:02:21,983 --> 01:02:23,025
Jang Tae-chun.

740
01:02:23,818 --> 01:02:25,152
When did you get here?

741
01:02:30,783 --> 01:02:31,867
What's wrong?

742
01:03:10,364 --> 01:03:11,449
Uncle…

743
01:03:16,454 --> 01:03:17,788
don't call me anymore.

744
01:03:19,373 --> 01:03:20,374
What?

745
01:03:21,709 --> 01:03:25,004
Don't visit me unless it's here with Mom.

746
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,674
Why is that?

747
01:03:30,468 --> 01:03:31,635
I'm a prosecutor,

748
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:34,096
and the work you do is illegal.

749
01:03:35,973 --> 01:03:36,974
Illegal?

750
01:03:42,063 --> 01:03:43,272
You know all too well:

751
01:03:44,148 --> 01:03:47,359
Law and order will never give us the win.

752
01:03:49,111 --> 01:03:51,030
Joon-gyeong said the same thing.

753
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:53,532
But here's the thing:

754
01:03:54,492 --> 01:03:56,744
If you become a monster to fight monsters,

755
01:03:57,411 --> 01:03:59,288
you're just another monster.

756
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:03,709
I…

757
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,213
don't want to be the greatest prosecutor
in Korea.

758
01:04:08,714 --> 01:04:10,049
I just

759
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,677
want to be a great person
who is good to his mom.

760
01:04:17,556 --> 01:04:18,891
<i>Tae-chun is no longer</i>

761
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:21,560
<i>my weakness.</i>

762
01:04:24,105 --> 01:04:25,106
<i>To end this war,</i>

763
01:04:25,189 --> 01:04:26,941
<i>Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun…</i>

764
01:04:29,568 --> 01:04:31,695
<i>will be the final blow.</i>

765
01:05:09,942 --> 01:05:12,736
Do you still think you're
in a position of power?

766
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,864
Money is real power.

767
01:05:14,947 --> 01:05:18,659
I proved my power by bringing you down
with just a single blow,

768
01:05:18,742 --> 01:05:20,411
<i>even at your most powerful!</i>

769
01:05:20,494 --> 01:05:21,787
<i>If you do as I say,</i>

770
01:05:23,122 --> 01:05:24,540
<i>I'll make sure you recover</i>

771
01:05:25,124 --> 01:05:26,500
<i>everything you have lost.</i>

772
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:28,752
-What is this?
-Rat poison.

773
01:05:28,836 --> 01:05:31,297
<i>If we don't get</i>
<i>all the higher-ups this time,</i>

774
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:32,965
the truth will just be covered up again.

775
01:05:33,048 --> 01:05:35,467
<i>And they will live on.</i>

776
01:05:35,551 --> 01:05:39,054
I will fight to the end.
Not on your terms, but the law and order--

777
01:05:39,138 --> 01:05:40,681
You can't win with that.

778
01:05:40,764 --> 01:05:42,558
Justice without intellect

779
01:05:43,434 --> 01:05:44,768
is utterly useless.

780
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:49,440
Ripped and resynced by YoungJedi
