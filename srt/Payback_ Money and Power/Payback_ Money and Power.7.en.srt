1
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,707
ALL CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, CASES,

2
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,959
AND SETTINGS DEPICTED
ARE FICTIONAL.

3
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,927
PROMISING IT COMPANIES
GOING BANKRUPT

4
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,639
Shoulders are opening up too early.
You can't hit far like that.

5
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:56,891
Okay.

6
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,647
Lower the knees a bit. That's good.

7
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,066
-Like this?
-Yeah. Good.

8
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,360
-Good.
-Let's go! Go!

9
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,279
How is he?

10
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:14,825
Might not be the Son of the Wind,
but he could pass for a cousin, no?

11
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,537
No. He's studying.

12
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:21,332
BATTING CAGE - MIDDLE SPEED

13
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,626
Heard anything from your sources?

14
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,960
Sources?

15
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:30,674
Seong-tae picked up on some info
and made some cash on the side.

16
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,511
We should try that ourselves.

17
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:44,146
-Wow, Jang Tae-chun!
-Yes! Good going.

18
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:48,609
SECURITIES SUPERVISORY BOARD

19
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,332
That's our man.

20
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,458
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,270
Delivery from Myeongdong Bakery.

22
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,492
Yes, one second.

23
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,710
The Mukho Construction-UniVNT merger.
Is it a go?

24
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,963
The deal's been confirmed.
We're moving on it.

25
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,924
A yield of 0.5% per share.

26
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,093
What about the refixing limit?

27
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,596
Ninety percent of the issue price.

28
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,355
I'm home.

29
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,859
What's this?

30
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,279
Did you take out a mortgage loan
on the apartment?

31
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,949
I just needed some quick cash.

32
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,702
Doing as you please,
since you bought the place?

33
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,079
Don't talk that way. It's not like that.

34
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,125
-Have you been gambling?
-No.

35
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:32,171
I bought a few stocks.
The source is good, so don't worry.

36
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,422
"The source is good"?

37
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:35,883
I'm telling you.

38
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:40,888
It's an operational stock.
Three months, and I'm out with big money.

39
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,514
What big money?

40
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,602
Do you know how many of my customers
ruined their lives dabbling in stocks?

41
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,271
How could you think to touch our home!

42
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,400
Fine.

43
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,071
I'm a lowly bitch,
so it doesn't matter where I live.

44
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,990
But… my Tae-chun.

45
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,036
Tae-chun can't live like I did.

46
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,583
It was my life's first bet,
which I had to win.

47
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,586
ONE MONTH LATER

48
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,261
-What's this?
-You shit!

49
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,847
-You knew, you little shit.
-What?

50
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,476
-You tend to the chairman, so you knew!
-What?

51
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,895
Mukho Construction's stocks--
Why did they plummet?

52
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,857
They plummeted?

53
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,568
Damn it. He didn't know either.

54
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:43,575
The chairman sold off
his Hangang Securities stocks after-hours.

55
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,174
Yeah, keep punching.
Crush everyone already.

56
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,265
Forget the money I lost,

57
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,519
but did you lose the loan secured
on Ji-hee's apartment?

58
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,653
No wonder they say a person out of luck
falls on his back and breaks his nose.

59
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:23,449
But Myung really is a sick bastard.

60
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,744
He even managed to deceive you.
That cold bastard.

61
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,914
What's this?

62
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,173
Your shit, you bastard.

63
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:43,927
Did Myung take care of you?

64
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,306
You think he'd do that?

65
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,600
Then where did you get this money?

66
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,853
A few days after I got your money,
my money and Ji-hee's money--

67
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,774
Have you forgotten who I am?
I'm Myung In-ju, all right?

68
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,819
You know I'd never put your money at risk.

69
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,989
That's right. There's one more thing.

70
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,910
The securities firm will make sure
your stocks go up

71
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,037
when the Mukho merger happens.

72
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,042
I was listening to Myung talk
in front of Seong-tae and the ladies.

73
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,461
Okay, I'll get going.

74
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,421
-Hey, get us water.
-Yes, sir.

75
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,342
Geez.

76
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:29,014
-Suddenly, I felt chills down my spine.
-Why?

77
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:33,227
If it were real info,
he would've spoken behind closed doors.

78
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,605
But the operation
did involve Mukho Construction, right?

79
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:41,360
Stock reputation matters,
but they're only good if they make cash.

80
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:46,198
Miss the time to sell, you lose all.
Operational stocks are about that.

81
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:51,370
I wondered if I should withdraw the money
before it was too late.

82
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,663
But?

83
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,835
I felt like I'd never get the chance
to make real money

84
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,003
if I didn't seize this opportunity.

85
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,733
So every night since then,

86
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,862
I began analyzing
all of the chairman's ledgers

87
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,157
and looked into
how he strategized to turn a profit.

88
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:32,744
So yesterday morning,
I sold the stocks at my target price

89
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,831
before Myung sold his.

90
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,502
Wow. You're something else.

91
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,923
You're a legend. That's killer.

92
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,395
Where are you going?

93
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,397
It's dangerous. Get down.

94
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,609
I'm doing this because it's dangerous,
you punk.

95
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,028
Hey, Jin-ho.

96
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,198
I'm going to make a whole lot of money.

97
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,785
I'm going to make a shit ton of it!

98
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,515
Inmate 4816, you've been summoned.

99
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,983
Wow. It stinks.

100
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:48,487
Must be pretty uncomfortable here
for a rich fellow like you.

101
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,200
Yeah.

102
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:14,554
What do you say to going out tonight
for a refreshing cup of iced coffee?

103
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,352
Being like that won't work in your favor.

104
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,068
Is that right?

105
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,281
I've never been in a better mood!

106
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:39,288
Chairman, I love you!

107
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,499
Oh, no, no. It's nothing.

108
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,502
I'll be counting on your son-in-law.

109
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,756
Yes, of course. We're family, aren't we?

110
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,843
Yeah! We're family! Cheers!

111
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:58,598
I'll be seeing you, Chairman.
I trust you'll take care of everything.

112
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,267
Yes!

113
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,937
Have a safe trip back.

114
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,105
I will.

115
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,109
Oh, wonderful.

116
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,990
I'll kill you if you drive drunk again.

117
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:19,119
Sir, stop treating me like a child.
I called a driver service.

118
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,080
-Rest easy and go home.
-Fine.

119
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,999
-I'll be going!
-Yes, sir.

120
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,461
-Return safely, sir.
-Oh, I'm so tired.

121
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,962
Oh, boy.

122
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,130
Oh, my.

123
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,323
Hey!

124
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,077
-Where is my driver?
-He'll be here soon.

125
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,120
Why don't you wait inside?

126
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,915
Tell him to hurry up. Damn it.

127
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,590
1458, someone booked you
from the Japanese restaurant, right?

128
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,883
Who are you?

129
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,979
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in ten minutes, okay?

130
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,358
Haven't flaunted my skills in ages.

131
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,693
Let me sweep the tables, all right?

132
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,863
Yeah. What?

133
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,492
He's asking for dope
in the middle of all this?

134
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,870
Well, shit. Lee Jin-ho, that damn druggie.

135
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,465
Fine. Give him what he wants.

136
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,177
I'll tell the chairman
to make the payment.

137
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,096
Yeah.

138
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,776
What's happening with the ship
bound for the Philippines?

139
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,154
It's leaving next month,
on the first Tuesday.

140
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,281
Time flows so damn slow.

141
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,579
When the next delivery comes in,
bring me 300 grams.

142
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,663
That much?

143
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,666
I told you, the chairman's paying up!

144
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,837
I understand. See you at delivery.

145
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,508
Sir, Mr. Hairtail is here.

146
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,051
-He's early.
-Yes.

147
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,013
-You reserved his seat at the VIP table?
-Yes, sir.

148
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,441
Hello, sir.

149
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,485
-It's Chang-hae!
-Yes.

150
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,862
-I told you I'd be here fast.
-Yes, sir.

151
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,363
-Your table is set.
-Okay.

152
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,505
What is this place?
It looks like an abandoned building.

153
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,799
Driver, you got your money. Now go.

154
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,636
Curiosity killed the cat, okay?

155
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,515
Okay. Have a good day.

156
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,456
What were you doing out
skipping meals, huh?

157
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,876
-I'm eating now.
-You call that a meal?

158
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,255
Geez.

159
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,634
Does this place look familiar?
Myung's lawyer goes here.

160
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:08,598
If Lee goes here, it must be
a gambling joint Kim Seong-tae runs.

161
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:12,769
I'll send the pictures and the address.
Please look into this tomorrow.

162
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,981
Oh, man. Prosecutor Jang.

163
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,857
Are you going to keep doing this?

164
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,985
I'm not a prosecutor. I'm suspended.

165
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,696
All the more reason
for you not to do this.

166
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,699
What happened to Joon-gyeong,
it's all my fault.

167
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,244
My goodness. How is that your fault?

168
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,706
The thug who stabbed her
is the one at fault.

169
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,375
The bastard who paid for the attack.

170
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,378
The bastard covering for him with power.

171
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,755
I couldn't lawfully arrest either of them,

172
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,133
so it is my fault.

173
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,886
Playing Batman won't solve
the mistakes you made as a prosecutor.

174
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,263
I'm doing whatever I can.

175
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:52,434
I'm responsible for the accident,
so I'm trying anything I can.

176
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,562
Please help me out.

177
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,648
My goodness.

178
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,902
Eat up.

179
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,953
Is it Hwang Gi-seok?

180
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,584
The man who framed you
and hurt Joon-gyeong like that--

181
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,919
It's him,

182
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:21,838
isn't it?

183
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,895
About seven years ago,

184
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,149
I screwed up one of my cases
because he betrayed me.

185
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,485
Due to the stress,

186
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,655
I almost lost my first child.

187
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,574
But during those five months,

188
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,035
the person who worked night shifts

189
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,746
and took on my cases for my behalf

190
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,415
was Joon-gyeong,
the youngest prosecutor around.

191
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,251
I mean,

192
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,837
how many years has it been?

193
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,469
A little while back,
Joon-gyeong contacted me because of you.

194
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,433
That day, we parted on bad terms.

195
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:17,977
And on the next day,

196
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,730
she was assaulted.

197
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,780
That's why…

198
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,158
I stay up at night, going over your case.

199
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,453
I go over it ten, 20 times
rather than the usual two to three.

200
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,998
So screw your right to remain silent.

201
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,919
I don't need that shit. Let's cooperate.

202
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,717
From what I gather,
I'm a better ally to you than your lawyer.

00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,589
Your case has been merged
with another case.

Hwang Gi-seok!

209
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,732
You asshole! You trying to pick a fight?

210
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,944
Why would Special Investigations
from the central district

211
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,029
steal a murder case
from the western district?

212
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,658
Why are you asking me?
The Supreme Office allocates the cases.

213
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,076
Bullshit.

214
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,204
You mean the Supreme Office
decides for the central district.

215
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,082
You've pulled this frequently enough.
Forget it.

216
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:49,379
Return my case or wait for me
to storm your office with the reporters.

217
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,341
You're misunderstanding something here.
You will never get the case.

218
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,677
Check the personnel list.

219
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,305
Now you're transferring me, huh?

220
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:05,186
Is it by the beautiful sea?
Or by the mountains with fresh air?

221
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,856
Which remote area are you demoting me to?

222
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,443
Prosecutor Ham,
congratulations on your promotion.

223
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,822
Congratulations.

According to Attorney General Kim,
your lawyer,

232
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,859
you admit guilt to the warehouse incident

233
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,987
as involuntary manslaughter.

234
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,656
Do you agree, 4816?

235
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,955
Traffic to the western district
is terrible.

236

I'm glad I only need to come here now.

You're his attorney.
Of course I made it convenient for you.

238
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:17,216
But did you promote Ham Jin
just to merge the two cases?

239
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,344
You know what she's like.

240
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,431
If we do a poor job,
she'll take it to the press.

241
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,935
As expected.
You're efficient as always, Hwang.

By the way, something for you.

Has it been a month?
You look pretty terrible.

How's Joon-gyeong?

261
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,882
Still unconscious.

262
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,678
I set her up
with the best medical professionals,

263
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,180
but they say waiting is all they can do.

264
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,351
I know.
Money can't help her regain consciousness.

265

-Still--
-I'll do everything money can do.

Don't worry.

267

I have a favor to ask.

Anything.

What about the director of this place?

I just need one person I can use.

I have just the perfect person for it.

273
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,212
Give me the name.
I'll take care of it from the outside.

274
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,630
No.

275
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,216
If we pay him up front,
he'll just get spoiled.

276
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,762
We need our Canada branch for this.

DO NOT ENTER

299
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:04,819
What's this about?

300
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,032
My kid's acceptance
to a Canadian school got canceled.

301
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,202
My wife and kid are about to
get kicked out of their rented home.

your business card.

304
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,710
What's this supposed to mean?

305
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,464
That my Canada branch office used
quite a sum on your kid's school

306
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:29,177
and the property owner
of the house your family rented.

4816, you shit--

If you'd given me a quarter
of the money you spent,

I told you we'd easily be friends.

Why would you overcomplicate
such a cheap equation?

Let go, if you don't want to die.

312
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,248
Why would I be friends with you?

313

Listen carefully.

314
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,006

you don't know what money can really do.

316
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,345
If you make it to my level,

317
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,849
I can send you to hell
in the blink of an eye.

318
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,686
But…

319
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,566
why are you doing this to me?

320
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:30,863
When needing an obedient dog,
it first needs to learn who its owner is.

321
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,377
I'm sorry.

322
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,254
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,631
Please…

324
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,092
forgive me.

325
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,803
My child has no fault in this.

326
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,767
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,854
Please forgive me this once.

328
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,649
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,951
PERSONNEL LIST

330
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,288
The sixth account is
for your kid prosecutors.

331
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,665
The second account is for your superiors.

332
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,460
Check the list, see if anyone is left out.

333
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,087
Let's see.

334
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:33,342
As for the Daegu high prosecutors' office,
instead of District Chief Lee,

335
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,345
let's go for Mr. Hwang from Gwangju.

336
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,306
Is that right?

337
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,683
That's what we'll do.

338
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:45,563
Anyway, you did great in all this.

339
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,108
Promotion season is coming up.

340
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,486
Make sure not to say anything,
and make sure your funds…

341
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,285
You know what I mean?

342
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,495
Of course, Son.

343
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,165
I measure up to you now,

344
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,043
as a legit businessman,
owner of the number one finance company.

345
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,257
As always, I'll keep it clean and solid.

346
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,259
-Great, sir.
-Indeed.

347
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,727
I should have treated you earlier.
Thank you.

348
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:28,481
How was dinner? Was it to your liking?

349
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:32,151
Ms. Myung's table is always top-notch.

350
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:39,658
For dessert, sujeonggwa simmered
in ginger and honey-infused ginseng.

351
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,787
You'll need the strength
to direct nationwide elections.

352
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46,082
Oh, I'm just a nitpicky old geezer.

353
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,085
But since you made this ginseng delicacy,

354
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,880
I'll have some
and muster the strength to work.

355
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,634
Give it a try.

356
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,939
You two paint a pretty picture.

357
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:14,527
You'd be a couple to be envied
but not hated by the younger generation.

358
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,989
You'd appeal to the older generation too,
with your clean and exemplary image.

359
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,245
I owe all my prospects to my wife.

360
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,707
If you wish to enter politics,

361
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,961
it's best not to begin too late.

362
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,423
Becoming attorney general--
What use is that?

363
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:39,385
You tiptoe around the Blue House,
then take all the blame from the citizens.

364
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,262
Once you become district chief,

365
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,974
get yourself a big case, make your impact,
and get into politics.

366
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,643
Thank you, sir.

367
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:51,647
I only had indefinite plans,
but after hearing your words,

368
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,816
it feels closer to reality.

369
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,276
But here's the thing.

370
00:28:56,235 --> 00:29:00,614
If you don't resolve one thing,
it may all be for naught.

371
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,411
I apologize to Ms. Myung,

372
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,289
but it's about your father-in-law,
Mr. Myung.

373
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,959
His previous reputation
as a Myeongdong loan shark--

374
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,336
It's perfect for campaign attacks.

375
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,716
We understand.

376
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,847
At least he's left the shadows
of his loan-shark days in the past.

377
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,893
Now he's out in the sun
with the Namsan Bank funding business.

378
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,478
That's a silver lining.

379
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,606
You need money for politics.

380
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,400
But you can't do politics
with money alone.

381
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,569
Remember that.

382
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,655
I will mark your words.

383
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,679
LIST OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

384
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,061
Myung has launched Bawoo Fund.

385
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,940
But low-risk government bond investments

386
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,234
can't possibly guarantee
such dividend rates.

387
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:23,864
Bawoo Fund's actual system
is much like a multilevel Ponzi scheme,

388
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:28,911
profiting existing investors
from money invested by new investors.

389
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,540
To bring in more investors
to support the whole system,

390
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,626
they've rebranded under a trusted name:
Namsan Bank.

391
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,419
Until now, Bawoo Fund…

392
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,837
BAWOO FUND, Q1 PROFIT 10% TO 30%

393
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,589
…is a skyrocketing success.

394
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:41,840
BAWOO FUND BAGS INVESTORS

395
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,968
Myung is not the kind of gentleman

396
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:47,346
to make safe investments
staying within terms and conditions.

397
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:52,268
He'd profit big by siphoning the capital
and manipulating the market.

398
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:57,856
So which company will he go after now?

399
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,167
RESTRICTED AREA
OFFICIAL DUTIES ONLY

400
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,177
Warden, sir.

401
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,723
You haven't clocked out yet?

402
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,644
-Didn't you do the night shift?
-Yeah, I did.

403
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:39,023
I'm going home.
Let me make one last round.

404
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,399
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

405
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:03,797
My kid's admission
is being accepted again, right?

406
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,676
Plus a nice place near the school.

407
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,140
Also, take this.

408
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,226
What's this?

409
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,562
I looked at all of your stocks.

410
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,648
Get rid of everything you have now.

411
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:23,442
Revamp your portfolio.
I've listed it up for you.

412
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,820
It's my gift to you.
I'll let you know the selling timing.

413
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,590
How is it?

414
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:50,260
Well, the scenario is pretty stunning.

415
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:53,347
You sure this is okay?

416
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:57,559
What do you mean?

417
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,604
What about your son-in-law?

418
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,107
If Chef Hwang finds out, he will flip.

419
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,441
Ridiculous.

420
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,862
What about the sum I prepare
for his superiors and juniors?

421
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,823
Does it just fall from the sky?

422
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:16,120
Doing the filthy work is my due diligence.

423
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,831
Wow. How noble of you.

424
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,375
As expected of you.

425
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,253
I have much to learn from you in life.

426
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,425
We have enough ammunition.

427
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,971
Now you pick the A-level players,
who'll march on the front line.

428
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,472
You got it?

429
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:37,349
Of course.

430
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:42,229
I'm your right-hand man, no?
I will operate as ordered. Cheers.

431
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,400
Don't fool around and keep it sharp.

432
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,530
Short-sell these in full force.

433
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,991
-Strategy?
-Counterstrategy.

434
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,743
You sure about this?

435
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:59,246
Since you got cooped up in here,
the company is walking on thin ice.

436
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,290
Nothing's for sure.

437
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,626
Why are you anxious? This isn't like you.

438
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,756
The decision's based on my gut instinct,
not data or numbers.

439
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:13,135
If I were Chairman Myung,
what choice would I have made?

440
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,014
Then you are sure.

441
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,560
How's Tae-chun these days?

442
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,062
Tell him to come see me.
I need to talk to him.

443
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,816
He'd been out of reach for a while.

444
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,028
But a couple days ago,
he came to borrow money from me.

445
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:33,030
Money?

446
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,701
Re-raise five million.

447
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:40,037
-Damn it.
-Shit, I fold.

448
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,121
Call.

449
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,832
Who the hell is this guy?

450
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,542
Are you bluffing?

451
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,591
So it is Kim Seong-tae's gambling joint.

452
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:54,551
Also…

453
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,929
Look.

454
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,598
These shits might be dealing meth too.

455
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,600
This is Yoo Chang-hae, the smuggler.

456
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,684
PROFILE INFORMATION

457
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,729
I fold.

458
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:06,814
Sir.

459
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,483
What's up? Bathroom?

460
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,945
I have an emergency. Pardon me.

461
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,172
Sir.

462
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,175
-Okay, go again.
-Oh, man!

463
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,594
Okay, got it.

464
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:40,347
I'll take care of it.

465
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,106
Damn it.

466
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,492
Who the hell are you?

467
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,661
You have some business with me?

468
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,497
You don't look like a cop.

469
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,126
Then…

470
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,754
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun?

471
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,798
YOUNG PROSECUTOR'S VOLITION
UNCOVERS SCANDAL

472
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,217
You sent Seong-tae to prison.

473
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,555
You look better in person.

474
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,182
You're handsome.

475
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,144
Yes.

476
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,522
I am Prosecutor Jang
from Seoul District Prosecution.

477
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:39,484
Do you know what happens
when you assault a prosecutor in Korea?

478
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:46,199
Find that funny?

479
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,828
Where's Lee Jin-ho?

480
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,331
-Whoever speaks first will be--
-Yes, yes, of course.

481
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:57,377
Of course we wouldn't dare assault
a prosecutor in Korea.

482
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,049
We'll just bury you.

483
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,136
Boys, take care of Mr. Prosecutor.

484
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,263
-Yes, sir.
-Get him in the car.

485
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,974
-Oh, come on.
-Let go!

486
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,476
Guys, hold him tight!

487
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:14,811
-Come on.
-Let's go quietly.

488
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,564
-Let go!
-Hold him!

489
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,319
Let go! Let me go, you bastards!

490
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,529
-Get in, already.
-Let go!

491
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,074
Hey, hey!

492
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,658
Lights, lights!

493
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,118
The lights, lights!

494
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,245
What's going on?

495
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,291
What are you doing?

496
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,256
Thank you.

497
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,301
Are you Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun?

498
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,971
You know me too?

499
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,768
Detective Won, how are you here?

500
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,270
That's what I want to ask.

501
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:01,024
Are you determined to blow
our undercover investigation?

502
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:03,860
I just wanted Lee Jin-ho.

503
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:06,696
Don't you know how scary druggies are?

504
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,698
If you're not careful,

505
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:12,244
you could end up in a ditch,
and that would be the end of you!

506
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,789
Let's not overstep boundaries, okay?

507
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,335
The police in the field.
The prosecutors in court.

508
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,381
Sorry.

509
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,387
Are you hurt anywhere?

510
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,015
No, thanks to them.

511
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,731
Lee Jin-ho is a wanted man,
and we know he has access to drugs.

512
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,569
Leave this place to us.
You should get to the hospital.

513
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,696
What for?

514
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:52,284
Miss Park has regained consciousness.

515
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,286
Really?

516
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:55,954
Thank you.

517
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,892
Are you okay? When did you wake up?
Should you be out?

518
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,105
Joon-gyeong,

519
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,524
don't you know me?

520
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,320
Loss of memory-- is that what's happened?

521
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,408
You're asking too many questions at once.

522
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,119
Who-- Who am I?

523
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,456
Jang Tae-chun. Who else?

524
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,334
Thank goodness.

525
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,045
Oh, what a relief.

526
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:48,757
I'll drop the formalities
since I'm back from the dead.

527
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:54,221
But should you be out here like this?
Shouldn't you be resting?

528
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:57,724
You should get an IV
and do MRI scans and stuff.

529
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,061
I was bedridden for too long.

530
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,396
I wanted to get some fresh air.

531
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,653
Do you know how sorry I was?

532
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:15,909
I'm really okay now.

533
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,121
That's good to hear.

534
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,168
Did you talk to Uncle?

535
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,679
Inmate 4816, time to eat.

536
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,350
I'LL BE SEEING YOU

537
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,398
I'm alive.

538
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,858
See you soon.

539
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,539
It's bland.

540
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,083
Soups should be salty.

541
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,635
Inmate 4816, summoned to Prosecution.

542
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:12,192
The stocks you pointed out--
They're hitting the ceiling.

543
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,654
I was pretty amazed
when they first started going up.

544
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:21,201
But now that it's through the roof,
it's just scary.

545
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:25,747
When the market opens tomorrow,
sell everything and get out.

546
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,083
Already?

547
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,795
Everyone's saying it's staying up
until next week.

548
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,133
Understood, sir.

549
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:40,095
I'll do as you command, 4816, sir.

550
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,602
The real strategy begins now.

551
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,041
INCHEON DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

552
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,763
-How are you feeling?
-Fine.

553
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,851
-Let's go.
-Okay.

554
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,779
Yes?

555
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:44,951
Joon-gyeong!

556
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:48,997
Thank you.

557
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,290
Thank you.

558
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:51,916
Thank you.

559
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,587
Are you okay?

560
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,163
Glad you're okay.

561
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:47,514
Miss Hong and I,
we ran into each other at the hospital.

562
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:48,890
Mr. Jang, we haven't met.

563
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:53,811
Nice to meet you. I'm Ham Jin,
chief of Incheon Criminal Investigations.

564
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:56,898
Hello. I'm Jang Tae-chun,
40th class of the Bureau.

565
00:46:57,649 --> 00:47:00,485
It's an honor to meet you like this.

566
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:02,779
Gi-seok would love you.

567
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:08,284
Shall we begin the meeting?

568
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,538
Mr. Eun's research suggests,

569
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,791
Myung is still manipulating
the stock market with Bawoo Fund?

570
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,334
Yes, I'm certain.

571
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,670
-I've observed for 11 days--
-One moment.

572
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:21,631
-What?
-Before we discuss the details,

573
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,634
I'd like to know why you gathered us here.

574
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,847
Stock manipulation may seem complex,

575
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,560
but if you look closely,
the principle is quite simple:

576
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,896
Buy low, sell high.

577
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:42,944
Even so, most stock manipulations fail…

578
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,867
because it's hard to create
a team of reliable people.

579
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,496
To come up with a counterstrategy
against Myung,

580
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,958
we need a team
that's more reliable than his.

581
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,502
Those of you gathered here--

582
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,590
You're the "One Team,"
who will trust each other to the end.

583
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,720
Basically allies, okay?

584
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,474
-Let's get to work.
-Yes.

585
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:19,272
Omega Chemicals, Sum-jin Tech, Clay F&C.

586
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,565
These will take the hit

587
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:24,736
when Myung uses Bawoo Fund's capital
to manipulate its stock price.

588
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:30,033
Rumors have been going around in Yeouido,
hyping these companies up.

589
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:33,536
Simply put, the operation has commenced.

590
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,629
COURT OF JUSTICE

591
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,019
DEFENDANT

592
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,274
The defendant may give his statement.

593
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:05,818
Your Honor.

594
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:12,075
PROSECUTION

595
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,869
Before the trial begins,
I would like to dismiss…

596
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:18,247
my entire legal team.

597
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,751
-What?
-Dismiss the entire team?

598
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,378
Can he do that?

599
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,588
Has he lost his mind?

600
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,965
-Silence in the courtroom.
-What is he saying?

601
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,009
Silence in the courtroom!

602
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,305
Defendant, doing so won't delay the trial.

603
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,599
Yes, I am well aware.

604
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:39,102
-You're aware of the consequences?
-Yes.

605
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:42,438
Do you have a new attorney?

606
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,440
I do.

607
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:47,610
I'd like to appoint
Attorney Park Joon-gyeong.

608
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:30,695
Can he do this?

609
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,629
-Let's go.
-I'm out of here.

610
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:51,257
Damn it.

611
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:14,989
Your Honor,

612
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:20,161
to all accounts brought on
by the prosecution,

613
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,956
the defendant pleads not guilty.

614
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:38,471
-Park Joon-gyeong as his attorney?
-Yes.

615
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:42,892
So he wants a fight, huh?

616
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:47,688
Wait.

617
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,317
Are you Chief Hwang Gi-seok?

618
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,527
Yes.

619
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,986
Hello, sir.

620
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:58,908
Inmate 4816, Mr. Eun Yong
asked me to give this to you, sir.

621
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:02,662
Good day.

622
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,261
OMEGA CHEMICALS
SUM-JIN TECH

623
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:19,554
CLAY F&C

624
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,894
Chief? Chief?

625
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,354
What is it?

626
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:29,814
I'll call you later.

627
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,038
Gi-seok! What brings you here?

628
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:49,584
Omega Chemicals, Sum-jin Tech, Clay F&C.

629
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,460
Did you mess with their stock?

630
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,301
Guess you did.

631
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:02,972
Look, Gi-seok, I was just trying to
increase Bawoo Fund's rate of return--

632
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,765
Market manipulation, false disclosure,

633
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,143
failure to report Large Trader ID,
etcetera, etcetera.

634
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,937
Shall I arrest you now
for violating the Capital Markets Act?

635
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:13,608
What's wrong with you?
You think I did it for my own benefit?

636
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,192
Have you sold the stocks?

637
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:16,986
Why? What's happened?

638
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:21,282
The Incheon District is doing
a search and seizure on those companies.

639
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,575
What?

640
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:27,663
Nothing so far.

641
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:32,960
Okay, leave no corner left undusted.

642
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,256
Look inside their toilets too.
Search everywhere thoroughly.

643
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,592
Chief Ham began her search and seizure.

644
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,595
And the stock prices are falling
due to the bad news.

645
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:46,641
If Myung sells everything now,
he won't sustain a loss, right?

646
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:51,437
Except his ill-gotten gains will be proof
of his market-manipulation activities.

647
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:56,525
Burying investigations
is his son-in-law's specialty.

648
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,654
This time,
I don't think he'll do the same.

649
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:04,742
PROSECUTION SEARCH
OMEGA CHEMICALS

650
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,536
You were right.
I was planning to sell this afternoon,

651
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,121
but I must sell them off now!

652
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:12,083
No, no. Just don't do anything.

653
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,628
Gi-seok, if I miss the timing,
I lose everything.

654
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,421
I have to sell them now!

655
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:20,758
-The damn money isn't the issue here.
-"The damn money"?

656
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,760
Do you know what kind of money this is?

657
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:26,222
If we lose this, Bawoo Fund is finished!

658
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,976
Did you lay your hands
on Bawoo Fund's capital too?

659
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,310
That's right.

660
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:34,230
If we sell now, we'll be fine.

661
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,692
To hell with market manipulation.
To hell with investigations.

662
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,528
You and I,
we can just block them off, right?

663
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,458
Are you crazy?

664
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,212
If this goes sideways,
do you know how much we'll lose?

665
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:10,808
Do you…

666
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:16,480
This entire thing's by your design, no?

667
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,692
Why me? Why me!

668
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:24,363
Why do I need to wipe your ass every time?

669
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,491
Why, you little--

670
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,167
I don't care about Bawoo Fund.

671
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,045
You take care of it yourself,

672
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,338
Chairman Myung In-ju.

673
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:08,949
These men will be
your 24-hour security detail.

674
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,077
Special Forces, National Intelligence.

675
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,621
They're as skilled
as their résumés suggest.

676
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,542
Please stay here where it's safe
until the trial is over.

677
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:21,712
You don't have to go this far.
I'll be fine.

678
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:26,842
If you hadn't been lying unconscious
for a month, sure.

679
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:32,306
We've added the security clause
to our attorney-client contract.

680
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,643
You mean I have no choice?

681
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,898
Let me know if you need anything
and just focus on the trial.

682
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,525
We're counting on you.

683
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,200
I'm Choi Eung-gi.

684
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:54,537
If you ever need anything,
I'll be at your service.

685
00:56:56,914 --> 00:57:00,292
Will you do anything I ask?

686
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:01,877
That's right.

687
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:23,983
If you want to find Jin-ho, there are
drug dealers among Kim Seong-tae's boys.

688
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,443
If you look there, you'll find something.

689
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,028
Drugs?

690
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:32,700
Myung and Kim often used that method
to train the boys.

691
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,577
Jin-ho changed due to the drugs.

692
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,129
How can I help?

693
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,048
You said you have connections
in the police force?

694
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,134
Yes.

695
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:55,639
I need internal information
regarding the investigation of Lee Jin-ho.

696
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,016
Off the record.

697
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,185
Yes, ma'am.

698
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,863
Wow.

699
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,908
Great thing I took your advice
and sold the stocks, sir.

700
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,619
The stocks plummeted. Oh, there it is.

701
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:19,705
It's here, sir.

702
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,373
COURTROOM NO. 104

703
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:25,002
I'd love to continue this dynamic.
I'll be of good service to you.

704
00:58:55,491 --> 00:59:00,037
These past two weeks of analyzing
RSI and DMI's stock forecast

705
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:05,334
brings me to the following conclusion:
Myung will make his exit after three days.

706
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:09,880
According to analysts
and general market evaluations,

707
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:11,715
the stocks are expected to rise.

708
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,428
Their good publicity strategy enabled
the stock to rise to that effect.

709
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:21,016
But, since I know Myung so well,

710
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,727
his profit actualization date is…

711
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,231
indeed coming in three days.

712
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:32,903
So we prepare and strike
when Myung pockets his profits, right?

713
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,405
No.

714
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,117
The real strategy lies elsewhere.

715
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:44,081
Why did you inform me ahead of time?

716
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:52,339
It was your chance
to destroy the chairman.

717
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,011
Destroy the chairman by law?

718
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,598
You appointed Joon-gyeong
as your attorney.

719
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:04,393
Isn't it your way of saying
you want a legal fight?

720
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:09,815
Like you, I too don't believe in the law.

721
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:17,156
And you're telling that to a prosecutor?

722
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,701
What, then?

723
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:25,789
Let's make a deal.

724
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,256
A deal…

725
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,427
You have cards left to play?

726
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,891
I'll take all
of your father-in-law's wealth,

727
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,644
and give it to your wife.

728
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:56,111
If you make this deal with me,
I'll make the chairman…

729
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:00,407
kneel before you.

730
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,036
DEPUTY CHIEF LEE YEONG-JIN

731
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,663
I, Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun,

732
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,998
have been reinstated
to Criminal Division Five

733
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:51,834
following my disciplinary suspension.

734
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,252
Don't cause any trouble.

735
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,170
This is our first case as a unit,

736
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:57,172
and you want
to catch some securities firm guy?

737
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:01,969
-Next.
-Think wisely and tell me something useful

738
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,137
if you want to get out.

739
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,682
Or else, the pain will only continue.

740
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:11,478
All our investment funds have been frozen.

741
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:13,856
-Fucking--
-Sir!

742
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,566
Hey, Inmate 4816.

743
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,192
I'm serious.

744
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:19,820
Don't you want to work with me?
