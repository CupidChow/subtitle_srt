00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,706
ALL CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, CASES

2
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,958
AND SETTINGS DEPICTED
ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,961
It's good to see you back on your feet.

4
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,715
Congratulations on your nomination.
I'm sure you'll be elected.

5
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,550
Let's not celebrate just yet.

6
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,843
SON SEUNG-JIN
CANDIDATE NO. 2

7
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,678
It's a close game in this district.

8
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,054
I'll be by your side.

9
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,565
So you retrieved the flash drive
containing proof of evidence manipulation

10
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,775
by the prosecution?

11
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,193
Yes.

12
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:10,780
I'll bring it to light
right before the election.

13
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,867
No. Exposing it before the election
will only bring suspicions

14
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,620
of a political conspiracy.

15
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,332
It should be unraveled
in an orderly manner.

16
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,877
You should clear your mother's name
as soon as possible.

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,253
No.

18
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:30,549
If we don't remove all the higher-ups,
the truth will be covered up again.

19
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,843
The culprits will survive again.

20
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,597
You know proof isn't enough
to reveal the truth

21
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,766
in this era.

22
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,229
Dad sold that…

23
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,856
to you, Manager Eun?

24
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,651
You know how Chairman Myung is.

25
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,278
You know very well.

26
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,076
What will you do now?

27
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,787
Do as I say

28
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,791
if you want… to save your husband.

29
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,426
Aren't those outdated records?

30
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:17,304
We have new evidence.

31
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,849
I'm going back to square one.
Starting from scratch.

32
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,935
How is that new evidence?

33
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,523
The man in the photo...
Are you sure it's Hwang Gi-seok?

34
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,442
- What?
- They do look alike.

35
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,611
Can you identify him in court
definitively?

36
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,115
What do you mean?

37
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,535
In order to prove bribery,
the time of contact is crucial.

38
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:43,831
But is it really him
beyond a reasonable doubt?

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,501
Well,

40
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,171
I guess the defense counsel
could make that argument.

41
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,008
No. This is our argument.

42
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,968
Huh?

43
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:59,263
As a veteran inspector, I'm certain that…

44
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,142
this photo will not be admissible.

45
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,769
What? No way.

46
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:06,979
"No way"?

47
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,910
This is just an online photo that's
gone viral. It's legally inadmissible.

48
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:24,538
There's no telling that the man
is really Senior Chief Hwang.

49
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,665
"Unidentifiable" sounds just about right.

50
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:30,294
The press may blather on,
but they'll be filed for defamation.

51
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,756
But that's the defendant's argument.

52
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,592
- Not ours, right?
- Hey, you.

53
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,470
Prosecutors and lawyers are no different
before the law.

54
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,306
The principle of evidence.
You know of that, right?

55
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,683
If you handle evidence
like Prosecutor Jang,

56
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,477
you'll lose big-time in court.

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,229
- What I meant was...
- Prosecutor Jang has a point.

58
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,691
The public isn't on our side.
We can't make it too obvious.

59
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,487
If we go by the book,
the public will bash us.

60
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,199
It's our job to choose
which evidence is admissible.

61
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:04,328
Tell the reporters on our side that
we will investigate everything thoroughly

62
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,246
and to keep their mouths shut.

63
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,331
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,751
Our only focus now
is to capture Lee Su-dong,

65
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,712
now that we've bought some time
with Mr. Hwang's photo.

66
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,716
In the meantime, we'll catch Lee Su-dong
and wrap up the Bawoo Fund case.

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,468
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

68
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:41,281
<i>Your call cannot be completed as dialed.</font>
At the tone, please record your…</font></i>

69
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,708
Your guest has arrived.

70
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,169
Hello, sir.

71
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,677
The chairman of the board couldn't come
due to election preparations.

72
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,430
Instead, he wanted me to deliver
a message to you.

73
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,185
Sit.

74
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,105
Let's talk things through over dinner.

75
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,857
I have nothing to say.

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,570
I'll be going, then.

77
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,697
Where will you go?

78
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,536
You have nowhere to go
and no one left to call.

79
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,540
You're clever enough
to sense what's going on.

80
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,376
You're the cause of it all,
so what have you left to say?

81
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,547
You think I'm abandoning you?

82
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,302
Are you not?

83
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,846
Gosh, you prick.

84
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:49,099
Do you know how much money
I invested in you?

85
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,935
I only make investments
that turn a profit.

86
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,608
Come sit. Let's talk.

87
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,196
SON SEUNG-JIN
CANDIDATE NO. 2

88
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:07,910
My name is Eun Yong, a stock trader.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

89
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:11,580
Same here.
I've been wanting to meet you, Mr. Eun.

90
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,417
We were careful not to run into reporters.

91
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,379
Oh, I still have… some ongoing trials.

92
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,298
Oh, you've been targeted?

93
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,635
A target of prosecutorial misconduct.
I can relate.

94
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,387
I'm sorry for your hardship
during these rough times.

95
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,431
It's nothing.
Let me pour you a drink, sir.

96
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,641
- Sure.
- All right.

97
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,857
- Oh, please allow me.
- Thank you.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,568
Here.

99
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,321
Now that we've met,

100
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,157
let me be straightforward
and ask you something.

101
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,912
Why do you insist on helping me
despite my low electability chances?

102
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,961
Mr. Son, you fearlessly carry on
with what must be done.

103
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,963
And if you are elected,

104
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,966
there is a business
that requires your assistance.

105
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,843
I see.

106
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,804
I knew you'd have a reason.

107
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,932
If I want to be fearless as a politician,

108
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,476
corruption must be intolerable.

109
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,356
If you plan to bankroll my campaign
in exchange for a deal, I'll refuse.

110
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,777
The business that Yong is planning
is to reestablish Mom's company,

111
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,113
which has been delisted.

112
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,657
Why revive a company already in ruins?

113
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,326
I know getting revenge
won't bring back Mrs. Yoon,

114
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,245
who died an undeserving death,

115
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,707
but I wish for her entrepreneurial spirit

116
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,084
to live on.

117
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,920
It's going to cost you a lot.

118
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,718
But it's the best way
to use my earnings from money-making.

119
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,520
I guess I'll be seeing you
more often, then.

120
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,231
- Let's do it.
- Thank you, sir.

121
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,363
You've had your share of experience
as a prosecutor.

122
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,867
Don't waste your time
trying to become a politician.

123
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,287
Learn the money business from me.

124
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,917
From you?

125
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,214
Are you telling me…

126
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,052
to become a money-laundering lawyer
like Lee Su-dong?

127
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,596
Oh, Son…

128
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,601
Do you still think
you're in a position of power?

129
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,562
Say you become the attorney general
or the president.

130
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,190
You think it'll earn you power?

131
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,150
Are you telling me to live like you

132
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,320
so that I can grovel and wag my tail
at those with power?

133
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,614
You prick!

134
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,118
After everything, you still don't get it?

135
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,083
Money is real power.

136
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,590
I proved my power by bringing you down
with just a single blow,

137
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,259
even at your most powerful!

138
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,062
The powerful can't wield money.

139
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,441
But the rich can wield power.

140
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,162
Before you retire,
you should be where work is easier.

141
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,291
Prosecutor Jang's office
is quite eventful, right?

142
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,919
Not really. I'm not doing much these days.

143
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,965
Have you decided where to go
after your retirement?

144
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,176
Gosh, why do you ask?
Will you set me up somewhere nice?

145
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,180
A law firm named Choi and Jang
is looking for a legal adviser.

146
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,183
They are offering the senior position
with the highest salary.

147
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,354
- My goodness. I'll contact them, then.
- No.

148
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,315
You can tell me.

149
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,817
Excuse me?

150
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,904
If you want special treatment,
you'll need my recommendation letter.

151
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,824
I see.

152
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,077
Speaking of which,

153
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,497
I've been worried about Prosecutor Jang.

154
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,919
Since he puts his ambition
before our organization,

155
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,839
don't you think
he's not well-suited as a prosecutor?

156
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,135
Also, his uncle has a number of issues.

157
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,555
So what?

158
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,641
Please keep him under control
so he doesn't go overboard.

159
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:46,021
- And if he tries to do something funny...
- You want me to report to you?

160
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,356
Oh, my.

161
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,025
I knew we'd be on the same wavelength.

162
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:56,615
Regarding your position at Choi and Jang,
I'll make sure it's yours.

163
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,974
Are you really going to
read through all that?

164
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,019
I told you I'm going back to square one.

165
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,523
I'm not too bright,
but I'm made of patience and perseverance.

166
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,358
Gosh.

167
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,986
Why aren't you going home?

168
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,575
Let's just work late together.

169
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,536
All of a sudden?

170
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,623
My wife found out
I lost out on all my investments.

171
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,542
I've been walking on eggshells around her.

172
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,503
Gosh. If I had known,

173
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:55,382
I would've taken all the bribes
I was offered over the years.

174
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,678
Being a lone wolf only led me
to lose out on my severance pay.

175
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,180
It's not too late to start now.

176
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:06,935
I'm sure many law firms
will fight for your presence.

177
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,479
You think so?

178
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,984
- Choi and Jang gave me a generous offer.
- Wow! No way!

179
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,113
With that news,
your wife might actually forgive you.

180
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,076
I don't plan on accepting, though.

181
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,494
What? Why not?

182
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,831
I just don't click
with those kinds of guys.

183
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,749
Gosh.

184
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:34,087
I think if your wife finds out,
she might beat you to a pulp.

185
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,674
Man, what a waste.

186
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,347
I know it's a big waste of my competence.

187
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,641
- Prosecutor Jang.
- Yes?

188
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,814
Starting now, why don't we conduct
a real special investigation?

189
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,525
Seriously?

190
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,696
I'd be grateful if you'd be willing.

191
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,533
A special investigation
is all about the flow.

192
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,454
{\an8}At this point, It's not about catching
Hwang. The key is to catch this guy.

193
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,541
I want to catch him too. But how?

194
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,710
He's on the wanted list.

195
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,796
The police are searching
every nook and cranny to no avail.

196
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,673
The key is to follow the money.

197
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,928
Especially guys like this.
You follow the money, you find them.

198
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,805
Money?

199
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,727
{\an8}LEE SU-DONG

200
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:50,038
- I'll come pick you up at 9:00 a.m., sir.
- Sure. Let me pay…

201
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,252
Take… Take this.

202
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,170
It's all right, sir.

203
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,769
- Thanks.
- Did you drink with Dad?

204
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,442
But why is Mr. Kim coming to pick you up?

205
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,659
I am…

206
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,454
working with your father now.

207
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,125
What?

208
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,335
Why would you…

209
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,714
work with my dad?

210
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,480
Because the one with money
is the one with power.

211
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,616
<i>Manager Eun.</font></i>

212
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,161
Aren't you the one who desperately wanted
to bring down my husband?

213
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,290
So how am I supposed to believe
that you'll save him?

214
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:20,211
Your husband's already ruined.
What's the point of killing him twice?

215
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,798
With that flash drive,
I intend to incriminate everyone.

216
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:27,218
Those who worked with the chairman
in the manipulation case...

217
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,429
I'm wiping them out.

218
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,349
You mean…

219
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:37,145
you intend to destroy everyone around me?

220
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,398
The chairman's money
doesn't satisfy you, right?

221
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,235
Even though your loan-shark father
became filthy rich,

222
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,988
you knew early on
that money wouldn't satisfy you.

223
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:50,033
You wanted your husband to fill that void.

224
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,703
Cooperate with me.

225
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,208
It's the only way
your husband will get a second chance.

226
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,718
What is this?

227
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,845
Rat poison.

228
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,872
Gosh, are you feeling okay?
Have some of this.

229
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,042
Goodness. I'm not okay.
How much did I drink yesterday?

230
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,254
My gosh. You were chugging it down.

231
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,715
I'm surprised you're up so early.

232
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:50,927
Riding horses in the clean Mongolian air
rides up your alcohol tolerance.

233
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,972
- So you drink like a horse?
- What a lame joke!

234
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,563
It's refreshing. It's good.

235
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,239
Why? What's wrong?

236
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,367
Myung's daughter will cooperate with us.

237
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,703
Really?

238
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,214
Sailfin sandfish is in season now,
so it's full of eggs.

239
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,592
The fish is from your hometown, Sokcho.

240
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,428
I mean, all the dishes look delicious.

241
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,972
But this one over here...
This one is the real deal.

242
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,849
Let's give it a try.

243
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:47,567
It has just the right amount of spice
and tastes just like home. This is great.

244
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,986
I'm glad you like it.

245
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,365
You must be going through a lot
because of Gi-seok.

246
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,285
I understand
why you invited me for a treat.

247
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,165
If he just weathers this storm,
everything will work out, so don't worry.

248
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,543
I'll trust you, then.

249
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:09,130
Of course. Please do.
We're basically family.

250
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,467
Thank you.

251
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,428
Enjoy your food
and let me know if you want more.

252
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,222
Okay. This is great.

253
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,024
Yes, Mr. Kim.

254
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,319
I have the documents my dad left.

255
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,201
Yes. The one inside
the Singapore bank envelope.

256
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,205
Okay. Come pick it up when you can.

257
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,835
- Director.
- Yes?

258
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,088
Your wife likes our soybean paste, right?
I'll pack you some.

259
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,298
Gosh, that sounds fantastic.

260
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,133
Please excuse me, then.

261
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,376

<i>The envelope contains profit details</font>
from short trading, right?</font></i>

263
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,717
Do you think he'll move as you expect?

264
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,677
He'll think Myung pocketed big

265
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,263
by short selling
amidst the Bawoo Fund crisis.

266
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,017
He won't let Myung have it all alone.

267
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,812
Right. They won't investigate
Chairman Myung and his illegal shorting.

268
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:52,150
Seeing the figures will make him greedy.
It's a battle of greed against greed.

269
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,740
Myung will be in a pickle soon.

270
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,492
Let's eat.

271
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:09,500
What do you mean by that, all of a sudden?
You're imposing a travel ban on me?

272
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,669
While our economy was collapsing,

You think I wouldn't find out
if it's overseas?

275
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:20,303
Didn't I show you my bank account
at the prosecution?

276
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,180
You think I stashed money overseas?

<i>Singapore. Somewhere in that country.</font></i>

278

Goodness. All right.
I understand what you mean, sir.

280
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,444
Okay. I'll visit you
and bring a presentable gift, sir.

281
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,822
So please,

Sons of bitches who tempt

DEPOSIT 35 MILLION WON

310
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,763
- This is the retainer fee.
- That's how it's been recorded.

311
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,058
But the retainer fee
had been wired at 3:00 a.m.

312
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,811
Oh, that is strange indeed.

313
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,648
I'm certain that this is
Lee Su-dong's gambling money.

314
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:40,985
Look here. The next day,
the money was withdrawn.

315
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,488
It's plausible.

316
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,615
How did you see this?

317
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,242
When I was young,

318
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:51,079
my mom had a knack
for getting gamblers to pay their tabs.

319
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,332
She taught you well.

320
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,171
There's only one kind of relationship
between a man and woman

321
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,881
involving money sent at this hour.

322
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,219
So it's not his client, but his mistress.

323
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,387
Bingo.

324
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,056
I'll get a warrant for this.

325
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:14,268
Her bank-account or credit-card records
might help us track down Lee.

326
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,772
You are such a quick learner.

327
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,400
But something crucial is wrong.

328
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,403
Whose approval do you need for a warrant?

329
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,697
Obviously, our chief...

330
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,954
If we share this with Chief Lee
or the Bawoo Fund task force,

331
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,580
we might lose Lee forever.

332
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,002
I do know a chief
who'll approve my warrant.

333
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,422
INVESTIGATION REPORT
ILLEGAL TRADING OF BAWOO FUND

334
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,306
Why would you report this to me?

335
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,896
I want to capture Lee Su-dong alive.
We can't let him be forced into suicide.

336
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,693
Did your uncle send you to me
to collect my debt I owe him?

337
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,781
No, ma'am.
I'm not working with him anymore.

338
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,242
Why not?

339
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,452
I'm a prosecutor.

340
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,372
The process has to be just
as well as the result.

341
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,332
Is that so?

342
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:24,297
But coming to me to get your warrant
is also a form of cheating, right?

343
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,093
Well, I mean,

344
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,804
that's true.

345
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,808
These kinds of moves aren't illegal
or deceitful.

346
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,060
They are a technique.

347
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,062
An investigation technique.

348
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:45,318
If you need anything kept confidential,
feel free to come to me.

349
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,653
Yes, ma'am. Salute.

350
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,171
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm sorry, sir.</font></i>

351
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,341
<i>I'm preparing for a meeting</font>
with the Supreme Office, so I can't go.</font></i>

352
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,010
Then you should've told me in advance.

353
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,512
Don't you know I care most
about being punctual?

354
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:19,894
Damn it.

355
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,109
Are you reporting to the attorney general?
He likes summaries.

356
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:30,238
- Summarize first, then elaborate.
- <i>Thank you for the advice.</font></i>

357
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:34,492
By the way,
did you find anything on Lee Su-dong?

358
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,247
Why would you ask me that
when I'm still wait-listed?

359
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,916
Aren't you working
with your father-in-law now?

360
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:46,045
<i>I hear Myung ordered his guys</font>
to look for Lee.</font></i>

361
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,881
- Really?
- <i>Please look into it.</font></i>

362
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,384
The higher-ups are pestering me.

363
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:55,137
I get it.
I asked you to meet me today because...

364
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,766
<i>Mr. Hwang, I'm busy right now,</font>
so please text me instead.</font></i>

365
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:03,229
- No. I can't tell you this over text.
- <i>I'll call you after the meeting.</font></i>

366
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,856
<i>Please hurry up and look into Lee.</font></i>

367
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,650
Yeong-jin…

368
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,037
He's a clever one,

369
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,207
so I'm sure he got the message by now.

370
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,959
But still,

371
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:29,213
if you neglect Mr. Hwang like this,
those loyal to him will be disheartened.

372
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,466
"Those loyal to him"? You mean yourself?

373
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,304
Gosh, can you not read the room?

374
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,181
My goodness.

375
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,144
Power cannot have dry spells.

376
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,605
Soon you'll be promoted to chief.

377
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,859
You can continue Gi-seok's job
without a hitch, right?

378
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,280
This is how you grab a chance.

379
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,217
What are you doing?

380
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,178
Oh, you're home.

381
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:21,432
It's been a while since I've cooked,
so I can't vouch for anything.

382
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,145
Sit here.

383
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:40,659
What's wrong?

384
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,037
You don't like it?

385
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,122
Do you think…

386
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:49,126
you can stay married to me?

387
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:51,921
What?

388
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:56,050
Every time you see me,
you'll be reminded of my dad.

389
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,637
The person who crushed your dream.

390
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,350
Don't worry.

391
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,268
I won't go down that easily.

392
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,146
Eat before it gets cold.

393
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,735
Why don't you work with Manager Eun
instead of my dad?

394
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,372
I met with Manager Eun.

395
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:30,292
He has a plan of his own,
and he wants to meet you.

396
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,380
The two of you
may not have ended things well,

397
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,299
but you liked him
when you cooperated with him.

398
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:47,059
Manager Eun is
a much more suitable partner than...

399
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,655
I can't eat this.

400
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,579
It was my choice

401
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,998
to work with your dad.

402
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,584
I know. But...

403
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,878
It's my business, not yours.

404
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,172
I wish you wouldn't act out
like the others.

405
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,053
I have enough on my plate,
kissing up to those idiots.

406
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,778
Yesterday's meeting
with Minister Son went well.

407
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,031
He decided to support us.

408
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,076
{\an8}The Indian client's WTI futures
keep dropping.

409
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,417
I'm all for funding
Minister Son's political campaign.

410
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,295
He seems like a politician
worth investing in.

411
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,631
But…

412
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:02,885
you seriously going to pour all your money
into rebuilding a dead company?

413
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:07,097
Mrs. Yoon's company
was based on a solid foundation.

414
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,311
In the long run,
this investment is worth it.

415
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:16,148
In the short term,
the rate of return was 4.76%.

416
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:17,942
Exactly.

417
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,571
Your forte is in short-term profits.
So why suddenly play the long game?

418
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,865
You think it's easy
to rebuild a delisted company?

419
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,369
I can bring in money
by day trading like this.

420
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:30,788
Fine.

421
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,875
Let's assume you relist and invest
in the company with your own money.

422
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:39,797
But re-listing depends greatly on
the sustainability of the business item.

423
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,175
What business item does GMI Bank have?

424
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,053
Stock manipulation?

425
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,388
Then I'm in.

426
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,224
But do you think
you can revive the company?

427
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:53,352
It's not GMI Bank I'm reviving.

428
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,687
It's Bluenet.

429
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,899
That's why Joon-gyeong went to meet him.

430
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:00,859
Who?

431
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:06,907
The youngest developer of Bluenet,
their last director of development. Okay?

432
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,004
After Mrs. Yoon passed away,

433
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:24,758
was the loan shark who took over
the company Myung In-ju?

434
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,013
Ever since Bluenet changed its name
to GMI Bank,

435
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:34,184
all of the developers there got kicked out
without any severance pay.

436
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:38,772
I will pay what's overdue
once the company is back on its feet.

437
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,776
If you need more developers,
we can always reinstate them.

438
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,863
The new investor

439
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,449
must be rich.

440
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,079
If you spearhead
the development team again,

441
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,206
we have the budget and resources
necessary...

442
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,459
Money doesn't matter anymore.

443
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,670
The chipset technology
we developed back then.

444
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:05,466
Last year, an American company completed
and registered a SEP.

445
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,012
Meaning, it's not ours to develop.

446
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,056
I'm aware of that.

447
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:17,728
But what we're trying to revive
isn't the company's name but its spirit.

448
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,105
What we need right now
isn't innovative technology,

449
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,191
but a true passion for development.

450
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,612
How refreshing.

451
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,531
Persuading developers with sincerity

452
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,618
is uncommon nowadays.

453
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,459
I have three more minutes to spare,

454
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,462
but if you're finished,
I'd like to stand up.

455
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:58,477
This is the last business plan
my mother wrote while behind bars.

456
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:03,857
If you still have a few minutes to spare,
please take a look.

457
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,161
Thank you for your precious time.

458
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,725
How did it go with Dr. Cha?

459
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,101
He won't budge.

460
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:45,274
- Do we need another developer?
- I'll keep trying until he budges.

461
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:49,111
My mom chose him herself,
so I want to give it my best with him.

462
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,451
Why? Do you want another developer?

463
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,412
No. I'll leave that up to you.

464
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,291
Then what's with the look?

465
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:04,877
It's nice.

466
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,171
What is?

467
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:12,259
It's nice to see you think about something
other than trying to get revenge.

468
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:18,891
What's that?

469
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,852
This is a popular game in Mongolia.

470
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,022
It helps you clear your head. Come here.

471
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,150
- It looks like chess.
- Right. It's similar.

472
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,820
This is the bishop, right?

473
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,951
- Oh, you know how to play?
- I know how to play chess.

474
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:43,791
This piece is like the knight in chess.

475
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,504
How's Prosecutor Jang doing these days?

476
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,923
Working late every day.

477
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,467
Like a chess pawn,

478
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,970
he is advancing little by little.

479
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,055
Your turn.

480
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,812
The knight, huh?

481
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,606
She sure ain't going easy.

482
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,487
Wow. Look at her monthly spending
at department stores.

483
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,113
CREDIT CARD RECORDS

484
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,954
Prosecutor Jang, goodbye.

485
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,580
I'll be going home now.

486
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,040
All right. Bye.

487
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:32,005
Oh, Yun-ju. Prosecutor Jang and I
will be out tomorrow morning.

488
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,715
- Okay.
- See you.

489
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,760
Where are we going tomorrow?

490
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,429
Lee Su-dong's mistress

491
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:42,140
has been receiving hundreds of millions
from a company in London.

492
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,601
We're going to London, then?

493
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,188
Gosh, that's just a paper company.

494
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,359
It turns out the company is renting
an office in Cheongdam.

495
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,865
I see. I found something too.

496
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:03,453
His mistress went shopping every day
using his credit card, spending a ton.

497
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:07,666
But after Lee's escape,
she hasn't spent a dime.

498
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:12,087
You mean he's with his mistress right now?

499
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,173
Perhaps tomorrow, we may bump into him
in Cheongdam.

500
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,258
Yes!

501
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,869

00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,951
Damn bastard.

508
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,666
Look here, you prick!

509
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,001
Why am I still banned from traveling?

510
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,127
What?

511
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:38,048
I gave Chief Lee a call last night.

512
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,467
Goodness, Gi-seok.

513
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,845
You still think you're the senior chief?

514
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,223
A phone call won't do shit!

515
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:50,519
You drink with the heavy drinkers
and golf with the golfers!

516
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,605
You have to butter them up

517
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,857
in order to get what you want!

518
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,276
Yes, sir.

519
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,405
Any updates on Lee Su-dong?

520
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,824
What Chief Lee needs
is information on him.

521
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,618
The traps are in place,

522
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,830
so we'll have him in a few days.

523
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:15,085
But whether he comes back
dead or alive all depends on him.

524
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,465
I'll get going.

525
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,801
All right, Gi-seok.

526
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,304
Get your act together, okay?

527
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,778
Damn it.

528
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,254
Hold on.

529
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,425
If Lee is actually here,
can the two of us take him?

530
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:06,887
- I'll call the cops and ask...
- Come on.

531
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:12,100
I can take care of that lanky prick alone.
It's not like he can jump off of here.

532
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:15,604
All you need to do is to guard this door
and nothing else, okay?

533
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:23,987
<i>Who is it?</font></i>

534
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,532
I'm from maintenance.
Could you please come out for a minute?

535
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,330
Maintenance? What's wrong?

536
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,874
Well, sir…

537
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,876
We're busy, so come back later.

538
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,089
Should I call the cops?

539
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:44,966
Damn it.

540
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,640
You brought handcuffs?

541
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,898
Didn't I fucking tell you
to come back later?

542
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:03,735
I'm Investigator Nam Sang-il.
Get out of our way or get handcuffed.

543
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:22,212
The guys from earlier...
Myung sent them, didn't he?

544
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,135
So you weren't able
to go to the department store

545
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,803
because you were held hostage?

546
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,351
If you file charges,
you can put them behind bars,

547
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,103
and the police will protect you.

548
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,438
It's fine. I know them well.

549
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:46,403
Goodness. Have you been in touch
with Lee Su-dong recently?

550
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,780
I told those guys the same thing earlier.

551
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:52,492
He gave me an email address
to use in emergencies.

552
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:35,160
Why would you meet me
at a place like this?

553
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,953
We could've had dinner instead.

554
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:40,373
Our office isn't doing so great,
so I should be careful.

555
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,042
I see.

556
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,754
Did you get the file
on the director of inspections?

557
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:49,925
If I'm correct,
back when he was at the north office,

558
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,177
he covered up for a tax officer.

559
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,221
Mr. Hwang.

560
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:57,724
What? You didn't bring it?

561
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,685
You know I'm your right-hand man, right?

562
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:03,980
Of course I know.

563
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,899
I don't know about anyone else,

564
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,276
but I'll take care of you.

565
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,694
How will you do that?

566
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,865
- What?
- The seniors from the Supreme Office

567
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,077
all know that I am your right-hand man.

568
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,040
So if you keep demanding things like this,
you're putting me in hot water.

569
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,585
I'll continue to respect you
as a former senior,

570
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:28,213
so don't go around causing problems.

571
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:29,881
Yeong-jin.

572
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:32,509
Did you…

573
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,267
Did you just tell me
not to cause problems?

574
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,102
You…

575
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,522
are not a prosecutor anymore.

576
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:49,943
If you decided to support your prosecutor
friends with Myung's resources,

577
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,861
then start by helping me out.

578
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:55,615
I need to secure my position
so that you'll reap the benefits.

579
00:42:56,408 --> 00:43:00,328
Also, keep the chairman under control.

580
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,416
Please do me a favor, Mr. Hwang.

Are you eating okay?

587
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,719
I'm still alive, unlike the rest of them,
so I guess I'm all right.

588
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,725
Turn yourself in.
I'll make sure you'll be protected under...

<i>On one condition.</font></i>

00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,192
What is it? I'll do anything in my power...

591
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,111
<i>Tell your uncle about me…</font></i>

592
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,281
and ask to get me to a safe country.

593
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,451
<i>Then I'll testify on video.</font></i>

594
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,330
- Let me know when everything is ready.
- <i>Mr. Lee.</font></i>

595
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,541
There are other ways we can protect...

596
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,585
Damn it.

597
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,175
What will you do?

598
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,143
The date of the press conference
has been confirmed, as planned.

599
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,603
All right. Great job.

600
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,024
Hold on.

601
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,237
I'll call you back.

602
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,335
My wife told me…

603
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,005
that you have a plan.

604
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,526
This is what you want, right?

605
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:08,201
Lee Su-dong's condition
is to ensure a safe passage abroad?

606
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:10,119
Then we should help him.

607
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:12,247
Sorry?

608
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,415
We'll set up a fake stowaway route

609
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,960
and capture him
while he's testifying on video.

610
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,547
A sting won't be easy to pull off.
He's quick and sly.

611
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,675
We have investigators here
at the Incheon district

612
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,260
who are veterans at that stuff.

613
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,638
To make it look like Uncle's work,
whatever the price,

614
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,848
we need to plan
a fast and efficient route.

615
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,476
Okay. I'll look into
the most expensive route.

616
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,645
We don't know where Lee
will want to meet us,

617
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,939
so we need support
to arrest him at the scene.

618
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,567
I'll select some reliable investigators.

619
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,651
Thank you.

620
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,112
This time, we'll capture him.

621
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,787
ONGOING CONSTRUCTION
NOV '07, 2014 UNTIL COMPLETION

622
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,721
- All ready?
- Yes, sir. This way.

623
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,959
FOR LEASE

624
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:28,883
Gosh.

625
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:30,927
Everything is ready.

626
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:34,013
We still have about 30 minutes.

627
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,267
Lee Su-dong will show up, right?

628
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,478
Let's wait and see.

629
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,109
Have you seen Attorney Park recently?

630
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:49,070
No.

631
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,822
I don't contact her either.

632
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:57,203
There's a rumor the opposing party
will expose a prosecution corruption case.

633
00:49:57,286 --> 00:50:00,331
I think it's related to the Bluenet case.

634
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,626
Revealing evidence may do nothing.

635
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,254
It might even backfire,
since it's election season.

636
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,756
They'll figure it out.

637
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,384
We'll handle what's on our plate.

638
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,219
Sure.

639
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,610
Have you arrived?

640
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,154
SON SEUNG-JIN
PRESS CONFERENCE

641
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,030
Yeah. I arrived safely today.

642
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,450
Okay.

643
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:39,162
Everything's all set over there?

644
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,873
Yeah, no issues here.
Everything's perfect.

645
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,334
He's waiting for you.

646
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,420
He's here. I'll call you later.

647
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,088
Okay.

648
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,015
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

649
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,614
Manager Eun!

650
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,657
Gosh! Manager Eun.

651
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,368
My goodness.

652
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:20,787
Gosh.

653
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,122
I can't believe I'm seeing you alive.

654
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,043
It's so great to see you.

655
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,836
It must've been tough for you.

656
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:33,174
Yeah, I almost died.

657
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,610
THIS IS EUN YONG. CALL ME.

658
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:03,830
It's not the most comfortable place,
but I can assure you it's the safest.

659
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,040
Of course. Everything's fine.

660
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:09,377
Being safe is all I need.

661
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:13,297
Gosh. Thanks to you,

662
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:16,634
I'll finally be able to relax
and get some sleep.

663
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:17,927
This is great.

664
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,640
If you need anything else,
tell the security team.

665
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,643
Oh, am I allowed to do that?

666
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:27,937
I see.

667
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,023
I'll make requests
if I think of something.

668
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:34,527
Manager Eun.

669
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:39,073
Thank you so much.
I don't know how I'll ever repay you.

670
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:45,204
Just keep your promise.

671
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:47,665
Of course.

672
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,877
Don't worry about that.
I'm an eloquent speaker.

673
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,796
I'll give it my best.

674
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,922
Sure.

675
00:52:56,007 --> 00:53:00,344
By the way, did something happen
between you and Prosecutor Jang?

676
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:02,221
Why are you working separately?

677
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:05,182
Tae-chun is no longer…

678
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:08,311
on my side.

679
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:11,439
Oh, really?

680
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,443
I see.

681
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,322
- Rest up, then.
- All right.

682
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:35,713
Prosecutor Jang.

683
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:38,341
There's been a leak.

684
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,385
- What? Who's the rat?
- Assistant Park Yun-ju from our office.

685
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,234
Apparently, she handed her resignation
just now over the phone.

686
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,486
Hold on.

687
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:01,572
We have her travel records.

688
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:03,491
INCHEON - AUSTRALIA

689
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:08,245
She left for Australia early this morning
with an immigration visa.

690
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,123
- Fuck.
- Damn it.

691
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,627
SON SEUNG-JIN
PRESS CONFERENCE

692
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,128
Greetings.

693
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:20,424
My name is Son Seung-jin,
the congressional candidate of Buksan.

694
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:24,136
I'd like to hold this press conference

695
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,430
to reveal the prosecution's
past unlawful practices

696
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:29,183
of prosecutorial misconduct.

697
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:33,896
The late CEO Yoon fought
to reveal the truth until her last breath.

698
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,193
Her daughter is here with us today.
Please welcome Attorney Park Joon-gyeong.

699
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:47,910
My name is Park Joon-gyeong.

700
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:53,666
This flash drive contains
the original copy of the ledger I rigged

701
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,668
and sent to Prosecution.

702
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:04,260
As I said before, the co-conspirator
who ordered me to manipulate the ledger

703
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,387
is Prosecutor Hwang Gi-seok.

704
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:10,808
<i>Furthermore, we have invited</font>
an insider who can testify to the truth</font></i>

705
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,560
<i>more accurately than anyone.</font></i>

{\an8}PROSECUTOR HWANG GI-SEOK
AT PRESS CONFERENCE

707
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:34,373
SON SEUNG-JIN PRESS CONFERENCE

708
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,189
My name is Hwang Gi-seok.

709
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,108
<i>First of all…</font></i>

710
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:02,485
PROSECUTOR HWANG REVEALS TRUTH

711
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:03,861
<i>…before I reveal the truth…</font></i>

712
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,202
I express my sincerest apologies
and deepest regrets

713
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,664
to the late CEO Yoon…

714
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,293
for the immense suffering

715
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,213
Prosecution may have caused her.

716
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,173
Goodness.

717
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,301
Wow.

718
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,571
{\an8}WHISTLE-BLOWER HWANG GI-SEOK
OFFERS "DEEPEST APOLOGIES"

719
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:50,491
He must be out of his fucking mind!

720
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:10,052
<i>To follow up,</font>
Attorney Lee Su-dong will testify</font></i>

721
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:13,222
<i>as the key witness in this case.</font></i>

722
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,101
<i>Hello. My name is Lee Su-dong.</font></i>

723
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,562
<i>To reveal the truth of this photo,</font></i>

724
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,816
<i>Prosecutor Hwang Gi-seok was only present</font>
for a moment at the time.</font></i>

725
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,860
Wow.

726
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:29,113
<i>The crux of the meeting began</font>
after Hwang Gi-seok left.</font></i>

727
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,364
You didn't know?

728
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,284
<i>Chairman Myung of Bawoo Fund</font>
continued the meeting…</font></i>

729
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,785
You had no idea.

730
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,413
<i>…with Director of Inspections Nam Jae-wook</font>
and others.</font></i>

731
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,706
You couldn't have known.

732
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,584
<i>I believe this photo was distributed</font></i>

733
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:46,005
<i>by forces who colluded</font>
against Prosecutor Hwang Gi-seok.</font></i>

734
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:47,840
<i>Currently,</font></i>

735
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,344
<i>the only prosecutor I can trust</font>
is Hwang Gi-seok.</font></i>

736
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:55,472
If he takes charge of this case,

737
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:57,683
I will turn myself in.

738
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,238
<i>I'll do as you say.</font></i>

739
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,991
I'll become your dog.

740
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,868
I'll bark upon your command,

741
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,120
and I'll bite when you wish.

742
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,126
I knew you were clever.

743
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,421
But if I do as you say…

744
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,176
what will I get in return?

745
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:39,975
If you obey my orders,

746
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:43,312
I'll make sure you recover

747
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:45,898
everything you have lost.

748
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:59,370
You're the one who snatched Lee Su-dong?

749
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:02,706
I thought we weren't going to talk
about that.

750
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:07,294
What's your plan?
Hwang Gi-seok as the whistle-blower?

751
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,339
You're really planning to work with him?

752
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:12,549
I already told you.

753
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,178
I need a prosecutor
who'll fight to the end.

754
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:20,683
I will fight to the end.
Not on your terms but with law and order...

755
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:22,434
You can't win with that.

756
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,440
So how much progress did you make?

757
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:35,406
You couldn't even capture Lee Su-dong.

758
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:39,743
You're right.

759
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,539
You're the one who paid off
my assistant, right?

760
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:46,333
Her whole family emigrated,
leaving not a trace.

761
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:48,377
And it screams you.

762
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:51,547
You have proof?

763
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,145
What's your plan when you can't win
an easy battle like this?

764
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:09,023
Justice without intellect

765
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,817
is utterly useless.

766
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,497
From this point on…

767
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:30,044
I will atone for my past actions.

768
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,298
Starting with my family,
to my predecessors,

769
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:38,135
I will investigate everyone
without concession.

770
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,430
I, Hwang Gi-seok,

771
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:43,849
as a whistle-blower myself,

772
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:48,562
will fight to establish
an upright and honorable Prosecution…

773
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,149
until the very end.

774
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,550
I will use Hwang Gi-seok

775
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,303
to wipe out everyone.

776
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:11,061
Why did you lie?
