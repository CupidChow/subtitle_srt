PARK HOON
KIM HONG-PA

5
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,004
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, CASES,

6
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,004
AND THE SETTINGS OF THE PROSECUTION
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

7
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:45,342
The search and seizure is over.

8
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:49,930
Investigations are about

9
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:52,099
painting the bigger picture.

10
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:53,475
That's the essence of it.

11
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,687
I'm in a dilemma between two scenarios.

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,815
You want me to cooperate
with finding Myung's assets

13
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:01,692
and settle at the right time…

14
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:04,653
or go against you and get destroyed.

15
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:05,738
Wow.

16
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:09,116
You really are sharp. What a shame.

17
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,243
Have a drink.

18
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:17,750
You raided my office, yet you're offering
a drink instead of handcuffs.

19
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:20,043
You want to cut a deal with me.

20
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:25,382
You afraid of me?

21
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:32,723
You avoid the powerful
and treat the weak harshly.

22
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,768
Like Joon-gyeong said in the past,

23
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:40,564
you're not a righteous prosecutor
who fights for the greater good.

24
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:45,152
You merely sell your trade
for power and advancement.

25
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:49,782
So righteous prosecutors are those
who recklessly fight for justice,

26
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:52,159
while those who make realistic decisions

27
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:55,078
to arbitrate accordingly
are in it for their advancement?

28
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:57,623
Realistically speaking,

29
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:01,877
do reckless fights achieve justice?

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,171
You must also learn when to let it go.

31
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,799
You and Park Joon-gyeong,

32
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:09,802
you both want excessive justice.

33
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:13,472
The concept of justice is black and white.
What's this "excessive justice"?

34
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:18,060
You said to tie them all down
so you could wipe out the top brass.

35
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:20,646
But think about it.

36
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,065
Everyone has a skeleton in their closet.

37
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,026
As a matter of fact,

38
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:29,404
in order to maintain law and order,

39
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:33,784
we elites must not lose our sense
of balance to keep the society…

40
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,619
Sense of balance, my ass.

41
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:40,707
You just got scared and backed out,
you idiot.

42
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:51,802
I promised to help you recover
everything you lost.

43
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,973
Hence, I helped pull you up
from rock bottom.

44
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,100
Guess you got scared

45
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:02,646
that you might hit rock bottom again
if you kept working with me.

46
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:07,234
They call you Chef Hwang
not because you uphold law and order,

47
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:11,697
but because you cook cases
just to satisfy the top brass' taste.

48
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,367
You only know how to be petted
by your owner for being an obedient dog.

49
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:18,245
You've never actually conducted

50
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:21,623
a real investigation before, have you?

51
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,876
Okay.

52
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,295
I'll do it right this time.

53
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:30,132
A taste of excessive justice
for you and your friends. Happy?

54
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:35,888
Is that all you can do with the power
that I've gotten back for you?

55
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:39,641
Pocketing Myung's dirty money
and bullying my friends?

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,895
Wow.

57
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,689
I can't believe how pathetic you are.

58
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:50,819
"Pathetic"?

59
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:54,948
How brazen of you to say that
in this situation.

60
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:59,703
If you cooperate well enough,
I'll lift your travel ban.

61
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,497
So leave when you can.

62
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:04,666
No.

63
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,668
I won't leave.

64
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:12,883
I've settled and left the country before,
which I deeply regret.

65
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,136
Let's fight this time.

66
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,430
Until the end.

67
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,862
The trap has been set,

68
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:36,490
but what do you think?

69
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:38,200
Well, I'm not sure yet.

70
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:41,870
He is quite sly too.

71
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,418
Hwang Gi-seok raided your uncle.

72
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,838
I heard he went to the penthouse himself.

73
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:56,301
Damn, seriously. I knew this would happen.

74
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:58,345
Sounds just like Hwang.

75
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:01,890
When he sets his heart on a kill,
he doesn't pull any punches.

76
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:05,852
He goes straight into the center
and stabs the heart.

77
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,647
Not the heart, but my uncle's back.

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,790
As of now, build a case linking Eun Yong
and his fund to all his connections.

79
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:28,291
Focus on his previous charge

80
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,378
regarding Oh's suicide
and tie anything you find to that.

81
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:34,589
Anyone who ever spoke with him
or looked him in the eye--

82
00:05:34,673 --> 00:05:38,343
No. Anyone who breathed the same air
with him is guilty. Got it?

83
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:40,804
Shake them all down.

84
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:43,765
If you find fault, blow it up.

85
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,809
If you find nothing, improvise.

86
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:49,104
Understood?

87
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:50,397
Yes, sir!

88
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:53,775
We arrested Hong Han-nah.
What should we do with her?

89
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:57,404
Get her a warrant
as the co-conspirator of CEO Oh's death.

90
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,531
Freeze the fund's capital too.

91
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:06,830
Take me into custody?

92
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,794
Gosh, thanks to Eun Yong,
I'll get to visit jail.

93
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:16,381
I'll file a writ of habeas corpus
as soon as I can.

94
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:20,093
-What about the fund?
-All funds are frozen.

95
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:24,014
-Trading will be banned starting tomorrow.
-Damn it!

96
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,266
What the…

97
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:31,813
I guess the Mongolia Project
is down the drain.

98
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:36,568
I plugged away for a long time,
investing big on that project.

99
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:43,450
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,744
Why would you be sorry?

101
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,542
Forget it.

102
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,128
Don't worry about the money.

103
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,797
After all,

104
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,508
I am indebted to Eun Yong.

105
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:02,385
When I was living in the States,

106
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,180
I got conned
and even lost my parents' house.

107
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:07,933
But Yong got it back for me.

108
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:11,436
When I was at my lowest,
he was foolish enough

109
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,356
to fight until the end for me.

110
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,358
I'll always be thankful.

111
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:24,908
Sounds similar to your story
with him, right?

112
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,958
Tell Yong not to worry about me

113
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,669
and make sure he gets everything he wants.

114
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:38,630
I'll do that.

115
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:47,013
They even arrested Han-nah.

116
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:50,267
I'll submit the habeas corpus petition
and release her on bail.

117
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,227
Take good care of her.

118
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,564
She's strong,
but she's never been through this.

119
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:59,317
Tell her I'm sorry and to hang in here.

120
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,986
Okay.

121
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,530
But your funds are frozen,
so it might be hard.

122
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:05,031
<i>I expected that to happen.</i>

123
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:06,741
No need to worry.

124
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,161
What about the Mongolia Project?

125
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:12,247
<i>That's not important right now.</i>
<i>Did Han-nah tell you to ask?</i>

126
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:17,252
I'll handle it,
so tell her to take care of herself.

127
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,130
I'll stay with her
until she gets transferred.

128
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:23,216
We shouldn't let our guards down.

129
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:26,344
All right. I'm counting on you.

130
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:37,189
We don't have solid proof.

131
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:40,942
But Ms. Kim Bok-sun's statement

132
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:44,154
and the dashcam footage
of Chief Lee at Eastern District--

133
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:47,115
These two are indisputable facts.

134
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:52,787
So, what we need to know is where Myung
went after his visit to Eastern District.

135
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,878
-This is where CEO Oh died, right?
-Yes.

136
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:04,883
I checked the building and the nearby
CCTVs, but nothing came up.

137
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:09,554
By the way, I found something odd
about Oh's suicide note.

138
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,225
-What's wrong with the note?
-On the list of evidence we have,

139
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:16,228
fingerprint identification results
from Forensics aren't on here.

140
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:17,562
Huh? That can't be.

141
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:21,149
Checking prints on the note
is protocol for suicide cases.

142
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:22,692
Right, but it's missing.

143
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:23,777
Hold on.

144
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,245
The prosecutor in charge was…

145
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:38,208
Chief Lee Yeong-jin?

146
00:09:42,545 --> 00:09:44,589
EXAMINATION OF EVIDENCE
LEE YEONG-JIN

147
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,304
BLUENET CEO YOON HYE-RIN

148
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:53,515
SENIOR CHIEF HWANG GI-SEOK
MYUNG SE-HUI

149
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:00,772
Oh, you're here.

150
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:07,279
Organized everything already?

151
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:11,741
Hwang may have taken my ledger,
but the numbers are in my head anyway.

152
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,077
He can't confiscate that from you,

153
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,663
so he'll try to arrest you
to keep you silent.

154
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,582
From where Hwang stands,
he wants me to accept his offer

155
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,918
and disappear at the right time.

156
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:25,297
If he doesn't get his way,
he'll find any dirt he can on my staff,

157
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,634
their families and friends,
just like he did to Han-nah.

158
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,805
Just like he did to my mom.

159
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:39,352
Out of those involved in my mom's death…

160
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:45,483
Hwang had Myung
and Prosecution's top brass arrested.

161
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:47,110
Now…

162
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,614
the only one left is Hwang Gi-seok.

163
00:10:58,038 --> 00:10:59,998
Transaction history
with a Singaporean fund.

164
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:02,959
-You found this on Eun Yong's computer?
-Yes, sir.

165
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,879
It's the record of illegal trading
using the profit he gained

166
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,881
just before the Bawoo Fund case.

167
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:12,135
This serves as conclusive proof
of his connection to the fund--

168
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:13,303
Leave this one out.

169
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,430
Sorry?

170
00:11:15,513 --> 00:11:17,599
We can't use this as evidence.

171
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,310
Well, but…

172
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:25,857
the other ledgers seem to be encrypted,
so we can't crack them.

173
00:11:26,441 --> 00:11:28,109
-Encrypted?
-Yes, sir.

174
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:31,488
I heard it's what loan sharks
used to do in the past.

175
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:37,160
-The computer we confiscated--
-Yes, sir.

176
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:39,746
We won't be able to use it as evidence.

177
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:44,501
Exclude it from the evidence list
but bring me the computer.

178
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,005
Sir.

179
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:52,175
That's a bit…

180
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:57,931
Right. Gosh, now that I think about it,

181
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:03,353
you've risked everything for this case,
but I haven't done anything for you.

182
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:07,399
The promotion season's next month?

183
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:12,028
If you join Special Investigations
as head prosecutor,

184
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:13,488
you'll be in the fast lane.

185
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:16,199
Prosecutors need a breakaway like this.

186
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:18,618
You're not getting any younger.

187
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:21,121
So?

188
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:25,041
Do you think you can prepare
the evidence list again?

189
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:29,337
Yes, sir.

190
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:32,632
I'll do so thoroughly
and resubmit the report.

191
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:35,969
Okay. I'll just pretend I never saw this.

192
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:37,053
Yes, sir.

193
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:52,527
As to why you went to Eastern District,

194
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,196
you still don't remember?

195
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:04,164
CEO Oh died
the night you visited Eastern District.

196
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,669
But the fingerprint identification results
of his suicide note went missing

197
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:13,465
while being transferred to Prosecution.

198
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:20,096
The prosecutor in charge
and the one who omitted evidence

199
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:22,515
was you, Chief Lee.

200
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:28,313
EXAMINATION OF EVIDENCE
LEE YEONG-JIN

201
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:31,232
Hey, Prosecutor Jang.

202
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:33,067
Yes.

203
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:37,322
You bring me a piece of paper and photo.

204
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:41,284
-Think you can keep this up with that?
-However long it takes,

205
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,454
I won't stop until I catch the murderer.

206
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:49,834
If perhaps there were co-conspirators,
I won't stop until I catch them all.

207
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:59,636
You must've gotten too used to
fabricating investigations.

208
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,721
But aren't investigations

209
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:05,183
about following the trail of evidence?

210
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:11,231
Ms. Hong Han-nah.

211
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:15,818
Your retired parents in Jeju
are quite worried about you.

212
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:20,365
The subject of your blackmailing
committed suicide.

213
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:22,408
You'll be sentenced heavily for that.

214
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:24,327
If you wish to clear your name…

215
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:28,665
think carefully before you answer.

216
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,085
Think about your parents.

217
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:46,057
Hey, Eun Yong. You okay?

218
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,226
I heard Hwang stabbed you in the back.

219
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:49,394
Goodness.

220
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:53,856
I mean, I toss and turn all night
worrying about you.

221
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,569
Myung took everything from me
and almost had me killed.

222
00:14:57,652 --> 00:15:00,071
But I made it out alive, thanks to you.

223
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:03,074
Still, I couldn't be of much help,

224
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:08,121
and it's not like I have anything now.

225
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:11,916
You'll get the land you were promised.
I'll send over the documents.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,210
Sign them and send it over.

227
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,631
My goodness.
I'm not doing this for the money.

228
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:21,593
You know I've always liked you.

229
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:26,014
People like me are good at reading others.

230
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:29,434
You're the one and only person
in this field

231
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:33,271
who beat Chairman Myung at his own game.

232
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,650
How's he doing these days?

233
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:40,361
That old goat is still up and going.

234
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:45,116
It's not like this place
can make him turn over a new leaf.

235
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:48,995
It's time to finally put an end to this.

236
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,627
Let's do an operation
while you're in here.

237
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,088
What kind of operation?

238
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:05,094
Didn't we decide to go our separate ways?

239
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,096
Saving your uncle comes first.

240
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:14,646
Only if we stay within legal boundaries.

241
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,818
What's this?

242
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:25,948
The copy of Yong's illegal activities
and his confession statement.

243
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:28,826
RECORD OF STATEMENT
EUN YONG

244
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,747
Just before the Bawoo Fund incident,
Yong used information he got from Myung

245
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,333
and ran a short sale through his fund.

246
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:39,212
The evidence and statement proves he
illegally wired the profit to Singapore.

247
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:41,756
It also includes
his statement on Chief Lee

248
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,550
sneaking him out from prison
to meet Myung at his villa.

249
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:49,430
It's key evidence that can prove
Chief Lee's charges.

250
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:55,144
-And the original copy?
-Hwang Gi-seok confiscated it.

251
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:00,900
Initially, the shorting profit
was transferred to Myung,

252
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:03,695
but now Hwang has the money.

253
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,990
And Hwang will try to destroy
the evidence.

254
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:12,662
If we request a warrant on those grounds,
we can prevent that from happening.

255
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:16,749
Prosecutor Jang,

256
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:19,293
can you do this?

257
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:22,422
Well,

258
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:25,007
doesn't seem illegal in any way.

259
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:28,052
You're up against Hwang.

260
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:34,851
Is Eun Yong's computer taken care of?

261
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:38,980
-I'll finish up over the weekend.
-Gosh, you're better than Yeong-jin.

262
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:41,983
Hello, Senior Chief.

263
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:46,821
What brings you here?

264
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:48,990
I was reinvestigating a case.

265
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:51,284
I need a piece of evidence
you confiscated.

266
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:00,334
-A search-and-seizure warrant?
-Yes.

267
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,628
May I execute it, sir?

268
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:05,256
-Your uncle must've sent you.
-Excuse me?

269
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:09,469
The computer I took from him yesterday--
He wants you to retrieve it.

270
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:15,725
If it went through Forensics anyway,
the task force should have a copy, no?

271
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:17,977
If you're not tampering with evidence,

272
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,814
you should have no problem
handing over the original hard drive.

273
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,241
Senior Chief, the meeting is ready.

274
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:33,826
Okay.

275
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,710
I heard you've summoned
Chief Lee frequently.

276
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,089
He's helping out with our investigation,
so take it easy.

277
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:50,259
Prosecutor Jang, what'll you do?

278
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:53,304
We are investigating your uncle's fund.

279
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:58,100
Do you want to go behind bars
while running errands for your uncle?

280
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:01,979
Or do you want to rejoin my task force?

281
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:09,654
I'll be executing the search and seizure.

282
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:11,948
<i>Tae-chun is…</i>

283
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,408
<i>no longer my weakness.</i>

284
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:27,547
<i>He's the most powerful weapon I have</i>
<i>to end this fight.</i>

285
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,764
Prosecutor Jang retrieved
the original copy.

286
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:39,433
Okay. So we have our evidence.

287
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:41,853
How did your meeting go?

288
00:19:41,936 --> 00:19:43,938
He'll make a move tonight.

289
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:48,943
Myung must be enraged.

290
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:53,155
He spent his whole life earning
his cherished money.

291
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:56,659
Now he's lost everything
to his daughter and son-in-law.

292
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:59,871
No. He'll try to find a way to come back.

293
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:02,206
Our beloved chairman…

294
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,751
doesn't give up so easily.

295
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:11,674
MYUNG IN-JU
ARRESTED

296
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:15,511
Goodness.

297
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,349
There is nothing else I want.

298
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:23,019
I will give you everything I have

299
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:26,898
to you and Gi-seok.

300
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:32,361
So help me serve my time peacefully
in a hospital.

301
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:36,240
Isn't it too late for that?

302
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:41,120
I hear my husband
already found your money.

303
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:44,582
What's truly valuable is still hidden.

304
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,887
There are lots of eyes on my villa.

305
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:02,391
When I hosted a party at my villa…

306
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,983
You really have that?

307
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:13,152
Where?

308
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:19,492
No one can find it except me.

309
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:22,787
With that, my son-in-law

310
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:26,707
will have no problem entering
the political world.

311
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:31,003
If you can get me into a hospital,

312
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:33,214
I'll find it for you.

313
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:40,304
I'll discuss it with Gi-seok.

314
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,140
All right. Please do that.

315
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:53,859
I hear Jang's been harassing you.

316
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:57,989
Don't worry about it. He'll be gone soon.

317
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:03,494
You are well aware what happens
to those who go against me.

318
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,876
-Yeong-jin.
-Yes, sir.

319
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:15,589
Make sure you testify well, all right?

320
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:21,762
-I'm counting on you.
-Yes, sir.

321
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,141
Drink up.

322
00:22:35,943 --> 00:22:39,196
Before CEO Oh's death, you visited
the Supreme Office with Eun Yong

323
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,865
for a fund presentation, correct?

324
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:44,326
The prosecutors present at the time
have all testified.

325
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,997
If you don't want to become an accomplice,
tell me the truth--

326
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,167
Prosecutor, how much do you make a month?

327
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,585
What?

328
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:58,340
I can't believe people like you get paid
with the tax I pay to this country.

329
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,968
Ms. Hong Han-nah.

330
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:03,554
There's enough evidence and testimony.

331
00:23:03,637 --> 00:23:06,140
Getting all worked up
won't lead you anywhere.

332
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:09,769
And pleading the Fifth
won't do you any good either.

333
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:13,939
Add the illegal shorting
from Eun Yong's computer as evidence.

334
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:15,900
Jang took the original anyway.

335
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:17,735
Yes, sir.

336
00:23:17,818 --> 00:23:20,529
How pathetic of you
to let him take it back.

337
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:21,947
Don't you think?

338
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,701
-I'm sorry, sir.
-If you want to make up for it,

339
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:30,081
work with Lee and come up with a story
for Jang Tae-chun.

340
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:33,542
Can you handle that?

341
00:23:35,252 --> 00:23:36,462
Yes, sir.

342
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:57,775
Aren't we going to Prosecutor Jang?

343
00:23:57,858 --> 00:24:00,861
Sure. Wait here a second.

344
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:12,456
Long time no see.

345
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:23,509
What brings you here?

346
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:27,471
It looks like we've switched places.

347
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:35,604
Do you remember the night
you sneaked me out to meet Myung?

348
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:38,065
<i>You summoned me to Prosecution,</i>

349
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:39,817
<i>changed my clothes,</i>

350
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,487
<i>and arranged a rendezvous</i>
<i>with Myung at his villa.</i>

351
00:24:44,572 --> 00:24:48,909
My statement and proof are
in Prosecutor Jang's hands now, but…

352
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,248
I'm well aware of Hwang's cooking skills,

353
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:58,127
so you must be thinking
it can be cooked to your advantage.

354
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:02,506
But what if I tell the press?

355
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:10,931
Hwang Gi-seok has power
in his hands again.

356
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:15,019
The soon-to-be district chief,
who dreams of higher places.

357
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:18,439
But here you are,
taking the fall for his sins.

358
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,650
Do you think he'll keep you alive?

359
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:34,371
You know how Oh Chang-hyeon
and Kim Seong-tae died, don't you?

360
00:25:38,918 --> 00:25:41,045
As to what kind of person Hwang is…

361
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:45,299
you know better than anyone.

362
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,552
Am I wrong?

363
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:00,981
Gosh, it's delicious.

364
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:08,781
Se-hui, put your dad on the phone.

365
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:09,865
<i>Hold on.</i>

366
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,288
Hello?

367
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:18,082
It's Gi-seok.

368
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:20,459
Did you get some sleep?

369
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:22,336
Gosh, my son-in-law.

370
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,673
Thanks to you, I had a good night's sleep.

371
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:31,387
Se-hui made me soup for breakfast,
so I'm eating up now.

372
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,680
Sounds great.

373
00:26:33,555 --> 00:26:36,058
-You'll get it in the morning, right?
-<i>Of course.</i>

374
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:37,893
I'll find it and bring it to you.

375
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:41,397
Be discreet so no one sees you.

376
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,815
No worries.

377
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:46,026
I'll go quietly and retrieve just that.

378
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:48,696
-Put Se-hui back on.
<i>-Sure.</i>

379
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,281
Don't skip your meals.

380
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,616
Here.

381
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:55,869
Hello?

382
00:26:56,537 --> 00:26:58,080
Just listen, don't answer.

383
00:26:58,706 --> 00:27:02,042
I told them to move your father
to an isolation ward.

384
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:04,795
<i>Take good care of him.</i>

385
00:27:04,878 --> 00:27:06,588
Okay. Understood.

386
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:28,861
Hey, Chief Lee.

387
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:40,331
You hear about Myung's medical parole?

388
00:27:41,582 --> 00:27:45,252
-I think Hwang pulled some strings.
-I heard.

389
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:52,092
One moment,
they're at each other's throats,

390
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:56,180
but now, Hwang has his back?

391
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,766
Doesn't that seem fishy?

392
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:02,811
Did you not hear anything from Hwang?

393
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,486
My goodness. I guess not.

394
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:16,533
Hey.

395
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:20,412
Since Hwang has your back for now,

396
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,207
you think you're safe, huh?

397
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:26,710
But don't trust those shits.

398
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:31,340
When the Bawoo Fund incident blew up,

399
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:33,550
I was the first one
they threw under the bus.

400
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:35,511
You remember, right?

401
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:37,554
Man.

402
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:41,517
Just stay safe.

403
00:28:43,227 --> 00:28:45,020
You should protect yourself.

404
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:47,147
You only get one life.

405
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:50,484
I'll get going.

406
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:01,912
HOSPITAL

407
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:09,545
Chairman Myung!

408
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:11,463
It's been a while.

409
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:18,095
What's this?

410
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:26,603
I'm going to go get some air
with Eun Yong.

411
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:27,980
I'll take care of him.

412
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:29,982
If you're thinking about
calling the cops--

413
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:31,859
Right, you can't.

414
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:35,654
The hospital surveillance cameras
just caught you sneaking him out.

415
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:39,199
Dad, are you nuts?

416
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:41,577
What are you doing with him?

417
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,870
What do you think?

418
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:45,247
He's going to give me money.

419
00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:49,084
You still trust him after everything?

420
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:50,419
Of course.

421
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:53,881
He paid me hundreds of billions
to get proof on CEO Yoon's death.

422
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:57,759
This lunatic here
cares about nothing but revenge.

423
00:29:57,843 --> 00:29:59,678
-Let's get going.
-All right.

424
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:01,889
Tell your husband I'll see him soon.

425
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:24,578
Okay.

426
00:30:24,661 --> 00:30:27,164
Anything useful from Hong Han-nah?

427
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:29,958
She's holding up her argument
on Eun Yong's innocence, but--

428
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:33,128
Summon her parents and begin a tax audit
on her dad's company.

429
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,254
Yes, sir.

430
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:36,256
What about Bluenet's rehabilitation?

431
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,511
Attorney Park applied for it, but she's
following proper legal procedures, so…

432
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,931
Find a damaged investor
who's willing to cooperate.

433
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:45,807
-Tell them to sue her.
-Yes, sir.

434
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:47,893
The new developers of Bluenet?

435
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:51,438
The technology isn't popular
in stock manipulation--

436
00:30:51,522 --> 00:30:53,899
The director is Dr. Cha Dong-jin, right?

437
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,402
He held the same role in his prior job,
so make up a story

438
00:30:58,237 --> 00:30:59,947
about leaking corporate secrets.

439
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,114
Yes, sir.

440
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:04,660
As for Prosecutor Jang, re-paint him
as Chief Lee's co-conspirator.

441
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:05,827
Sorry?

442
00:31:08,372 --> 00:31:09,456
Chief Lee will testify.

443
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:15,170
Prosecutor Jang alone won't do.
We need a chief prosecutor in the picture.

444
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:17,130
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

445
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:20,425
We finally have our outline.

446
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:28,183
EUN YONG

447
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,902
Yes, Se-hui. How did it go?

448
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:41,154
Dad ran away with Eun Yong.

449
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:43,323
What?

450
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:52,207
<i>Let's do an operation</i>
<i>while you are in here.</i>

451
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,376
What kind of operation?

452
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:55,669
Tell Chairman Myung

453
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:58,589
I want to make a deal with him.

454
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,342
And intimidate Chief Lee.

455
00:32:03,677 --> 00:32:08,181
Myung's completely broke and useless now.
What business have you with him?

456
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:12,269
I have one left.

457
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:27,576
I heard you got a reprieve
to stay at the hospital, Chairman.

458
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,661
But you look as healthy as ever.

459
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,708
Chief Ham. The air outside feels so nice.

460
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:40,297
Attorney Park Joon-gyeong
will be my counsel, right?

461
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:45,552
-She's as beautiful as her late mother.
-Be quiet and take a seat.

462
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,431
Are we starting already? Sure. Why not?

463
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:02,944
Let us begin the interrogation
of witness Myung In-ju,

464
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:05,822
with Attorney Park Joon-gyeong
representing him.

465
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:07,699
For security reasons,

466
00:33:07,783 --> 00:33:10,994
we will proceed in a private venue
instead of the hospital.

467
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:13,538
I understand.

468
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,043
<i>Hwang stated his penance</i>
<i>at the press conference.</i>

469
00:33:18,752 --> 00:33:21,672
But regarding the case
that drove my mom to her death,

470
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:24,424
he never confessed to his sins.

471
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:27,260
To make him pay for his sins,

472
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,430
we need to start by revealing the truth.

473
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:35,977
Myung's blood is boiling
from losing all his money.

474
00:33:37,104 --> 00:33:41,149
If it's about ruining Hwang,
we'll have Myung's full cooperation.

475
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:42,359
He'll testify.

476
00:33:45,821 --> 00:33:50,200
I saw my son-in-law, Hwang Gi-seok,
write a memo to Minister Son's assistant.

477
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:52,536
"Fifty million for Bluenet's Yoon.

478
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,871
Bring it to me."

479
00:33:55,831 --> 00:33:58,166
I saw it with my own eyes.

480
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:03,088
You're saying he struck a secret deal
in front of you, Mr. Myung In-ju?

481
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:05,841
It happened during a party at my villa.

482
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:08,510
I even paid the secretary

483
00:34:09,386 --> 00:34:12,055
five big ones to take it back.

484
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:21,565
Senior Chief, we must act quickly.

485
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:25,026
We'll trace the vehicle
and ask for police support.

486
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,987
Hey, Investigator Kim.

487
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,198
Are you trying to tell the world
a key suspect and my wife

488
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:32,492
illegally sneaked out of the hospital?

489
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,619
Haul in all the investigators!

490
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:40,083
And locate Eun Yong's whereabouts. Got it?

491
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,753
Yes, sir.

492
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:51,678
Asshole, I told you not to call
if it's not urgent!

493
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:55,891
<i>Sir, that's not it.</i>
<i>Eun Yong's requested to visit you, sir.</i>

494
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:07,611
PROSECUTION SERVICE

495
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:31,092
Where's the chairman?

496
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:37,140
Should I tell you here? You sure?
There are eyes and ears.

497
00:35:37,224 --> 00:35:38,391
You little fucker--

498
00:35:38,892 --> 00:35:41,561
Why don't we go to your office
for a nice, quiet chat?

499
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:47,984
After Myung finishes testifying
about Mrs. Yoon's case,

500
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:50,570
that'll be my signal…

501
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,365
to start the real game.

502
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:01,915
What do you want?

503
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:08,755
You want me to release Hong Han-nah
and unfreeze your funds?

504
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:11,466
I'm not you.

505
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,468
We've come too far for that.

506
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:15,387
Then what?

507
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,225
I've only wanted one thing from you
since the beginning:

508
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:22,686
for you to pay

509
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:24,980
for your sins.

510
00:36:26,398 --> 00:36:28,108
There are tons of prosecutors here.

511
00:36:28,692 --> 00:36:31,862
Call any of them and fess up
before Myung spills it all.

512
00:36:33,572 --> 00:36:35,365
This is your last chance.

513
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:46,084
Prisoner's dilemma.

514
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,419
Is that your game?

515
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:52,215
You have us in separate rooms,
offering freedom to whomever blows first?

516
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:54,301
But look.

517
00:36:55,594 --> 00:36:59,180
The statement you obtained
for helping his illegal escape--

518
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,267
You think it'll be admissible in court?

519
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,145
What do you mean? This is legal.

520
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:07,731
Chairman Myung is testifying

521
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:10,483
to Chief Ham Jin right now.

522
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,611
What?

523
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,613
Check if you don't believe me.

524
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:26,124
Put the Incheon district on the line.

525
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,504
Hurry the fuck up!

526
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:35,342
<i>While I was dealing with Hwang Gi-seok,</i>

527
00:37:35,842 --> 00:37:39,638
<i>Joon-gyeong updated Tae-chun</i>
<i>on the current situation.</i>

528
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:44,100
Mr. Nam, did you receive the video I sent?

529
00:37:44,184 --> 00:37:47,062
Yes. Prosecutor Jang is showing it
to Chief Lee right now.

530
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:59,991
<i>Lee Yeong-jin provided</i>
<i>the copy of the note.</i>

531
00:38:00,784 --> 00:38:04,496
<i>He summoned and arrested CEO Yoon</i>
<i>using the fabricated evidence.</i>

532
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:07,248
<i>That's how the rigged investigation began.</i>

533
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:10,752
<i>Lee Yeong-jin is Hwang's right-hand man.</i>

534
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:13,046
<i>He'd do anything for him.</i>

535
00:38:20,762 --> 00:38:22,847
I rummaged through the evidence room

536
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:25,308
and found latent print results.

537
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:30,730
No latent prints have been discovered
on the suicide note.

538
00:38:32,524 --> 00:38:33,733
How strange.

539
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:39,280
It's only normal for it to have
CEO Oh's prints on it, no?

540
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,493
You tampering with evidence
that may prove a murder,

541
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:46,705
along with Myung's testimony.

542
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:50,166
Once this is revealed to the press,

543
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:54,546
what do you think Hwang Gi-seok will do?

544
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:01,386
<i>You know how Oh Chang-hyeon</i>
<i>and Kim Seong-tae died, don't you?</i>

545
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:07,684
As to what kind of person Hwang is…

546
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:11,938
<i>you know better than anyone.</i>

547
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:15,525
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

548
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:20,030
You are well aware of what happens
to those who go against me.

549
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:32,000
Chief.

550
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,048
I'll ask you one last time.

551
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,344
Why did you visit
Eastern District that night?

552
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,022
I don't care what Myung testifies to.

553
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:56,524
After all, he's just a criminal.

554
00:39:57,233 --> 00:40:01,279
He's only making up stories
to get back at his prosecutor son-in-law.

555
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:03,281
His confession?

556
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:07,077
I'm telling you, it's completely useless.

557
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:14,375
You bastard. How dare you come in here!

558
00:40:16,086 --> 00:40:17,837
Senior Chief Hwang Gi-seok.

559
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:20,799
Chief Lee Yeong-jin just confessed.

560
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:27,806
Confess what?

561
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:32,060
Prisoner's dilemma is only valid
between prisoners.

562
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:35,438
Between prisoners Myung and Lee,

563
00:40:35,522 --> 00:40:37,690
Chief Lee got the edge, no?

564
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:40,318
<i>On the day of CEO Oh's death,</i>

565
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:43,613
<i>did you order Chief Lee</i>
<i>to help Chairman Myung</i>

566
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,699
<i>leave Eastern District</i>
<i>unbeknownst to others?</i>

567
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:01,798
Yes. I just sent over Lee's statement.

568
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:07,554
My goodness.

569
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:10,223
<i>Lee Yeong-jin confessed?</i>

570
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:15,979
Will Chairman Myung also receive
Chief Lee's statement, Prosecutor Jang?

571
00:41:18,857 --> 00:41:20,650
I don't know about his other sins,

572
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:24,154
but he'll definitely confess
to murdering CEO Oh.

573
00:41:25,822 --> 00:41:30,076
Look back on your actions and think
carefully about why this is happening.

574
00:41:50,555 --> 00:41:55,476
A moment ago, Chief Lee Yeong-jin
admitted his involvement…

575
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:58,104
STATEMENT
LEE YEONG-JIN

576
00:41:58,188 --> 00:42:00,982
…in conspiring to murder CEO Oh.

577
00:42:04,944 --> 00:42:08,698
Mr. Myung In-ju, you may plead the Fifth,

578
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:11,576
but I'll ask one more time:

579
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:15,997
Did you conspire with Hwang
to murder CEO Oh Chang-hyeon?

580
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,419
This question wasn't part of our deal.

581
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:24,797
What about the money?

582
00:42:25,632 --> 00:42:29,093
Was it all for show
to lead me into this trap?

583
00:42:32,513 --> 00:42:35,516
Chief Ham,
may I have a moment with my client?

584
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:37,393
Of course.

585
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:49,948
Mr. Myung In-ju,

586
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:52,951
confess before it's too late.

587
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,496
Don't add to your crimes
by making needless comments.

588
00:42:58,248 --> 00:43:01,042
I wonder what the second prisoner
decided to do.

589
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:04,254
His co-conspirator would know.

590
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:12,178
I have nothing more to lose.

591
00:43:12,804 --> 00:43:14,555
I just don't care anymore.

592
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:18,601
If you confess and cooperate
with the investigation,

593
00:43:19,227 --> 00:43:22,897
I will offer you a plea deal
so you may avoid the maximum sentence.

594
00:43:22,981 --> 00:43:26,234
What did you say? "Maximum sentence"?

595
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:29,862
If you decide to keep silent,
even after Lee's confession,

596
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,949
I can assure you one thing:

597
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:36,077
You'll never get to see any money.

598
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:41,165
Hwang Gi-seok also knows
of Lee's confession.

599
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,669
The moment he confesses before you,

600
00:43:45,753 --> 00:43:49,132
you should forget about any plea deal.

601
00:43:52,427 --> 00:43:56,055
Think about the countless financial crimes
and murders you've committed.

602
00:43:56,889 --> 00:43:59,392
The hottest fire will rain upon you.

603
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:04,814
This is your last chance.

604
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,526
Confess your crimes.

605
00:44:11,612 --> 00:44:15,867
If not, you'll live out
the rest of your life in regret.

606
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:25,460
Prosecutor Jang.

607
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:32,759
Chairman Myung confessed.

608
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,261
Mr. Hwang Gi-seok,

609
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:39,974
you are under arrest as the co-conspirator
of Oh Chang-hyeon's murder.

610
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:42,643
No warrant needed.
He might destroy evidence.

611
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:44,896
You have the right to an attorney

612
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,607
and to state your case.

613
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:52,362
You may apply the writ of habeas corpus
to review the legality of your arrest.

614
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:53,863
Let's go.

615
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:55,156
I've waited for this.

616
00:44:59,118 --> 00:45:02,455
Mr. Myung In-ju,
you have the right to an attorney

617
00:45:02,538 --> 00:45:04,415
to state your case

618
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:07,919
and to petition the court
to review the legality of your arrest.

619
00:45:25,478 --> 00:45:27,397
You think this can bring me down?

620
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:31,025
You think the people who obeyed
under your power

621
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:34,362
will stay obedient
after seeing you like this?

622
00:46:14,735 --> 00:46:16,946
-Hey!
-Hey, CEO Eun!

623
00:46:17,697 --> 00:46:19,490
Hey, come here.

624
00:46:20,825 --> 00:46:22,577
You okay? You injured anywhere?

625
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,537
Man, this is nothing.

626
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,789
You must've been worried sick!

627
00:46:26,873 --> 00:46:30,084
I was worried a little.
Just a little. Very little!

628
00:46:30,168 --> 00:46:31,586
He was very worried.

629
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:35,465
My gosh. My cutie. Yong.
How was it without me?

630
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:38,009
-You did well.
-Did you even eat while I was gone?

631
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:39,760
Did she have tofu?

632
00:46:40,386 --> 00:46:43,848
I saw so much tofu at your house.
You should've-- Come here.

633
00:46:53,232 --> 00:46:54,984
You idiot.

634
00:46:57,111 --> 00:46:58,905
You wanted my money that badly?

635
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:05,161
I took you in when you were nothing,
but you're just as greedy as your dad.

636
00:47:07,121 --> 00:47:10,208
I spent my own money
to get you to where you are now.

637
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:17,548
You're the one who made me like this.

638
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,177
Every time you called,

639
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:24,972
you asked for favors
and to clean up your mess…

640
00:47:27,183 --> 00:47:30,186
What do you mean?
I'm the one who got my hands dirty.

641
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:33,481
I was doing it for my family.

642
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:38,236
It's a family business.

643
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:41,113
You said I was your dog.

644
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:45,576
A bitch that guards your money.

645
00:47:50,206 --> 00:47:51,624
You call that family?

646
00:47:57,922 --> 00:48:00,091
Listen. It's gotten late today,

647
00:48:00,174 --> 00:48:03,219
so have a good night's sleep in jail,
and see you tomorrow.

648
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:08,057
Take care of your son-in-law, okay?
It's his first time in jail.

649
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,600
What did you say? You…

650
00:48:22,905 --> 00:48:27,285
The encrypted data on your computer
was a list of Myung's hidden assets?

651
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:31,622
How did you find my computer password?

652
00:48:31,706 --> 00:48:35,126
I tried my birthday just in case,
and it worked.

653
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:40,464
Your uncle gave it to you
because it's the safest with you.

654
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:47,221
Since the day Ms. Kim approached me,
it's always been your game, right?

655
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:48,806
What?

656
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,518
You're right.

657
00:48:52,602 --> 00:48:56,981
Yong wanted you
to arrest Hwang Gi-seok yourself.

658
00:48:57,982 --> 00:49:02,361
I used money against money,
so it's only right to use law against law.

659
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:05,489
All you need to do
is to finish it off neatly.

660
00:49:05,573 --> 00:49:06,657
Hold on.

661
00:49:07,283 --> 00:49:11,120
You're saying I'm the only one
who didn't know about your confession,

662
00:49:12,413 --> 00:49:14,332
the evidence and such?

663
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:18,794
-I was basically your pawn, then.
-But you were the most important piece.

664
00:49:18,878 --> 00:49:21,672
A lawyer must investigate
according to the law,

665
00:49:21,756 --> 00:49:24,133
so it isn't invalidated by the court.

666
00:49:24,717 --> 00:49:27,511
-Right.
-I mean, the information you gave me--

667
00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:31,557
-What if I took advantage of it?
-Like that's going to happen.

668
00:49:31,641 --> 00:49:34,226
It's not like you would've struck
a deal with Hwang.

669
00:49:34,935 --> 00:49:37,688
You're not me, you know.
How unrighteous of you.

670
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:40,941
We need prosecutors

671
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:44,153
who won't give up until the end,
like you and Chief Ham,

672
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:47,323
in order to establish law and order.

673
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,241
That's right.

674
00:49:49,784 --> 00:49:52,495
Joon-gyeong trusted you more than I did.

675
00:49:53,371 --> 00:49:55,498
She believed
you'd fight to the end and win.

676
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:04,507
Hey, drink up. Lighten up.

677
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,635
A toast! For my nephew, Jang Tae-chun!

678
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:09,679
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

679
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,975
<i>My uncle's plan started</i>
<i>way before Ms. Kim Bok-sun</i>

680
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:18,020
<i>came to see me.</i>

681
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:23,567
<i>When Myung decided to blow up Bawoo Fund,</i>
<i>our plan utterly failed.</i>

682
00:50:24,944 --> 00:50:28,280
<i>My uncle returned to his cell</i>
<i>and came up with a new plan--</i>

683
00:50:29,782 --> 00:50:32,326
<i>a plan to wipe out Myung and Hwang</i>

684
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,746
<i>but also their hosts,</i>
<i>cartels of power and money,</i>

685
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,373
<i>the masterminds of it all.</i>

686
00:50:38,457 --> 00:50:42,169
<i>The first piece he needed was…</i>
<i>Hwang Gi-seok.</i>

687
00:50:43,546 --> 00:50:46,632
<i>Back then, he was abandoned,</i>
<i>hurt and power-hungry.</i>

688
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:50,094
<i>In order to control him,</i>

689
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:54,557
<i>my uncle used his wife,</i>
<i>who coveted power over money.</i>

690
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:58,352
<i>He threw the director of inspection</i>
<i>some bait</i>

691
00:50:58,978 --> 00:51:01,355
<i>to create bad blood between him and Myung.</i>

692
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,484
<i>He drove Hwang Gi-seok to rock bottom</i>

693
00:51:06,736 --> 00:51:07,862
<i>to isolate him.</i>

694
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:11,907
<i>At last, Hwang Gi-seok kneeled</i>
<i>before my uncle.</i>

695
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:14,827
<i>Uncle used Hwang Gi-seok</i>

696
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,748
<i>to start a fight against the cartel lords.</i>

697
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:24,128
<i>As expected, he proved to be</i>
<i>an effective weapon.</i>

698
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:25,629
<i>As a result,</i>

699
00:51:25,713 --> 00:51:29,133
<i>Myung and his connections</i>
<i>were the first to be removed.</i>

700
00:51:30,676 --> 00:51:35,681
<i>Hwang, who regained his power,</i>
<i>misjudged that he could have everything.</i>

701
00:51:37,183 --> 00:51:41,812
<i>He brought his own downfall</i>
<i>by pocketing Chairman Myung's money,</i>

702
00:51:43,022 --> 00:51:44,815
<i>which turned out to be a trap.</i>

703
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:48,903
<i>Hwang Gi-seok and Chairman Myung</i>

704
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:51,363
<i>will now face their judgment</i>
<i>before the law.</i>

705
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,344
Hwang Gi-seok once asked me this:

706
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:17,890
why you're risking your fortune
for my revenge.

707
00:52:21,644 --> 00:52:23,979
He wouldn't get it even if I told him.

708
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:26,565
He would never understand.

709
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:27,691
I know.

710
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:33,447
But while I was talking to him,
I was reminded of something I'd forgotten.

711
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,616
What is it?

712
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:39,870
Thank you.

713
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:47,962
I don't think I ever thanked you.

714
00:52:50,673 --> 00:52:52,508
We all worked together on this.

715
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:55,845
You started it, and Tae-chun ended it.

716
00:52:56,929 --> 00:52:59,265
Han-nah, Mr. Nam and Chief Ham--

717
00:52:59,348 --> 00:53:01,642
We all worked together as one
to achieve it.

718
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:04,645
You're the one who made us one.

719
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:07,648
We all believed in you.

720
00:53:14,196 --> 00:53:16,991
Like when you fought alongside me
on that train,

721
00:53:17,825 --> 00:53:19,326
when you see injustice,

722
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,246
you fight for them
no matter who you're up against.

723
00:53:23,372 --> 00:53:25,875
Then you face its consequences alone.

724
00:53:31,797 --> 00:53:33,632
You're an incredible and kind person.

725
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,928
That's how you've always been
and always will be.

726
00:53:39,471 --> 00:53:41,181
Why are you talking like your mom?

727
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:43,475
Mom said that about you.

728
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:47,897
-Let's give her the gift.
-Oh, right.

729
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:00,200
We are rebuilding

730
00:54:01,076 --> 00:54:02,494
your company, Mrs. Yoon.

731
00:54:03,913 --> 00:54:06,790
I'll make sure
it'll be successful this time.

732
00:54:09,668 --> 00:54:11,086
I hope she's happy.

733
00:54:21,847 --> 00:54:24,725
For Mr. Nam, I've prepared something big.

734
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:25,809
What's that?

735
00:54:26,685 --> 00:54:27,895
-Oh, my.
-What is it?

736
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:30,481
-Unbelievable!
-It's spinning.

737
00:54:30,564 --> 00:54:32,691
Your somaek is being prepared, Mr. Nam.

738
00:54:32,775 --> 00:54:34,068
No way.

739
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:36,987
-Here's your somaek.
-Thank you.

740
00:54:37,071 --> 00:54:41,408
<i>We hosted a party to celebrate</i>
<i>Mr. Nam's honorable retirement.</i>

741
00:54:42,242 --> 00:54:45,329
-I know how to pour beer.
-You sure do. Look at these bubbles.

742
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:47,498
Like this?

743
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:51,335
Cheers to Mr. Nam's bright future!

744
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:53,253
Cheers!

745
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,297
-Thank you.
-Great work, sir.

746
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,097
I've had my share of somaek,
but this tops them all.

747
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,473
Oh, my.

748
00:55:38,757 --> 00:55:41,093
This is my last ramen in the office.

749
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:48,934
It's your retirement ceremony tomorrow.
Aren't you sad?

750
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:54,148
Sad, my foot. I was unlucky enough
to work with you towards the end.

751
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:55,566
I'm even working late today.

752
00:55:58,402 --> 00:56:01,530
I'm very sad and bummed.

753
00:56:03,198 --> 00:56:05,492
That's part of being a prosecutor.

754
00:56:06,368 --> 00:56:08,120
I'm sure you'll transfer well.

755
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:09,955
The best place for me

756
00:56:10,748 --> 00:56:12,416
is right beside you, Mr. Nam.

757
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:16,420
Mr. Nam.

758
00:56:17,755 --> 00:56:19,423
Thank you for your guidance.

759
00:56:21,175 --> 00:56:22,342
I'm grateful.

760
00:56:26,638 --> 00:56:28,265
If you're so thankful,

761
00:56:29,475 --> 00:56:32,269
don't pick up my calls after I retire.

762
00:56:35,147 --> 00:56:37,232
You couldn't refuse my shady favors,
right?

763
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:40,903
Come on.
I doubt you'll pull something like that.

764
00:56:41,904 --> 00:56:44,114
Well, I tell myself I won't do that.

765
00:56:44,823 --> 00:56:46,533
But no one knows the future.

766
00:56:47,493 --> 00:56:49,495
My colleagues who seemed so upright

767
00:56:49,578 --> 00:56:52,247
began calling with favors
a few years after their retirement.

768
00:56:56,794 --> 00:57:01,131
<i>When I was working on rebuilding Bluenet</i>
<i>with the help of Yong,</i>

769
00:57:02,007 --> 00:57:03,634
<i>I was exhausted, yet happy.</i>

770
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:07,763
<i>When your passion finds</i>
<i>something hopeful to strive for,</i>

771
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:10,057
<i>that feeling is called happiness.</i>

772
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,601
<i>In that trail of thought,</i>

773
00:57:13,685 --> 00:57:16,480
<i>I was reminded</i>
<i>of my mom's life of passion.</i>

774
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:20,484
<i>As my final work,</i>

775
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,113
<i>I decided to write a biography</i>
<i>about my mom.</i>

776
00:57:27,783 --> 00:57:29,576
Regarding the illegal short trading,

777
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,287
I think the fine and tax penalty
will be a hefty amount.

778
00:57:34,665 --> 00:57:36,166
We should follow the law.

779
00:57:37,084 --> 00:57:38,335
Don't file an appeal.

780
00:57:39,545 --> 00:57:41,046
Let's just pay them off.

781
00:57:43,048 --> 00:57:44,049
Fine.

782
00:57:45,134 --> 00:57:49,054
And make sure the Bawoo Fund victims
get their rewards.

783
00:57:49,763 --> 00:57:50,764
Yes, sir.

784
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:55,853
When will you come back this time?

785
00:57:58,647 --> 00:58:00,149
I'm not sure.

786
00:58:04,528 --> 00:58:06,155
I'll return this to you now.

787
00:58:07,823 --> 00:58:09,449
This is where you belong.

788
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,425
<i>Before I left,</i>

789
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:30,846
<i>I visited Joon-gyeong's house,</i>
<i>just like the day I left ten years ago.</i>

790
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:42,024
Gosh. I guess there won't be
any flower gifts for the time being.

791
00:58:42,983 --> 00:58:43,984
Right.

792
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:47,029
You're flying out tomorrow?

793
00:58:47,112 --> 00:58:49,531
-Yes.
-Keep in touch.

794
00:58:49,615 --> 00:58:52,784
Instead of flowers,
send me pictures of you.

795
00:58:53,744 --> 00:58:54,953
Of course.

796
00:58:55,037 --> 00:58:57,247
You'll do well wherever you go.

797
00:58:58,874 --> 00:59:00,250
I'm not sure about that.

798
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:03,128
Dealing with money is fun,
and it suits me.

799
00:59:04,296 --> 00:59:06,006
But it scares me at times.

800
00:59:06,882 --> 00:59:11,553
Watching Chairman Myung not blink an eye
even when someone died, because of money,

801
00:59:12,304 --> 00:59:14,056
this thought crossed my mind:

802
00:59:14,806 --> 00:59:18,727
"If I continue down this path,
I might end up like him."

803
00:59:21,355 --> 00:59:24,858
Money is scary.
I sometimes think that too.

804
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:27,361
You do?

805
00:59:27,903 --> 00:59:29,404
I'm no different.

806
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:34,201
When I'm low on money from business,
I think of money.

807
00:59:34,284 --> 00:59:36,745
When I make some money,

808
00:59:36,828 --> 00:59:40,082
I think of money again,
planning what to use it on.

809
00:59:40,624 --> 00:59:42,334
I think of money all the time.

810
00:59:42,417 --> 00:59:44,795
Still, you're different.

811
00:59:44,878 --> 00:59:47,756
You're different from loan sharks
like me and Chairman Myung.

812
00:59:49,508 --> 00:59:52,302
When it comes to money,
everyone is the same.

813
00:59:55,055 --> 00:59:59,268
When you get tired of your travels,
know you're always welcome here.

814
00:59:59,935 --> 01:00:01,895
I'll make you a bowl of delicious soup.

815
01:00:05,232 --> 01:00:07,192
Not delicious, but salty soup.

816
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:15,617
Stay healthy…

817
01:00:17,035 --> 01:00:18,578
and take care.

818
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:21,039
-I'll see you soon.
-Of course.

819
01:00:21,123 --> 01:00:22,249
I'll keep in touch.

820
01:00:31,425 --> 01:00:32,926
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

821
01:00:34,803 --> 01:00:35,929
Jang Tae-chun!

822
01:00:36,471 --> 01:00:38,557
Yes-- Yes, ma'am.

823
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:43,020
Why isn't the investigation report
on my desk yet?

824
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:49,234
I was working on it past midnight
and fell asleep.

825
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:51,278
Have it ready
before the afternoon meeting.

826
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:54,281
Get yourself together.
You'll be late to the morning trials.

827
01:00:54,865 --> 01:00:56,158
Yes, ma'am.

828
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:07,419
What makes a good prosecutor?

829
01:01:07,502 --> 01:01:11,173
Grit, effort, stamina and endurance.
Stamina trumps them all.

830
01:01:11,256 --> 01:01:13,050
And the issue of today's trial?

831
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:16,053
The authentication of perjury.

832
01:01:16,636 --> 01:01:19,765
We'll submit that expert's statement.
Read it on the way.

833
01:01:20,474 --> 01:01:21,475
Yes, ma'am.

834
01:01:21,558 --> 01:01:24,394
<i>Everyone is back where they belong.</i>

835
01:01:45,499 --> 01:01:47,000
PASSION

836
01:01:47,084 --> 01:01:49,711
CEO OF BLUENET, YOON HYE-RIN

837
01:01:58,637 --> 01:02:00,430
<i>Here's a gift for you.</i>

838
01:02:00,514 --> 01:02:01,932
<i>Thought you'd need this.</i>

839
01:02:39,142 --> 01:02:46,137
