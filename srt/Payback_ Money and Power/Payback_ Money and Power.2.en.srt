-Let's have a drink.

Gosh! Why are you doing this?

-You can't be doing this.
-What did we do?

14
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:11,202
I'll buy everything.
Just tell me how much.

-What are you all looking at me for?
-Please let go!

Mind your own business, all right?

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,170
What are you all looking at?

18
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,758
Is this entertaining?

19
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:29,262
<i>I was released from juvie two days ago,</i>
<i>so I couldn't afford to get into trouble.</i>

20
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:35,185
Let me borrow this umbrella.

21
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:38,354
Please stop and return to your seats.

22
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:42,692
What's up with this girl?

23
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:45,361
Have you lost your mind?
Do you have a death wish?

24
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:48,323
-My goodness.
-Gosh, I hope she'll be okay.

25
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:56,080
-This is going to hurt.
-Go ahead.

26
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:58,875
-Go on, hit me.
-"This is going to hurt"?

27
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,878
Make sure you get hit properly,
or else it'll tickle.

28
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,589
You little punk. She said it'll hurt.
You better watch out.

29
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,257
My gosh.

30
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:08,218
-Who the hell are you?
-Using the bathroom.

31
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:10,553
Then get the fuck out of my way.

32
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:12,514
-It's all right, sir.
-Go ahead, hit me.

33
00:02:12,597 --> 00:02:15,558
-I told you to move, you punk.
-Go on and hit me.

34
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:18,478
-What the hell is he doing?
-I have no idea.

35
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:19,938
Hey schoolgirl, get them!

36
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,409
You shit!

37
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:53,096
You bastard--

38
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:02,188
-Come here!
-Come here!

39
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,318
Hey, get out of here.

40
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:09,863
Hurry up. Get lost. Move it.

41
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:14,158
They threw the first punch.
We're the victims here!

42
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:16,077
That's not something to brag about.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,538
You should be ashamed
of those tattoos on your arm.

44
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:29,591
Hey, schoolgirl.
You think this is mutual combat?

45
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:33,344
Wait. Is this your first offense?
Do you not know what that is?

46
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:36,306
How is this mutual?
They are the ones who started it.

47
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,391
Gosh, but you…

48
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,603
hit them too hard.

49
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,313
Park Joon-gyeong!

50
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:48,943
What are you doing in there?

51
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,571
Hello. What brings you here?

52
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:54,741
I'm Park Joon-gyeong's guardian.

53
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:01,497
You must be Yoon Hye-rin,
the CEO of Bluenet.

54
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:04,000
I was told you'd be coming.
Please come this way.

55
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:10,590
DEFENDANT PARK JOON-GYEONG
GUARDIAN YOON HYE-RIN

56
00:04:12,258 --> 00:04:14,552
The statements of the victims
and passengers corroborate,

57
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:18,056
and the victims have quite a record,
so there won't be any big issues.

58
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:22,310
Is this the kid
who fought alongside Joon-gyeong?

59
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:26,314
Yes. He was in a juvenile center before
and doesn't have a guardian.

60
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:28,942
So we'll have to question him some more.

61
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:35,239
Well, then, the investigation of this case
isn't quite over yet, is it?

62
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:37,867
Well, Joon-gyeong is free to go.

63
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:42,205
Joon-gyeong,

64
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:45,875
you go back in there
and tell him to come out for questioning.

65
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,001
Excuse me?

66
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,381
He fought alongside her, so I'll join
the questioning as his guardian.

67
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,677
Hey, your name is-- Oh, right.

68
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:57,637
Eun Yong.

69
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,431
Come out here. It's your turn now.

70
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:03,142
-Excuse me, ma'am. Actually--
-What are you doing?

71
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:05,937
Go back in and tell him to come out.

72
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,398
Ma'am,
we'll take care of that punk oursel--

73
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:10,149
Hey, where are you going?

74
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:11,234
Hey.

75
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:15,363
-Open the cell for me.
-Why would you come back inside?

76
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:19,575
Ma'am, you're making this difficult.
It's late as well.

77
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,494
I'm used to working late hours.

78
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,455
I'll stay here until the end
as his guardian.

79
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:29,669
-That's not the problem here.
-I'm telling you I'll be his guardian.

80
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:31,879
Why is that a problem?

81
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:37,093
Can you please not make this
difficult for us?

82
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:40,096
Park Joon-gyeong's questioning is over,
so go home with your daughter.

83
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,889
That's not true.

84
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:45,018
It's not over until our teammate,
that boy, is finished with questioning.

85
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:48,271
I looked over the report,

86
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:51,649
and it appeared as if minors need
their guardians to sign off on things.

87
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,818
I'll be that guardian.

88
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:09,417
All right. Have some of this.

89
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:13,046
Eating tofu prevents you
from going back to jail.

90
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:18,676
The pajamas fit well.
It's what her dad used to wear.

91
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:21,596
Ma'am,

92
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:25,058
I'm an ex-con
who was released from juvie two days ago.

93
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:27,226
Are you okay
with bringing me into your home?

94
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,270
You don't even know who I am.

95
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:30,813
You are on our team.

96
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,524
I signed off as your guardian.

97
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:36,569
I heated up the study,
so you can sleep there.

98
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:39,030
I'll clean the room up for you.

99
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:41,199
You don't have to. I'll do it.

100
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,242
Will you do that for me?

101
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,478
I guess the smart kids
all have one of these.

102
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:12,355
What are you doing?

103
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,857
Don't touch anything and go to bed.

104
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:30,873
You're going to study here?

105
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:32,834
I'm here to keep my eyes on you.

106
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:40,216
If you try to do anything funny,

107
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:43,136
I'll kill you.

108
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:51,185
What about your father?

109
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,651
I don't have any parents.

110
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:02,738
Your mom must feel relieved
to have such a good fighter as a daughter.

111
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:05,366
I'll sleep fine.

112
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:10,788
I'm used to sleeping
with people around anyway.

113
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,328
<i>That was the first time</i>

114
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:53,247
<i>I'd ever had a good night's sleep.</i>

115
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,751
<i>Pajamas you can only see on TV.</i>

116
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:00,838
<i>When I woke up,</i>

117
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:04,175
<i>I had an unfamiliar feeling</i>
<i>that I was in paradise.</i>

118
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:06,636
CERTIFICATE

119
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,971
FIRST PLACE

120
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:14,810
You're awake.

121
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,773
Are you hungry? Let's eat breakfast.

122
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:24,403
I didn't make much.

123
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:27,490
Joon-gyeong went to school,
and I have to go to work soon.

124
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:30,243
Thank you for the food.

125
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,007
Your daughter seemed like she's at the top
of the class and a perfect student.

126
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:48,469
-Why didn't you scold her?
-She stood up for a cause. Why would I?

127
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:54,642
Why did you end up
in a juvenile detention center?

128
00:09:56,644 --> 00:10:00,356
I robbed a bank.
I took about one billion won.

129
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:04,735
I never imagined I'd be
cooking breakfast for a bank robber.

130
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:07,655
Oh, the soup. I totally forgot.

131
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,080
Smells salty.

132
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:18,916
Let's just eat it.

133
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:33,306
If the reason you commit crime is
because it's your livelihood, then stop.

134
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,768
I run a company.

135
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:41,772
If you want to work,
I can find you a job at the factory.

136
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:47,069
-Does it pay well?
-Depends on how much you work.

137
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:51,157
Can I keep this business card?

138
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:55,911
What's the purpose of a business card
if I'm going to ask for it back?

139
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:04,628
Salty, right?

140
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:06,797
That's how soup should be.

141
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,724
I hope I see you often.

142
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:19,935
Sure.

143
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,274

The Special Investigations department
is in charge of the case.

153
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:57,533
That's why she can't be reached.

00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:04,832
You should get some sleep.
I'm sure you must be exhausted.

156
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:11,589
No. It's too late to get any sleep anyway.

157
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,637
I saw that Special Investigations
was in charge of CEO Yoon's case.

158
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:21,140
Is her case connected to Chairman Myung's?

159
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:27,062
CEO Yoon was arrested
without a warrant because…

160
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:32,151
This is a copy of Minister Son's
secretary's work diary.

161
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:35,404
You see what's written on there?
"Bluenet Yoon, 5,000"?

162
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:40,242
I do see it. But what is this?

163
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:43,913
I think you know better than I do.

164
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,080
I mean, gosh.

165
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:49,835
I've never given him this money.

166
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,588
As of now,
you are not a witness but a suspect.

167
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:56,842
<i>She was accused of bribing</i>
<i>Minister Son Seung-jun,</i>

168
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:59,720
<i>her college friend,</i>
<i>by giving him over $50,000.</i>

169
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:03,307
<i>The person who conducted the investigation</i>
<i>was Hwang Gi-seok,</i>

170
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:05,559
<i>Myung's son-in-law.</i>

171
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,437
Chairman Myung's son-in-law?

172
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:12,650
<i>He's infamous for cooking up stories,</i>
<i>whatever the ingredient may be.</i>

173
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,444
<i>Within the prosecution,</i>
<i>people call him Chef Hwang.</i>

174
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:21,158
<i>He's an elite, and many expect him</i>
<i>to become the future attorney general.</i>

175
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:26,163
Then what he really wanted
was probably Minister Son.

176
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:29,542
You're right.
Chef Hwang eventually got him.

177
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,836
Minister Son, who had the most support
as a candidate for governor,

178
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,506
had to withdraw his candidacy
due to bribery charges.

179
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:39,510
But CEO Yoon was acquitted
in the first trial.

180
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:42,680
The investigation fizzled out
after Son stepped down.

181
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:46,559
Then why?

182
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:48,852
Are you sure it was a suicide?

183
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,234
I just sent you a video. Watch it.

184
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:20,301
<i>I can't think of any other explanation</i>
<i>besides suicide.</i>

185
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:25,097
<i>The case was closed as a suicide</i>
<i>due to depression from the investigation.</i>

186
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:27,641
That can't be right.

187
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,728
She'd never do this.

188
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:50,914
<i>I knew you'd be the strongest fighter.</i>

189
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,419
Let's work under Seong-tae for a bit
and form our own gang.

190
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:57,880
You be the boss,
and I'll be your right-hand man.

191
00:15:57,963 --> 00:15:59,965
Right-hand man, my foot.

192
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:02,843
We'll buy a fancy jacket from Italy
and go to a bar and drink.

193
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:06,347
We will even drink coffee at a hotel.
Why? You don't want that?

194
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,891
Let me have a think, you punk.

195
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:10,684
You be quiet.

196
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:13,354
Come on. I'll make it happen.

197
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:22,029
You got a girlfriend recently or what?

198
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:25,991
How can you leave me out?

199
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:29,912
What are these flowers for?

200
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,207
They were on sale, so…

201
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,210
They're roses.

202
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:39,380
I've never bought flowers before,
so I got a bunch.

203
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:42,800
Buy me a bunch often, okay?

204
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:45,302
Yes. I'll make sure to do that.

205
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:50,349
-Come on in and eat.
-Sure. What's on the menu today?

206
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,290
<i>Even back when I worked as a thug…</i>

207
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:20,546
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

208
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:23,132
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

209
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,592
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mom</i>

210
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:28,011
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

211
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,225
Blow the candles out!

212
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,778
<i>Even when I was working</i>
<i>for the loan sharks…</i>

213
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:14,016
<i>she was a silver lining to me,</i>
<i>who was living in a world</i>

214
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,102
<i>where only the strongest survived.</i>

215
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:27,696
I liked her with all my heart.

216
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:34,161
She was the first grown-up
to ever treat me like a human being.

217
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:36,872
She was a respectable woman.

218
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:39,583
I don't understand.

219
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:43,796
She would never do something like this.

220
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:46,548
What can you do
even if you find out the real reason?

221
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:49,760
Vengeance?

222
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:53,388
It's not like that's going to
bring back the dead.

223
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:58,352
With Hwang Gi-seok in his family,

224
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:01,772
Myung is no longer just a loan shark.

225
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:05,734
If you think about it,

226
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:09,905
taking revenge on someone is too risky
compared to the reward.

227
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:12,699
You should always pay back what you owe.

228
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:16,870
Don't weigh your losses but your values.

229
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,041
That's what Ms. Yoon did for me.

Chief Prosecutor, why are you all riled up
over a commie newspaper?

242
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:40,370
What nonsense are you talking about?

KIM SEONG-TAE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GMI BANK

You couldn't even take care of
a Rambo thug and let this blow up?

246
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,006
I apologize, sir.

247
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:54,468
You're a thug too, aren't you?

248
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,929
Listen closely, Gi-seok.

249
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:59,640
I won't go down alone if I get indicted.

250
00:21:04,353 --> 00:21:05,437
What's with the look?

251
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,816
You insolent prick, how dare you?
I'm your senior.

252
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:26,249
It turns out that this fucking punk

253
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,796
teamed up with Yeouido Rambo
right under your nose, sir.

254
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:40,806
Mr. Kim.

255
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:49,022
Why don't you admit it?

256
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,070
Sure.

257
00:21:57,364 --> 00:21:58,490
Good.

258
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,289
I will close the case
on Director Kim's embezzlement.

But still, you're taking it too far
in front of your senior.

00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:16,883
I sincerely apologize for worrying you.

261

00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,948
Have a drink.

00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:42,743
I don't want to.

265
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:46,413
I'll get some appetizers ready too.

266
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:49,624
It was such a humiliation
at the book concert.

267
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,334
Even the party leader was there.

The reporters keep calling me.

Welcome, sir.

276
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:32,626
I've sent the subpoena
for Assemblyman Baek.

277
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,961
-Thank you, Woo-jin.
-Not at all, sir.

278
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:37,297
I got this from Chief Park.

279
00:23:38,256 --> 00:23:39,466
Take a look.

280
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,927
Jang Tae-chun…

281
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,888
Yeah. He's the one
who blew up the Rambo case.

282
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:46,389
Is the report of any use?

283
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:50,685
The author of this report is unusual.
Isn't he from a no-name university?

284
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,104
He is.

285
00:23:52,187 --> 00:23:54,231
Because he's from a lousy school,

286
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:57,275
he really dug deep
into the silver-spoon corruption case.

287
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,905
Although he's a paper tiger now,
he's served four consecutive terms.

288
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:04,533
We needed to throw the liberals
some bait to chew on.

-The informant?
-We're questioning her. But she's…

00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:10,413
-Why?
-Take a look, sir.

On July 11,
did you go to a club in Cheongdam?

294
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:30,725
It's not against military law for a single
person to go clubbing on a day off.

295
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:35,021
After CEO Yoon's death,
she joined the army.

296
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:38,650
-She's a major and a staff judge advocate.
-We have evidence.

297
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:41,820
Then how will you explain…

298
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:46,575
the CCTV footage here?

299
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:51,496
Doesn't the bag you're carrying
belong to the intoxicated Rambo,

300
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:53,748
Lee Chang-min?

301
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:57,419
You are aware that this is theft, right?

302
00:24:57,502 --> 00:25:02,090
Also, leaking confidential material
can be considered trade-secret piracy.

303
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,560
As the staff judge advocate,
I'm sure you know well

304
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:18,231
that nothing good comes from staying
silent when the evidence is so clear.

00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:26,364
It's situational, but Rambo did use it
as evidence of stock-price manipulation.

307
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:29,910
Add the remark about the patent law
on the indictment.

308
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:31,203
Yes, sir.

309
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:37,834
I'm an investigator from Army Prosecution.
We'll be taking her now.

310
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:39,377
What the hell?

311
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:42,547
-Can't you see we are questioning her?
-Who do you think you are?

312
00:25:42,631 --> 00:25:44,549
Article 44 of the Military Court Act.

313
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:47,260
"The power to investigate a soldier
belongs to the army."

314
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,524
Let's go.

315
00:26:05,153 --> 00:26:07,781
-What do we do?
-Just let them go.

316
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:12,494
What about Kim Seong-tae?

317
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:15,997
He voluntarily came
to Prosecutor Jang's office.

318
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:25,257
You traded 10 billion with loan sharks
without your CEO knowing?

319
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:33,181
Mr. Oh was in charge of external affairs,
while I took care of the company inside.

320
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:35,767
What's up with your nose?

321
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,019
A lanky piece of shit…

322
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:41,106
I tripped.

323
00:26:46,027 --> 00:26:49,698
Assault, blackmail, fraud, and even drugs.

324
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:51,241
Wow.

325
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:55,287
You have quite the record.
You must've really used your iron fist.

326
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,914
You and your stereotypes.

327
00:26:58,581 --> 00:27:01,334
Everyone who runs a business has
some kind of past record.

328
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:04,587
I've seen many conglomerate heads
during my time in prison.

329
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:09,467
How much do they pay to go to prison
for them? Enough to buy a house?

330
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,389
I already own a few apartments.

331
00:27:15,056 --> 00:27:17,309
Do you know how much tax I pay for them?

332
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:21,855
I'm not so poor that I would go to prison
for someone to earn some pocket change.

333
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:25,859
All right, then. Let's dig deeper into it.

334
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:30,697
I'm not clever, but I became a prosecutor
thanks to my perseverance.

335
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:33,199
Well, let's dig deeper, then.

336
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,996
Ma'am, order me a large jjajangmyeon.

337
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,206
Not from Jageumseong, though.

338
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,708
Order it from Seochobanjeom.

339
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:43,960
What about you, Prosecutor?

340
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:46,421
What do you think you're doing?

341
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:49,424
It's going to be long, so let's eat first.

342
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:53,178
Isn't Seochobanjeom the best
Chinese restaurant near this office?

343
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:03,188
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

344
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:05,982
Yes.

345
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,569
I'll be right up. Bye.

346
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:13,073
Someone looking for you?

347
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:16,618
Go ahead, while I enjoy my food.

348
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:18,119
Chief,

349
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,457
get everything ready
to hold this man in custody.

350
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:30,715
I'll see you in different clothes
tomorrow.

351
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,926
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

352
00:28:57,325 --> 00:29:00,203
<i>The Special Investigations department</i>
<i>is on the 7th floor.</i>

353
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:03,248
<i>I can't even open its door</i>
<i>with my employee ID card.</i>

354
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,083
ID CARD, JANG TAE-CHUN
CENTRAL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

355
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,502
You must be Jang Tae-chun.

356
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:09,671
Oh, yes.

357
00:29:14,384 --> 00:29:15,510
Please follow me.

358
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:21,599
<i>Why did Chief Hwang Gi-seok call for me?</i>

359
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:25,562
<i>Which could it be?</i>
<i>External pressure or placation?</i>

360
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,237
Hello, sir.

361
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:37,740
Prosecutor Jang. Welcome. Come sit.

362
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:41,077
Take a seat.

363
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:53,506
It's hectic with the big case
in your hands, huh?

364
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,510
You were pretty good in front
of the reporters for a first-timer.

365
00:29:57,594 --> 00:29:59,179
You must be a natural.

366
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:02,348
If you called me about the case,
I have nothing to tell you.

367
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:05,143
Why would I meddle in your case?

368
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:08,188
I know how to keep my boundaries.

369
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:13,109
I enjoyed reading the report
on Assemblyman Baek's case.

370
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:17,530
Although your vocabulary
and investigation seem a bit rough,

371
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:18,615
it's fine.

372
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:19,991
Actually, pretty good.

373
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:30,043
-I hear you want to join our department.
-Excuse me?

374
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:33,087
Chief Park told me you are
quite ambitious for big cases.

375
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:34,380
Am I wrong?

376
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:38,426
You cornered him well,
so wrap up the case nicely.

377
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,721
When everything settles down,
I'll buy you a drink.

378
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:44,349
What's the matter?

379
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:47,685
I finally found a prosecutor
worthy of joining my department.

380
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,854
So I should buy you a drink as a senior.

381
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:52,607
<i>"Senior"?</i>

382
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,736
Have you ever met with your seniors
from the anti-corruption department?

383
00:30:57,904 --> 00:30:59,030
<i>Seniors…</i>

384
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:00,990
No, sir.

385
00:31:01,074 --> 00:31:02,325
We'll meet them too.

386
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:06,246
They've taken on big cases several times,
so I'm sure they'll be helpful.

387
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:11,000
-Yes, sir.
-Show me the indictment when finished.

388
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,503
You've worked hard on it,
so I'll review it.

389
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:15,421
Keep this in mind:

390
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:18,758
Law books are ideals,

391
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:20,802
but this is reality.

392
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:24,597
Hold on.

393
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:32,605
You must be busy. You may leave now.
I'm getting a call.

394
00:31:36,484 --> 00:31:37,777
Have a good day, sir.

395
00:31:50,582 --> 00:31:51,583
Hello?

396
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,376
<i>Gosh, my son-in-law.</i>

397
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:56,462
Looking at how long it took for you
to pick up my call,

398
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:58,631
you must be busy serving your country.

399
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:01,384
-Did you eat?
-Please get to the point.

400
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,886
Did you talk to Prosecutor Jang,
the rookie?

401
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,431
<i>Were you able to get through to him?</i>

402
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:10,351
Do you want a report or something?
Leave us alone so we can do our jobs.

403
00:32:10,435 --> 00:32:11,436
SON-IN-LAW

404
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,146
That wasn't what I wanted to talk about.

405
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:16,190
I'm thinking of wrapping up GMI Bank.

406
00:32:16,274 --> 00:32:18,568
Sure. I'd appreciate it
if you could do it yourself.

407
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:19,694
<i>Seriously?</i>

408
00:32:19,777 --> 00:32:22,071
Why are you giving me the cold shoulder?

409
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:25,074
<i>This is all family business.</i>

410
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:28,661
The shares your wife has, the 20%--

411
00:32:29,245 --> 00:32:30,747
Is it okay if I move that?

412
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:32,498
Hold on.

413
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:36,544
What about the chief prosecutors' shares?

414
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:40,965
Those old goats' shares
will be taken care of through Mr. Oh.

415
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:43,134
<i>So don't you worry.</i>

416
00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:44,677
How's Mr. Oh doing?

417
00:32:53,144 --> 00:32:54,687
He's doing just fine.

418
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:07,241
What are you looking at?

419
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:09,661
The NYSE market closed today.

420
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:14,123
I'm looking at GMI bank.
Chairman Myung began the delisting plan.

421
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,000
Delisting?

422
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:18,670
He's destroying evidence.

423
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:21,172
It's like scrapping a car
after a hit-and-run.

424
00:33:21,255 --> 00:33:25,635
Destroying evidence of stock manipulation
by delisting it?

425
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:28,805
It's easier for the prosecutor
watching their backs,

426
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:30,723
since they can't investigate any further.

427
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:34,394
They'll throw away all they have
to protect Oh Chang-hyeon.

428
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:38,231
I looked into it, and Chairman Myung's
connections to the prosecution

429
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:42,193
are being handled by CEO Oh,
a former chief prosecutor.

430
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:47,699
That means we have to take
CEO Oh down first.

431
00:33:50,743 --> 00:33:54,414
Hey, is there anything in here
other than veggies?

432
00:33:54,497 --> 00:33:56,082
Like some chicken?

433
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:57,834
How about we order chicken?

434
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:00,253
People say K Chicken
is the best these days.

435
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:03,423
Hey, just eat this.
These days, vegan food is the best.

436
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:06,467
Why are you against everything
I want to do?

437
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:07,760
Seriously…

438
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:14,058
Hey, hold on. Are there any
convertible bonds of GMI Bank

439
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:16,269
used illegally to obtain cash in April
at Dongdaemun?

440
00:34:16,352 --> 00:34:18,604
You think you can dig into that?

441
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:20,898
The cartels there
are close to Chairman Myung.

442
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:25,987
I'm aware. I know them pretty well too.

443
00:34:32,076 --> 00:34:34,579
<i>The cartels in Dongdaemun</i>
<i>are divided into four areas,</i>

444
00:34:34,662 --> 00:34:37,373
<i>north, south, east, west,</i>
<i>bordering the clothing shops.</i>

445
00:34:37,457 --> 00:34:41,252
<i>The leaders of the cartels are women</i>
<i>who collect money from the shops.</i>

446
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:45,381
<i>Of them, Ms. Kim from the west,</i>
<i>was the greediest.</i>

447
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,138
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

448
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:55,892
Manager Eun, have you spoken to
the chairman about starting on your own?

449
00:34:55,975 --> 00:34:58,478
He even knows that I'm meeting you today.

450
00:34:58,561 --> 00:34:59,562
Is that so?

451
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:02,607
Will he provide you with connections?

452
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:05,943
You know he's not the type.

453
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,239
Gosh, that greedy old goat.

454
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:13,701
I'd be willing to help you out, Mr. Eun.

455
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:16,287
You know it's not easy
to find good clients.

456
00:35:17,455 --> 00:35:18,915
I already have one.

457
00:35:18,998 --> 00:35:21,167
A very trustworthy client.

458
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,085
Who? How many orders?

459
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:26,047
About 30.

460
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,008
But you have to keep this a secret.

461
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:32,512
I've been in the business long enough
to know that.

462
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:34,263
Your secret is safe with me.

463
00:35:38,184 --> 00:35:40,853
<i>When I was standing on my own feet</i>
<i>from Chairman Myung,</i>

464
00:35:42,563 --> 00:35:46,192
<i>Ms. Yoon's Bluenet was investing</i>
<i>everything it had into patents</i>

465
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:47,735
<i>on chipset technology.</i>

466
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:51,364
But… do you have the money to do it?

467
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,201
I've been preparing for a year now,

468
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:58,079
and I have the cartel leaders
on my side as well.

469
00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:02,250
Why are you trying to stand
on your own feet?

470
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,586
Chairman Myung--

471
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:08,631
He's too greedy.

472
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:13,177
I already have a supplier.

473
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:17,723
So I'll compare the rates with yours
and make a decision.

474
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:20,142
It's just business, so we're okay, right?

475
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:23,479
You'll get a percent cheaper rate
than your supplier with no conditions.

476
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:27,525
Because I'm someone you know?

477
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:32,905
If you can get a patent on the chipset,
the company will become big.

478
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:36,409
I'm cutting the rates based on
what I've learned, since it's business.

479
00:36:40,663 --> 00:36:42,915
I look forward to working with you,
Mr. Eun.

480
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:47,753
Thank you so much.

481
00:36:49,505 --> 00:36:52,341
I think Mongyu will do so well.
What do I do?

482
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:56,178
Hey, then how about
you give me a cigarette?

483
00:36:56,262 --> 00:36:57,305
All right.

484
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,058
Here you go.

485
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:04,645
I have the perfect gift to celebrate
the opening of your office.

486
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:06,856
Really? What could it be?

487
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:11,235
-Money toad?
-No need for superstitions like that.

488
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:13,112
You need a picture of me in there.

489
00:37:13,654 --> 00:37:15,406
I was blessed with wealth.

490
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:17,033
Gosh, of course.

491
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,160
-What the hell?
-My goodness.

492
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:22,079
-Hey, Major!
-Are you smoking again, Mom?

493
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:25,082
-What do you mean?
-Not at all. This is mine.

494
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,793
Didn't I tell you to
stop bringing cigarettes here?

495
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:29,462
I'll quit.

496
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:32,840
Oh, hey. You two must be starving.
Let's go eat.

497
00:37:32,924 --> 00:37:34,675
Gosh, I'm so famished.

498
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:36,344
No cigarettes in my house.

499
00:37:36,427 --> 00:37:38,304
A student shouldn't be
coming home this early.

500
00:37:38,387 --> 00:37:41,015
Do you not have a boyfriend?
If not, you should get one.

501
00:37:55,988 --> 00:37:58,115
-Sir.
-Yes.

502
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:03,037
I bought a few of the loan ledgers
you asked for.

503
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:05,373
Thank you.

504
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:08,292
I'm asking such absurd favors
to a global hedge-fund partner.

505
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:10,252
I'm glad you know.

506
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:13,547
But I had a good time. It's been a while.

507
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:17,843
M&A negotiation and market bargaining
are basically the same thing.

508
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:20,930
We bought them for cheap,
so let's sell them at a high price.

509
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,599
I'll catch CEO Oh with this.

510
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:29,063
Let's have dinner.
I'll treat you to a nice place tonight.

511
00:38:29,146 --> 00:38:30,147
Well…

512
00:38:30,231 --> 00:38:33,985
I'm going to do some shopping
while I'm here.

513
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:35,277
You should take my car.

514
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:38,698
Do I have somewhere to be?

515
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:41,075
Major Park Joon-gyeong.

516
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:44,704
She managed to escape the prosecution
since she's a soldier.

517
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,971
<i>Joon-gyeong's opponent, Chairman Myung,</i>

00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:56,192
Yes, sir.

524
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:58,319
Yes, I'm here.

525
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:00,696
But I don't see anyone.

526
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:02,865
Yes, sir.

527
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:05,284
Okay.

528
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:09,538
Yes. I am in front of the church.

529
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:14,251
Okay, got it. Goodbye.

530
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,726
Oh, my. You're killing the kid.

531
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:19,817
Sir.

532
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:22,695
Why are you doing this?

533
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:26,532
You were such a competent employee,
Manager Eun.

534
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:29,618
You skyrocketed our earnings.

535
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:34,081
But look here, you punk.

536
00:41:34,165 --> 00:41:37,543
If the goose laying golden eggs
wants to leave,

537
00:41:38,335 --> 00:41:40,254
what is its owner supposed to do?

538
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:45,301
It would be logical to split it open
for the last golden egg

539
00:41:45,384 --> 00:41:47,678
and eat what's left of it, no?

I'm on my way, sir.

550

Have a drink or two first.
I'll be there soon.

Yes, sir.

Does it hurt a lot?

554
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:52,243
Then you'll need one of these.

555
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,175
Just endure it a little. This won't hurt.

556
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:26,318
Bring it on.

557
00:43:26,944 --> 00:43:28,362

<i>But it was possible back then.</i>

615
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:30,891
Let's do it more quickly. Concentrate.

616
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:33,477
Timing is key here.

617
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,479
Number 11, buy 2,000 shares.

618
00:49:35,562 --> 00:49:37,439
Numbers three, six, nine,
buy 8,000 shares.

619
00:49:37,522 --> 00:49:39,858
From number ten.
Get ready to buy at 4,500.

620
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:41,735
Not yet. Just wait a moment.

621
00:49:42,986 --> 00:49:44,446
Right now, 4,500.

622
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:46,406
The rest just follow up.

623
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,993
All right. Numbers three, six, seven
will buy at 8,500.

624
00:49:50,077 --> 00:49:52,245
Number ten will go at 8,700.

625
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:58,460
We'll watch how it works out
and take it slow from now on.

626
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:01,797
Number four, Sinheung Securities.

627
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:04,466
Buy 5,000 shares at 6,200 won.

628
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:08,679
Right, Daeyong Securities, number 12.
It's 2,000 shares, okay?

629
00:50:08,762 --> 00:50:12,057
Numbers three and seven,
you are both 1,000 shares each.

630
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:15,102
Let's sell 4,900 shares from number ten!

631
00:50:28,865 --> 00:50:31,326
All right, we're going up. Looking good.

632
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,121
It's going up! Great!

633
00:50:36,164 --> 00:50:38,208
<i>What's wrong with the stocks?</i>

634
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:41,837
-I think there's a concert party.
-My goodness. Seriously?

635
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,548
Then just don't sit back and watch.

636
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:46,049
<i>Stop them by buying more shares,</i>

637
00:50:46,133 --> 00:50:49,469
<i>or use the press to spread bad rumors</i>
<i>about the company.</i>

638

BLUENET SALES HALVED

BLUENET NET WORTH FALLS 14%

642
00:50:57,686 --> 00:51:02,357
All right. Whenever they short a stock,
we buy one right away.

643
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:06,486
We're almost done here, okay?
Let's speed this up a bit.

644
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,947
-Okay!
-Number 11, 11,000 won.

645
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,866
Number four, 11,500 won.

646
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:13,326
Numbers ten, eight, nine, at 12,000 won.

647
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,328
-Click the "buy" button!
-All right!

648
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,050
<i>With all the apes following up</i>
<i>thanks to the age of the Internet,</i>

649
00:51:30,135 --> 00:51:31,845
<i>the battle was decisive.</i>

650
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:34,806
For stock shorting,
which relies on stocks plummeting,

651
00:51:35,474 --> 00:51:37,142
there is a limit on the profit.

652
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:41,438
Even if the stock crashes,
it can't go below zero.

653
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:44,274
Right,
but if the short sellers lose money,

654
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:47,319
they can lose an infinite amount.

655
00:51:48,528 --> 00:51:51,281
There's no limit
to how much a stock can go up.

656
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:55,285
If we pressure them with this,

657
00:51:56,578 --> 00:51:59,164
I'm confident that
we can beat the short sellers.

658
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,293
I'm sure raising the stock price

659
00:52:03,877 --> 00:52:07,839
can be done
with the amount of shares I have.

660
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:12,344
But our opponent is colluding
with a mega-securities company.

661
00:52:13,178 --> 00:52:14,930
You think you can hold up?

662
00:52:15,013 --> 00:52:17,349
This is the age of the Internet.

663
00:52:17,432 --> 00:52:21,645
If we give them the proper information
instead of fake news,

664
00:52:21,728 --> 00:52:24,147
the retail investors
will definitely be on our side.

665
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:27,609
How are you so sure?

666
00:52:28,527 --> 00:52:30,737
Because the values
of your company are real.

667
00:52:32,197 --> 00:52:34,491
Just as you believed in me,
I believe in you.

668
00:52:35,617 --> 00:52:37,536
I believe in your values.

You know how things work here.

708
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:08,353
If you take him into custody
and interrogate him,

709
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:10,438
don't you think they will find evidence?

710
00:55:10,522 --> 00:55:14,275
But still, there needs to be grounds
to issue an arrest warrant.

Miss, I don't know who it is,

719
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:54,733
I called him.

720
00:55:54,816 --> 00:55:56,067
Bring him in.

721
00:56:07,412 --> 00:56:08,830
Look who this is.

722
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:14,919
It's been a while, Chairman Myung.

723
00:56:21,217 --> 00:56:24,512
I mean, Manager Eun over here,

724
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:27,849
he has a knack for memorizing numbers.

725
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:33,521
He told me some of
your borrowed-name accounts.

726
00:56:36,316 --> 00:56:37,650
I found lots of issues.

727
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,781
Forget about the dessert.

728
00:56:42,864 --> 00:56:44,240
You can have it back.

729
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:47,827
I don't want my belly to pop out
with all those sweets anyway.

730
00:56:49,454 --> 00:56:50,789
By the look of it,

731
00:56:50,872 --> 00:56:54,751
I think something troubling happened
between you two while working.

732
00:56:56,086 --> 00:56:59,005
So why don't you relax
and have a nice time together

733
00:56:59,964 --> 00:57:01,674
and talk things out peacefully?

734
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:08,598
Goodbye, sir.

735
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:20,777
Desserts won't do.

736
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,113
I gave him 10% of my shares.

737
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:29,160
You punk. How dare you run your mouth?

00:57:29,244 --> 00:57:30,537
Watch me.

739
00:57:31,329 --> 00:57:32,872
I'm going to kill you.

740
00:57:32,956 --> 00:57:37,210
Regarding the assault last time, I'll
settle for the money I made this time.

741
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:42,132
Hey. Above Prosecutor Lee, there's his
chief, deputy chief, and chief prosecutor.

742
00:57:43,216 --> 00:57:44,634
I'm well aware.

743
00:57:44,717 --> 00:57:48,763
The borrowed-name accounts they use
for dirty money are in my head.

744
00:57:48,847 --> 00:57:50,807
How can I not know?

745
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:54,185
You want me to write
those accounts down too?

746
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:06,573
Let's settle this peacefully.

747
00:58:07,323 --> 00:58:09,784
I'll leave the country within a week.

748
00:58:11,536 --> 00:58:15,915
Oh, right. As for Myung-dong, you can do
whatever you want, like always.

749
00:58:20,086 --> 00:58:21,421
Why?

750
00:58:21,504 --> 00:58:24,757
The sword's already drawn,
so let's fight until the end.

751
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:29,512
I might have, if you fought with money.

752
00:58:30,805 --> 00:58:32,557
But you fight using real knives.

753
00:58:38,813 --> 00:58:40,148
However,

754
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,484
do not harm my family.

755
00:58:46,946 --> 00:58:48,656
That is my one and only condition.

756
00:59:01,544 --> 00:59:05,965
<i>Chairman Myung…</i>

758
01:01:26,939 --> 01:01:29,025
The only person he wants to save is you.

759
01:01:29,108 --> 01:01:32,153
Chief Hwang is not one to talk nonsense.

-What?

01:01:43,122 --> 01:01:46,376
Baek argues the accusation against his son
is a vindictive investigation.

765

Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun ordered it.
