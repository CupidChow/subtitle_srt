NEW YEAR'S
DISCIPLINARY TOUR PERIOD

00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:00,487
Hey, kid.

9
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:02,322
What are you in here for?

10
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:04,491
Mugging? Theft?

11
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,078
<i>I was 12 years old that winter.</i>

12
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:10,956
<i>I got locked up</i>
<i>for my first attempt at a dine and dash.</i>

13
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,374
<i>It was cold and scary.</i>

14
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,626
He's my brother. Why can't I see him?

15
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,462
Bring your parents first.

16
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,255
We don't have one.

17
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:20,215
I'm his guardian!

18
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,092
Minors aren't qualified whatsoever.

19
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,303
Any adult will do,
if you don't have parents.

20
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:26,555
Hurry up and go.

21
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:31,018
Detective, on that day…

22
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,439
I keep telling you…

23
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:38,275
It wasn't me.

24
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:40,569
Hey!

25
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:43,363
What do you think you're doing?
Have you lost your mind?

26
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:47,075
I don't need parents
to get arrested, right?

27
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:53,832
-Yong!
-Sis!

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,461
Yong, are you okay?
It's all right, I'm here now.

29
00:01:57,544 --> 00:01:59,797
-Come here.
-Sis!

30

-Come here!
-Hey!

31
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,509
If anyone of you thugs mess with Yong,

32
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,844
-I'm going to kill you all!
-Sis!

33
00:02:05,928 --> 00:02:09,014
Yong, are you okay? Are you injured?

34
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:11,350
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,227
Don't cry. Sorry for coming so late.

36
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,188
I'm sorry, there's no need to cry.

37
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:18,232
We didn't do anything wrong.

38
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:19,525
You must've been scared.

39

<i>My sister did whatever it took</i>

Don't worry, I'll protect you.

44

<i>One spring day,</i>
<i>when flowers were fully bloomed,</i>

45
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,543
<i>my 19-year-old sister mothered a son.</i>

46
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:44,925
Eun Yong, you're here.

47
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,470
Say hello to your sister and your nephew.

48
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:49,763
Yong.

49
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:52,724
I am a mother now.

50
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,435
Commend me for it.

51
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:57,396
<i>A fatherless child.</i>

52
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,984
<i>I thought this would be another burden</i>
<i>and tragedy for my sister.</i>

53
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:04,236
Dear Lord, please shepherd this child

54
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:07,823
towards the way of righteousness.

55
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:10,993
I pray his words will spread your gospel

56
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:14,079
and his actions will spread your love.

57
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:17,040
As the flowers bloom in spring,
the warm love of spring…

58
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:18,792
<i>The poetry-loving nun named him…</i>

59
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:21,086
-In Jesus' name I pray.
-<i>…"peaceful spring."</i>

60
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,755
-Amen.
-Jang Tae-chun.

61
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:25,757
<i>His name was Tae-chun.</i>

62
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,293
Have you lost your mind?

63
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:03,211
You're a wanted man.
You shouldn't be here.

64
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:06,381
If I hide, you'll pay the price.

65
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:09,468
There's only one way out.

66
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:11,845
Hey, Jang Tae-chun.

67
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,306
Cuff me…

68
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:18,852
with your own hands.

69
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:36,036
WANTED FOR BLACKMAILING
CEO OH OF GMI BANK

70
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:38,038
Yes, sir.

71
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:41,583
For the time being,
I have Hwang Gi-seok in my office.

72
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:44,836
Questioning him won't lead us anywhere.

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,421
He'll just elude our questions.

74
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:49,800
I'll figure out what happened first.

75
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,302
Yes, sir.

76
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:54,346
Don't worry. I'll let you know soon.

77
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,521
Hey.

78
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:07,567
What the hell is this?

79
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:08,735
EVIDENCE COLLECTED

80
00:05:10,946 --> 00:05:12,406
This your father-in-law's villa?

81
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:15,826
Yes. You've been there a few times.

82
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:21,331
This is why Oh killed himself?

83
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:27,462
Hey, you son of a bitch.

84
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,214
You think you're so clean?

85
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:31,216
You took our bribes, then backstabbed us.

86
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,509
You're not so clean either.

87
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:35,262
You little bastard.

88
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:36,680
Fuck.

89
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:41,518
Hello?

90
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:42,728
Why?

91
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:44,604
What?

92
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:47,983
Fucking damn it.

93
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:51,862
<i>Is it true you blackmailed CEO Oh</i>
<i>into committing suicide?</i>

94
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:54,364
<i>Any comment</i>
<i>on the suicide note he left behind?</i>

95
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:58,660
<i>The late CEO Oh was</i>
<i>a great business partner of mine.</i>

96
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:03,123
We have reliable friends
who can vouch for our relationship.

97
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:05,625
And as for everything else,

98
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,586
I'll tell the prosecution in detail.

99
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:09,379
Who are these reliable friends?

100
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:11,173
Did you meet high-profile officials?

101
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:12,716
All right, we'll stop here.

102
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,800
He turned himself in?

103
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:15,302
-<i>Wait!</i>
-<i>One more question!</i>

104
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:18,889
-<i>Give us one comment!</i>
-<i>One more question!</i>

105
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,564
Do you know
who these "reliable friends" are?

106
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:33,528
I hope it's not you, Chief.

107
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:36,031
-What'd you say?
-Looks like you lost the initiative.

108
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:39,034
If he turns himself in like that,
the press will move on.

109
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:42,204
They'll focus on finding
these so-called "reliable friends"

110
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:43,914
rather than the wanted criminal.

111
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,207
You little shit--

112
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,917
Just let me take care of it.

113
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:50,545
I'll wrap it up neatly,

114
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:53,131
so that no harm comes to you either.

115
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:57,511
With that brought to light,
you want me to trust you?

116
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,513
Take care of it yourself then.

117
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,014
You bastard.

118
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:03,058
Trust me.

119
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,233
I'm Hwang Gi-seok.

120
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:16,029
Damn.

121
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:27,415
You can uncuff him now.

122
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:33,713
You've entered the lion's den on your own.

123
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,424
It won't be easy.

124
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:39,845
You're Chief Nam Sang-il, right?

125
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:43,306
Please take good care of Prosecutor Jang.

126
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,391
Gosh.

127
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,018
You should worry about yourself.

128
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,445
Hand over the suspect to us.

129
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:58,655
No.

130
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:01,408
He's our wanted criminal.

131
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:03,785
He notified us he'd be coming in.

132
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:06,872
And I'm the prosecutor in charge
of the GMI Bank Case.

133
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:08,540
Not anymore.

134
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:11,418
I'm from Inspection.
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

135
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:15,130
You're under arrest
for leaking confidential information.

136
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,549
You can't arrest me.
I wasn't even caught in the act.

137
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:20,093
Have you lost it?
Who do you think you're arresting?

138
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:21,761
What do you think you're doing?

139
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,144
Get rid of the cuffs.

140
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,646
Just take him, Prosecutor Jang.

141
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,398
You're still a prosecutor, after all.

142
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,986
And you had such a bright future too.

143
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:43,200
Thanks to your uncle,
you're about to be in cuffs.

144
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:54,127
A prosecutor strikes a suspicious deal
with his ex-con uncle

145
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:56,129
who runs a hedge fund.

146
00:08:57,964 --> 00:08:59,341
Nice headline.

147
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,095
The sanatorium fees for Jang's mother,
it costs 30 million won a month.

148
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:06,932
That's 400 million won a year.

149
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:12,103
A hedge fund owner uncle
and a 400 million won sanatorium.

150
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:16,441
That's enough to infuriate the citizens.

151
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:18,360
They'll sentence him themselves.

152
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,697
Why did you kill CEO Oh?

153
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,285
Haven't you seen his suicide note?

154
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,162
On the note,

155
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:33,208
it stated that he committed suicide
because of your blackmailing.

156
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,880
You are aware of that, no?

157
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,803
Gosh, but I really didn't see this coming.

158
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:47,931
I wasn't expecting for you
to turn yourself in like this.

159
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:50,850
I'm sure it was your plan
to up my charge count

160
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:53,561
while I was on the run,

161
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:56,564
and make me out to be
the vilest criminal before arresting me.

162
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:58,608
Am I wrong?

163
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:02,487
Well, I didn't expect you'd threaten me
so publicly in front of the reporters.

164
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,489
Mentioning your reliable friends and all.

165
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:07,450
Right.

166
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:09,703
That was unexpected.

167
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:12,330
Nice one.

168
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:16,167
I didn't expect my reliable friends
to arrange a meeting with you

169
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:18,295
so quickly either.

170
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,675
What a shame.

171
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:28,555
If we didn't meet as enemies,
we could've been good friends.

172
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:30,890
You and I are enemies?

173
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,520
Well, I don't think so.

174
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:39,482
My enemy is Chairman Myung.

175
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:44,946
You're just a leech sucking on
your father-in-law's blood.

176
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:13,224
I thought you were with CEO Eun.

177
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:16,186
We saw the investigators out front,
so we parted ways.

178
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:17,854
I told him to go to my house for now.

179
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:20,857
You know he's not the type to listen.

180
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,984
Whenever there's a problem,
he's always in the lead.

181
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:25,695
He's all about making the first move
to win a fight.

182
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,323
He turned himself in
because of Prosecutor Jang, right?

183
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:30,658
I think so, but that's not the issue.

184
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:33,370
Thanks to him for making it
on the news in cuffs,

185
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:35,413
our company is a complete mess.

186
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:38,750
Do you have any idea
how much money we lost today?

187
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:44,881
Well, it was his choice,
so I don't want to give you an earful.

188
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,009
But honestly, I kind of want to.

189
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:50,220
Go ahead.

190
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,847
I'm just worried for him
in the prosecution.

191
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:54,849
Hwang Gi-seok won't let him off easy.

192
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,351
Don't worry about that.

193
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,813
We hired the most expensive attorney
we could buy.

194
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,405
Sir! Welcome!

195
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:09,572
KIM OH-CHEOL
ATTORNEY GENERAL

196
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:10,657
Hey, guys.

197
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:13,118
Oh, Chief Hwang. It's been a while.

198
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:14,786
-Allow me to lead the way, sir.
-Okay.

199
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,793
I've prepared some chrysanthemum tea,
the one you used to enjoy, sir.

200
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,461
Let's go to my office first and--

201
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:26,548
No need. I'm here as an attorney today.

202
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:28,049
I'll meet the suspect first.

203
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,136
I apologize for saying this,
but he's not here.

204
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:33,096
We just sent him to jail.

205
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,347
What did you say?

206
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,434
My sincere apologies, sir.

207
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:39,018
I should've told you sooner.

208
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,786
EMERGENCY ESCORT

209
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:57,889
You know what this is, don't you?

210
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:02,685
This is the report of the GMI Bank Case,
which you investigated yourself.

211
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:04,854
INVESTIGATION REPORT

212
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:07,398
And this is the report that we found

213
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,776
on a computer from your uncle's company.

214
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:14,906
What do you think? Looks the same, right?

215
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:17,617
According to the security check,

216
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,246
it seems definite that this file
has been leaked from your office.

217
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:27,794
ATTACHED FILE
JANG TAE-CHUN.PDF

218
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:28,878
SEND

219
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:33,216
Prosecutor Jang, you know keeping quiet

220
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,426
isn't going to help your situation.

221
00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:37,136
I know.

222
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:41,224
I know that there's no use,
even if I list you the names

223
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:45,979
of those who received those bribes!

224
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:48,439
I am very well aware.

225
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:50,608
Jeez.

226
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:55,738
I guess his insolence was to be expected,
given that he's from a no-name university.

227
00:14:56,781 --> 00:15:01,452
Even so, if you corner him this far,
Eun Yong won't just sit back and watch.

228
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,206
This is going to be a problem
for my kids' school too.

229
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,585
If he tells everyone about the meeting
at the Supreme Office, it'll be trouble.

230
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:13,715
Well, Chef Hwang
said he'd take care of it.

231
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:15,592
So let's see what happens.

232
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:18,553
If there aren't any results
within three days,

233
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,930
Assemblyman Baek
will bring Hwang down anyway.

234
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:27,228
That cheeky bastard.

235
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:30,189
This flash drive contains

236
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:34,027
the original copy of the fabricated file
you gave Hwang Gi-seok?

237
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,405
Yes, it's the piece of evidence
submitted to prosecution back then.

238
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,324
The list of Bluenet's recovered debts.

239
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:43,620
<i>I took the flash drive</i>
<i>from the company safe.</i>

240
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:46,331
<i>In it, there was a ledger account,</i>
<i>saved as an excel file.</i>

241
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:48,207
2009 SEPTEMBER 8,
CEO PARK, 50 MILLION WON

242
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:52,920
<i>Next to the 50 million won expense,</i>
<i>I changed the name to Minister Son</i>

243
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:56,633
<i>as per Hwang Gi-seok's instructions.</i>

244
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,053
SEPTEMBER 30, 2009
BLUENET CEO YOON HYE-RIN

245
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,601
I've attached a statement from
Chuho University's forensic service,

246
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:08,019
confirming it's the original.

247
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:12,482
An internationally approved institution,
it has the same legal power as the NFS.

248
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:14,942
Are you ready for
the second press conference?

249
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:19,030
We'll blow this up in three days
according to the party leader's schedule.

250
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:21,032
Then we'll file a suit.

251
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:23,993
The National Assembly will audit,
appoint special prosecutors.

252
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,454
We'll do everything we can to corner them.

253
00:16:26,537 --> 00:16:29,791
We love this strong support
with the election just around the corner.

254
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,712
The likes of Hwang Gi-seok
who plays dirty and sly

255
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:38,966
must be brought down
so that our country can stand tall.

256
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,721
It's how we can get CEO Eun released.

257
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:29,308
-I'm meeting the guard here?
-Yes.

258
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:30,727
Wait here for a minute.

259
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:34,397
What? What's going on? Officer!

260
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:36,524
What are you…

261
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:38,317
What is… Hey!

262
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:05,052
Welcome.

263
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:09,182
I think I'll be out of here
before the weekend.

264
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,353
It's all thanks to you.

265
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,527
I'm sorry you can't come with.

266
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:23,780
So when I leave,

267
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm going to hold your hand tight!

268
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:30,661
Don't you worry.

269
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:33,372
The saw blade is sharp,
so it'll be a neat cut!

270
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:42,423
-Fuck!
-My goodness, sir!

271
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:53,643
Move!

272
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,028
You little shit!

273
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,864
Finish him!

274
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,298
You bastard!

275
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:35,810
Stay down!

276
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:40,064
Damn it!

277
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:20,855
Bring it on.

278
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,028
Bring it.

279
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:29,322
Bring it on!

280
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:36,037
You crazy fucker.

281
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,998
Gosh, this bastard.
You're quite persistent, you know that?

282
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:10,821
Inmate 4816. Are you feeling okay?

283
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:23,084
Gosh, I was gone for a bit
and look what happened.

284
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:28,422
The guy you stabbed in the workshop,
inmate 101, died last night.

285
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:32,093
What?

286
00:21:45,982 --> 00:21:47,066
Hello?

287
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:48,359
What were you doing not picking up?

288
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:51,070
What do you think?
I got suspended, so I slept in.

289
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:54,407
Your uncle just murdered
an inmate in jail!

290
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,491
What?

291
00:21:56,867 --> 00:22:00,788
One of the inmates who fought Yong
died at the workshop.

292
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:04,041
<i>The murder weapon, a screwdriver,</i>
<i>had Yong's fingerprints on them.</i>

293
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,168
What about Yong's testimony?

294
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:08,462
Obviously, he said he didn't do it.

295
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:10,047
He said he was the one who got attacked,

296
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,883
<i>and when he pulled himself together,</i>
<i>the inmate was already dead.</i>

297
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:15,678
He says Kim Seong-tae wore gloves
to frame him.

298
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:17,555
That bastard stabbed him in the neck.

299
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,181
The screwdriver was in the neck and…

300
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:21,142
He suddenly came in
and stabbed him in the neck.

301
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:23,644
When I came to my senses,
blood was dripping from it.

302
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:27,023
All other prisoners at the scene
are pointing at your uncle.

303
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:30,818
Wait, they're working together?

304
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:34,321
Well, yeah.
They're all under Kim Seong-tae.

305
00:22:34,864 --> 00:22:37,867
I think this was all planned.

306
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,829
<i>We're at a complete disadvantage here</i>
<i>due to the prints and witnesses.</i>

307
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:44,457
The blackmailing of CEO Oh
isn't the issue anymore.

308
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,208
He's going to be a convicted murderer!

309
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:49,754
Do you think I can get
the police investigation report?

310
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:52,173
Where are you? I'll meet you there.

311
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:59,013
Who is the detective in charge?

312
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:01,307
<i>I'm on my way to meet him right now.</i>

313
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,142
Okay. I'll head over right away.

314
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,783
This is Jang Tae-chun.

315
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:22,703
What?

316
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,903
Nice to meet you. I'm Myung Se-hui.

317
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:59,490
MYUNG SE-HUI
YORIGA, FOOD RESEARCHER

318
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,284
What did you want
to tell me about my uncle?

319
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:07,164
You don't look like him,
but you're just as impatient.

320
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,167
Why don't we go in?

321
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:25,724
This is puffer fish stew
stirred in clam broth.

322
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:32,982
No, thank you.

323
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,359
You seem so gaunt though.

324
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:38,988
I heated it up, so at least try the soup.

325
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:42,825
Well, then.

326
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,375
Manager Eun…

327
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:55,212
He's the kindest out of all the people
who worked under my dad.

328
00:24:57,131 --> 00:25:00,426
Oh, you do know who I am, right?

329
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:08,642
Yes, I am well aware of
who your father and husband are.

330
00:25:08,726 --> 00:25:10,186
That's why I want to help.

331
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:13,272
I want to clear him
of the false murder charge.

332
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:16,483
False charge?
Did you just say false charge?

333
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:20,237
It's obviously a false charge.

334
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:24,533
There's no way a kind person like him
would kill anyone.

335
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:28,829
How are you going to help us?

336
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:41,342
The original copy Park Joon-gyeong has.

337
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:43,802
That's all I need.

338
00:25:49,892 --> 00:25:52,228
Bring it to me
before it gets to Assemblyman Baek.

339
00:25:53,646 --> 00:25:56,732
Then my husband will take care
of yesterday's incident.

340
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,526
<i>How can we trust her?</i>

341
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:01,862
If you can trust her,

342
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,782
would you accept the deal?

343
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:08,035
If you are willing,
then I'll negotiate with her.

344
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,496
So that we'll have leverage.

345
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:15,209
You both know how my mother died.

346
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:17,962
I can't repeat the same mistake again.

347
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,964
I'm not negotiating with Hwang.

348
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:21,924
Then what about CEO Eun?

349
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:24,426
We can cope with losing the company.

350
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,428
But if he's facing a homicide charge--

351
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:28,180
He'll be sentenced to at least ten years.

352
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:32,893
Ten years is the minimum.
Are you still going to leave him be?

353
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:35,104
The truth must be revealed.

354
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:37,439
That's what got us here!

355
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:40,442
I've seen this happen countless times.

356
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:44,446
If we don't act on time,
he might really get a 10-year sentence!

357
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,365
I specifically told Yong.

358
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:49,827
That we'll take this to the end
no matter what.

359
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,121
Don't you think you're being selfish?

360
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:55,124
Yes, I am selfish.

361
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:59,128
I have another appointment,
so I'll get going.

362
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:04,383
She has an appointment
in the midst of all this?

363
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:06,260
Hey, Jang Tae-chun.

364
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,679
Don't you think she's being absurd?

365
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:14,518
I'll meet with the detective in charge

366
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,313
and keep you updated on the situation.

367
00:27:29,992 --> 00:27:31,201
Let's go.

368
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:34,288
-Have you eaten?
-Yes.

369
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:37,791
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

370
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:41,712
A HAPPY COUNTRY,
A JUST PROSECUTION

371
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:43,797
Hey!

372
00:27:49,345 --> 00:27:52,931
The sitter couldn't make it
because she has enteritis.

373
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:54,683
All of a sudden, this morning.

374
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,811
But what can I do?

375
00:27:57,895 --> 00:27:59,355
So I came to work with my baby again.

376
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:03,108
You happy?
Are you happy to feel the breeze?

377
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:05,444
Have you read the investigation report?

378
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:06,612
I did.

379
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:09,615
You've never asked me favors
regarding a case before.

380
00:28:09,698 --> 00:28:11,950
So I found it strange
and read it right away.

381
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,161
But…

382
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:18,248
I told you the backstory of the incident.

383
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,959
This is a trap. It's a false charge.

384
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:23,629
Yeah. It's all because of that son of…

385
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:28,258
That bastard.

386
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:32,346
get that Hwang is connected to all this.

387
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:36,767
But it's hard to turn the tables around
when his prints were found on the weapon.

388
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:39,812
But the witness statements

389
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:42,773
all sounded the same,
like it was a concocted story.

390
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:47,361
Gosh, what's wrong, Da-in?

391
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:50,572
Why? Did you poo poo?

392
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:52,658
No, you didn't.

393
00:28:53,784 --> 00:28:56,078
You just ate earlier. Come on.

394
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:57,955
It's been a hectic day for you.

395
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:00,207
Please, I'm begging you.

396
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,085
Can you read over it thoroughly
just once more time?

397
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:08,215
Are you saying
I didn't read the case properly

398
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,010
because I came to work pushing a stroller?

399
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:14,430
No. That's not what I meant.

400
00:29:14,513 --> 00:29:17,433
It's fine. I hear it often.

401
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,519
Da-in.

402
00:29:20,602 --> 00:29:23,897
Let's say goodbye to her and go back in.

403
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:26,358
Thanks for the coffee.

404
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:47,004
NORTHWEST CHEONAN
POLICE STATION

405
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:48,547
You've already met him?

406
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:52,926
<i>I read the investigation report,</i>
<i>but I don't see a way out.</i>

407
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,136
What about the CCTV?

408
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,348
Isn't there CCTV everywhere in jail?

409
00:29:58,432 --> 00:29:59,725
They keep track of everything.

410
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:02,728
It is everywhere.
But some weren't even working.

411
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:05,230
The backdoor CCTV
to the workshop was completely broken.

412
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:07,524
Gosh, seriously.

413
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:14,823
Goodness. Slow down. Have some food too.

414
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:17,493
Drinking fast can upset your stomach.

415
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:23,707
Chief.

416
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,085
What do we do about my uncle?

417
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:29,296
Oh, man…

418
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:31,298
He's from your maternal side?

419
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:34,426
You two seemed very close.

420
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,770
Chief…

421
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:48,106
I lied to you.

422
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,651
My mom.

423
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:54,988
She wasn't a housekeeper.
She worked at a bar.

424
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:57,449
She worked at a teahouse before that.

425
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:07,084
Your mother must've had it tough.

426
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,504
She did indeed.

427
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:15,551
That's why I liked when my uncle visited.

428
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:18,387
I always hung out
with my mom's lady co-workers.

429
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:22,683
But I felt proud when he visited.
We walked around town, holding hands.

430
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,561
My uncle always said he'd be my dad.

431
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:29,356
In a way, he was my dad.

432
00:31:30,107 --> 00:31:33,610
When my uncle came to visit,
I felt like I had a father.

433
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:36,738
We have family members like that.

434
00:31:37,698 --> 00:31:39,992
Those more parental
than your biological ones.

435
00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:41,910
Those you're closer to than your siblings.

436
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:45,706
I knew it. I knew you could relate.

437
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,670
And I know very well
about living a life of agony

438
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:55,799
because of such a family member.

439
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:19,656
Joon-gyeong.

440
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,964
Park Joon-gyeong.

441
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:39,259
Please save my uncle.

442
00:32:40,594 --> 00:32:41,762
I beg you.

443
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:44,598
I'm sorry.

444
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:49,436
You're not the only one in pain!

445
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:57,069
You're not the only one.

446
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:04,826
My mom had me when she was 19.

447
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,871
She worked at a bar her whole life
and got dementia at 40.

448
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:12,709
You know why I became a prosecutor?

449
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:15,837
The sons of bitches
who looked down on my mom.

450
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:19,091
The bastards who scorned us
for being a widow and an orphan.

451
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:21,093
I wanted to put them all behind bars.

452
00:33:21,927 --> 00:33:26,431
Those pricks who step all over
the weak and impoverished.

453
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:30,936
I wanted to show them that
Oh Bong-sun's son,

454
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,480
that the Madame Eun's son,
had become a prosecutor

455
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:35,899
and was ready
to lock all those criminals up!

456
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:37,484
That was my dream!

457
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:42,447
That's exactly what we're doing right now.

458
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,702
But Joon-gyeong.

459
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:50,622
Saving my uncle should come first.

460
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:54,334
I'm all for vengeance, justice, and law.

461
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:57,003
But family comes first before all that!

462
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:59,214
Get a grip, you fool!

463
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,552
You think striking a deal with them
will save your uncle?

464
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,471
You have no idea!

465
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:09,516
You've no idea how I lost my mom!

466
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:12,936
No deals will be made.

467
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:15,021
I will not give up either.

468
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:17,607
I will get my revenge

469
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:19,985
and I'll save Yong.

470
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:12,996
Hey, working at the dinner table tells me

471
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,332
you're not so efficient at work.

472
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:17,959
-I just have a lot to do.
-Gosh.

473
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:22,255
-Hey!
-Fine.

474
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:26,551
Seriously. You're so boring.

475
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:29,888
We're the only ones in this house.

476
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:31,640
Call Yong.

477
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,934
He's not even in Korea.

478
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:37,813
He doesn't even contact you?

479
00:35:40,023 --> 00:35:41,733
He must be busy making money.

480
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:44,736
I loved it when Yong was here.

481
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,322
He lightened up the mood
and made it feel like home.

482
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:51,284
Even if I offered to treat him
to some rib eye steak,

483
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:54,037
he always said my <i>jjigae</i> was the best.

484
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,793
I wanted to ask you something
for a long time.

485
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:03,338
What made you bring him home
when you first saw him at the station?

486
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:06,883
He was an orphan and ex-con.

487
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:10,971
He's not the type
people offer to be their guardian.

488
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:16,351
When I bring in people for questioning,
my first impressions are always wrong.

489
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,229
I didn't know either.

490
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:22,607
I just tried to make my best effort.

491
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:25,193
Best effort?

492
00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:27,404
As an adult.

493
00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:31,157
<i>He fought alongside you.</i>

494
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:33,243
I'll be that guardian.

495
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:37,873
He would've been alone again,
if I didn't become his guardian.

496
00:36:41,918 --> 00:36:45,547
This fight isn't for you to fight alone.

497
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,133
Your mom was like family to me.

498
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:50,719
You and I,

499
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:52,804
we're on the same team.

500
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:08,445
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

501
00:37:08,528 --> 00:37:10,947
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

502
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:13,909
<i>Happy birthday, Dear Mom</i>

503
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:17,829
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

504
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:21,374
Left foot, right foot.

505
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:25,462
-Up three times.
-You suck at this, Yong.

506
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:13,927
Gosh.

507
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:16,054
Wow.

508
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:18,223
IMPLEMENTING LAW AND ORDER
CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT

509
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:21,935
I mean,
smell the difference in the air quality?

510
00:38:22,018 --> 00:38:23,979
Walls sure keep us cooped up.

511
00:38:24,062 --> 00:38:28,024
Sir, why don't we go out for some booze?

512
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:31,194
Gosh! You must be out of your mind.

513
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:33,780
You know how much money
I spent to get both of us out?

514
00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:34,990
You trying to be funny?

515
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,534
Follow me in your car!

516
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:39,828
We have a ton of work to do
back at the office.

517
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:48,128
Gosh.

518
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:52,507
Great work, sir.

519
00:38:53,883 --> 00:38:56,386
Oh, you're here.

520
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:58,388
I thought you'd be busy
serving your country.

521
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:13,820
I went to a funeral.

522
00:39:13,903 --> 00:39:17,907
A funeral? Did someone die?

523
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:20,785
CEO Oh's funeral.

524
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:22,662
Oh, right.

525
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:26,916
That old man did leave us.

526
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:31,713
He'll be moved to his burial tomorrow.
Would you like to visit?

527
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:33,423
No, it's fine.

528
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:37,135
You and I paid money
to express our condolences anyway.

529
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:40,263
Did you take care of your situation

530
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:42,974
by connecting Eun Yong to it?

531
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:45,393
Yes, thanks to your care.

532
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:49,689
We still have to wrap up
the past incident on CEO Yoon.

533
00:39:49,773 --> 00:39:52,025
But Baek is working with Park, so…

534
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:54,110
I see.

535
00:39:56,654 --> 00:40:00,450
The late CEO Yoon's daughter,
she isn't someone to take lightly.

536
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:04,412
We've offered Prosecutor Jang a deal
through my wife.

537
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:06,706
But we're also coming up with a plan B.

538
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:08,500
Good.

539
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:11,252
As you should.

540
00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:22,514
NEULPUREUN HOSPITAL

541
00:40:34,275 --> 00:40:37,445
Yes, you should eat up
to live out your sentence for murder.

542
00:40:37,529 --> 00:40:38,863
Have your fill.

543
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:19,654
I'm on my way.

544
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:22,991
BAEK IN-SU PRESS CONFERENCE

545
00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:24,784
We're all ready here.

546
00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:49,058
ASSEMBLYMAN BAEK IN-SU
PRESS CONFERENCE, 10:00 A.M.

547
00:41:59,736 --> 00:42:02,614
<i>The original copy</i>
<i>that Park Joon-gyeong has.</i>

548
00:42:02,697 --> 00:42:04,824
That's all I need.

549
00:42:08,786 --> 00:42:11,206
Bring it to me
before it gets to Assemblyman Baek.

550
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:15,251
<i>Then my husband will take care</i>
<i>of yesterday's incident.</i>

551
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:24,279
Damn!

552
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:29,200
Get her!

553
00:43:35,707 --> 00:43:37,333
Where's your flash drive?

554
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:39,377
Where the hell is it? Huh?

555
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,753
Where is it?

556
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:42,922
Cops!

557
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:12,869
BAEK IN-SU PRESS CONFERENCE

558
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:14,954
When will it start?

559
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:16,706
-Gosh.
-When is…

560
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:19,208
-You should at least…
-How much longer?

561
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:20,626
When is it starting?

562
00:44:21,252 --> 00:44:23,463
Is the press conference today?

563
00:44:23,546 --> 00:44:25,006
What a waste of my time.

564
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:26,090
Sir.

565
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:33,639
You still can't get a hold of
Park Joon-gyeong?

566
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:36,059
No. She's not picking up her phone.

567
00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:39,979
What the hell is she up to?

568
00:44:53,576 --> 00:44:54,660
What?

569
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,171
But aren't you the prosecutor

570
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:07,673
who teamed up with Hwang Gi-seok
by selling me out?

571
00:45:08,257 --> 00:45:11,886
How funny.
You stab me, then give me kisses.

572
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:16,599
If you don't want to get stabbed again,
make sure you pull this off.

573
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,937
-You arrogant little prick!
-Sir.

574
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,565
Ms. Park was stabbed by masked men
and is on her way to the hospital.

575
00:45:25,983 --> 00:45:28,444
Penetration wound on the shoulder,
with severe blood loss.

576
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:30,321
She has unstable vital signs.

577
00:45:30,405 --> 00:45:33,699
Prepare an IV infusion immediately
and request CS for an emergency operation!

578
00:45:35,493 --> 00:45:36,744
Really?

579
00:45:38,538 --> 00:45:42,375
Gosh, all right.
Keep your head down for a while.

580
00:45:43,376 --> 00:45:46,587
Damn, this persistent bitch.

581
00:45:48,297 --> 00:45:50,466
Hey, Gi-seok. It's me.

582
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:53,261
We need to move quickly.

583
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:02,395
How is Park Joon-gyeong?
Is she badly injured?

584
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:05,273
-Who are you?
-I'm a prosecutor from Seoul-- I mean.

585
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:07,150
I'm her guardian.

586
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:09,110
She lost a lot of blood
so she's in operation.

587
00:46:09,193 --> 00:46:10,319
We don't know the details.

588
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:12,697
What about the assailants?
Did you catch them?

589
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,324
Who the hell would stab someone
in broad daylight?

590
00:46:15,408 --> 00:46:17,994
The assailants fled the scene,
so we are investigating.

591
00:46:18,828 --> 00:46:19,829
Gosh.

592
00:46:19,912 --> 00:46:22,582
<i>I would like to inform</i>
<i>that Assemblyman Baek's press conference,</i>

593
00:46:22,665 --> 00:46:25,042

595
00:46:28,212 --> 00:46:30,465
-<i>Why was it canceled?</i>
-<i>Due to illegal recruitment of--</i>

596
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:33,134
<i>Assemblyman Baek will hold</i>

00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:37,805
Damn!

600
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:39,974
<i>Where is Assemblyman Baek at the moment?</i>

601
00:46:40,057 --> 00:46:44,353
<i>I'd like to offer my apologies once more</i>
<i>and conclude today's press conference.</i>

602
00:46:44,437 --> 00:46:45,688
Yes, sir.

603
00:46:47,982 --> 00:46:52,653
I'll draft the indictment
so you can keep your seat in the Assembly.

604
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:59,368
You don't have to worry
about the higher-ups.

BAEK IN-SU PRESS CONFERENCE

606

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
MEMORANDUM

607
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:15,635
The redevelopment plan
that was terminated in your district,

608
00:47:16,302 --> 00:47:19,764
I will make sure to
fully compensate for the loss.

609
00:47:30,483 --> 00:47:34,111
-Better treat me to a drink too.
-Of course, sir. No need to ask.

610
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:38,616
Just give me a date
and I'll serve you well.

611
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,081
Thank you, sir.

612
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:53,256
-My apologies, sir.
-Yeah.

613
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,384
What took so long?

614
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:59,178
A case has been resolved successfully,

615
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:01,180
thanks to your patience, sir.

616
00:48:01,264 --> 00:48:02,431
Is that so?

617
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,143
As prosecutors, it's satisfying
whenever that happens.

618
00:48:06,852 --> 00:48:08,104
You are right, sir.

619
00:48:08,187 --> 00:48:10,231
How do you like the chrysanthemum tea?

620
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:11,899
Yes. It's nice.

621
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:17,071
It's nice, but about the homicide
that happened in jail…

622
00:48:17,655 --> 00:48:19,365
Will you accuse him of homicide?

623
00:48:20,074 --> 00:48:24,537
Then he'll be sentenced to
at least ten years.

624
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,455
If he admits to his crime,

625
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:29,834
he'll get seven years on his first trial,
five years on his second,

626
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:32,169
and three years on his third trial.

627
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:36,048
This is your case, Attorney General.
It's my duty to make sure it goes well.

628
00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:39,594
Sounds great. Well done.

629
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:41,762
I'm flattered, sir.

630
00:48:55,234 --> 00:48:56,736
I'm Detective Won Ji-a.

631
00:48:57,236 --> 00:48:59,739
Were you able to secure
the victim's dashcam?

632
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:01,741
They're all wearing a mask,
so we can't tell.

633
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:03,242
But there's one guy without a mask.

634
00:49:06,203 --> 00:49:07,538
Here.

635
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:13,002
Hold on.

636
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:16,839
-Who are you?
-I'm Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

637
00:49:22,345 --> 00:49:23,512
His name is Lee Jin-ho.

638
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:26,891
He has a record
at the Buksan Juvenile Center in the '90s.

639
00:49:26,974 --> 00:49:30,019
Run a background check
and put an APB out for him right away.

640
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:38,486
The guy who stabbed Joon-gyeong…

641
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:41,614
was Jin-ho?

642
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:44,825
Prosecutor Jang recognized his face.

643
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:47,662
The police put him on the wanted list.

644
00:49:51,248 --> 00:49:53,167
Can I get out of this place now?

645
00:49:54,168 --> 00:49:55,920
I don't care how much it costs.

646
00:49:58,673 --> 00:50:00,257
If you admit to murder,

647
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:03,094
you'll get three years for foul play.

648
00:50:04,095 --> 00:50:07,056
It's the final negotiation
Attorney Kim could reach with prosecution.

649
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,982
Goodbye.

650
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,543
LET'S LIVE A CHEERFUL,
AND ORDERLY LIFE

651
00:50:35,626 --> 00:50:37,962
EVIL BEGETS SIN,
GOOD BEGETS BLESSING

652
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:47,138
<i>If you lose your inner peace,</i>
<i>you cannot win in any fight.</i>

653
00:50:50,516 --> 00:50:53,269
<i>Every day, the capital market</i>
<i>is on the verge of collapsing</i>

654
00:50:53,352 --> 00:50:55,604
<i>forcing it into a chaotic hell.</i>

655
00:50:57,064 --> 00:50:59,859
<i>In this harsh, vicious battle for wealth,</i>

656
00:50:59,942 --> 00:51:02,611
<i>I always came out on top because I had…</i>

657
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:04,864
<i>inner peace.</i>

658
00:51:31,932 --> 00:51:33,768
<i>But I don't need it anymore.</i>

659
00:52:10,262 --> 00:52:11,639
-Hey, damn it.
-Let go!

660
00:52:12,348 --> 00:52:13,557
Let go!

661
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:15,601
Damn you!

662
00:52:19,438 --> 00:52:20,481
Let go!

663
00:52:24,193 --> 00:52:25,319
Fuck!

664
00:52:31,283 --> 00:52:33,536
<i>A battle with the beasts…</i>

665
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:38,249
<i>is nothing short of hell on Earth.</i>

666
00:54:11,508 --> 00:54:14,178
A MONTH LATER

667
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,069
-She's still not awake?
-No.

668
00:54:30,903 --> 00:54:33,864
When in a coma due to blood loss,
they say a month is critical.

669
00:54:35,157 --> 00:54:37,409
You either wake up, stay as is,

670
00:54:37,993 --> 00:54:39,036
or die.

671
00:54:41,205 --> 00:54:45,125
My predecessor was in a coma
for half a year and passed away.

672
00:54:49,755 --> 00:54:51,548
Any progress in the investigation?

673
00:54:52,132 --> 00:54:55,135
We put out an APB for Lee Jin-ho,
as you said.

674
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:57,554
As for Chairman Myung,
who you accused as the mastermind,

675
00:54:57,638 --> 00:55:01,016
the prosecution continues to refuse
issuing the warrants we requested.

676
00:55:02,726 --> 00:55:04,186
As expected.

677
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,522
You're suspended for three months.

678
00:55:06,605 --> 00:55:09,400
The bastard who is refusing my requests
and has suspended you.

679
00:55:09,483 --> 00:55:10,859
It's the same guy, right?

680
00:55:10,943 --> 00:55:14,154
That Hwang whatever guy,
Chairman Myung's son-in-law?

681
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:20,744
Please give me relevant information
regarding him.

682
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:24,623
You can't investigate
because of your suspension anyway.

683
00:55:25,374 --> 00:55:26,375
Detective.

684
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:29,169
You shouldn't
get involved in this fight either.

685
00:55:30,421 --> 00:55:32,464
This fight only goes two ways.

686
00:55:33,048 --> 00:55:35,009
You'll get laid off like me, or…

687
00:55:50,941 --> 00:55:55,320
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER
OF HUMANE RESPECT

688
00:56:41,742 --> 00:56:44,703
You've been through a lot,
so let's drink something sweet.

689
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:46,538
How is your injury?

690
00:56:47,915 --> 00:56:52,419
Now that you have to stay here,
try to play nice and get along, okay?

691
00:56:52,503 --> 00:56:54,797
If you get your sentence extended
for beating up

692
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,759
a piece of trash like Kim Seong-tae,
the loss is yours.

693
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:07,226
By the way,
I looked into you, Inmate 4816.

694
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,562
You're a clever one
who used to handle large amounts of money.

695
00:57:11,939 --> 00:57:14,566
If you're willing to help me out,

696
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:17,152
I'll make your stay here very comfortable.

697
00:57:19,154 --> 00:57:21,824
I'm not asking for a lot.

698
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:25,828
All I need is some pocket change.

699
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,383
HWANG GI-SEOK,
JUSTICE OF YEOUIDO,

700
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:41,093
INVESTIGATES CORRUPTION OF
TOP THREE FIRMS

701
00:57:44,972 --> 00:57:48,016
Yeouido is taking a dive
while Special Investigations is soaring.

702
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,394
Recently, you've been garnering
a lot of public support

703
00:57:50,477 --> 00:57:52,396
due to your investigation
against corruption.

704
00:57:52,479 --> 00:57:53,647
"Justice of Yeouido."

705
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,275
Do you like that nickname?

706
00:57:56,358 --> 00:57:59,444
Of course, but, I mean, it's too much.

707
00:57:59,528 --> 00:58:01,697
I only did what I had to do.

708
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,740
-I don't deserve it.
-Right.

709
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:06,702
You said you only did your job.
That is easier said than done.

710
00:58:06,785 --> 00:58:09,621
But you went up against
the three biggest security firms.

711
00:58:09,705 --> 00:58:12,833
It must have been a big burden
for you to investigate them.

712
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:14,835
-Any comments on that?
-Yes, it was a burden.

713
00:58:16,128 --> 00:58:18,172
That's why we need Special Investigations.

714
00:58:18,255 --> 00:58:21,341
A corruption case
short-selling stocks like this is

715
00:58:21,425 --> 00:58:25,888
a criminal offense that directly affects
the lives of independent investors.

716
00:58:25,971 --> 00:58:27,890
<i>Recently, the magnates</i>
<i>of the capital market,</i>

717
00:58:27,973 --> 00:58:30,809
<i>institutional investors,</i>
<i>have shown serious moral hazards.</i>

718
00:58:30,893 --> 00:58:31,977
Wow, nice shot!

719
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,188
LEE JEONG-GEUN - CHAIRMAN
OF NAMSAN FINANCIAL GROUP

720
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:35,898
Your swings are on point today, sir!

721
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,943
-Are they?
-Yes. Your swing is amazing.

722
00:58:40,027 --> 00:58:41,987
And the air is amazing too!

723
00:58:43,655 --> 00:58:45,699
-By the way, Chairman Myung.
-Yes, sir.

724
00:58:45,782 --> 00:58:49,995
About the investment product you proposed
to Namsan Securities…

725
00:58:50,078 --> 00:58:52,414
Have you already read over it?

726
00:58:52,497 --> 00:58:56,877
Our employees on the strategy team
unanimously voted against the proposal.

727
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,547
-So I don't think we will implement it.
-What did you say?

728
00:59:01,298 --> 00:59:04,843
Oh, the employees are against it?

729
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:09,181
Gosh, this is going to be a problem.

730
00:59:11,725 --> 00:59:15,270
We'll point out some of the issues
so that you can revise it

731
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:18,273
-and send it back to me…
-Look here, Chairman Lee.

732
00:59:19,524 --> 00:59:21,360
You sure you're thinking straight?

733
00:59:21,985 --> 00:59:25,489
You know the top three securities
in Korea are under a microscope right now

734
00:59:25,572 --> 00:59:27,282
due to corruption, right?

735
00:59:27,366 --> 00:59:30,244
Don't you think Namsan Securities
will be next in line

736
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:32,371
as the fourth largest security firm?

737
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:34,248
Gosh, seriously.

738
00:59:34,331 --> 00:59:37,501
But in this dangerous time,
what did you just say to me?

739
00:59:37,584 --> 00:59:39,378
Revise my proposal?

740
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:40,504
Forget it!

741
00:59:40,587 --> 00:59:43,799
I fully understand what you mean.
So let's just drop the deal.

742
00:59:43,882 --> 00:59:45,592
Let's just forget about it.

743
00:59:48,053 --> 00:59:49,429
Gosh, Chairman Myung…

744
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:53,392
-You should at least finish golfing!
-Damn it.

745
00:59:55,227 --> 00:59:56,853
Chairman Myung, gosh!

746
01:01:06,923 --> 01:01:08,675
Let's draw the line here.

747
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:10,427
Or this time…

748
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:13,055
want me to cut off your ankle?

749
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:15,932
You bastard…

750
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:25,001
<i>Is it Hwang Gi-seok?</i>

751
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:28,422
<i>The one who framed you</i>
<i>and made Joon-gyeong like that.</i>

752
01:02:28,505 --> 01:02:29,714
Nothing is for certain.

753
01:02:30,757 --> 01:02:33,009
What is this place?
It looks like an abandoned building.

754
01:02:33,093 --> 01:02:34,761
<i>It's like they say,</i>

755
01:02:34,845 --> 01:02:36,221
the operation has commenced.

756
01:02:36,304 --> 01:02:38,348
<i>It's the conclusion I came to</i>
<i>by following my heart.</i>

757
01:02:39,516 --> 01:02:42,185
If I were Chairman Myung,
what choice would I have made?

758
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:46,898
Inmate 4816, Eun Yong,
asked me to give this to you, sir.

759
01:02:46,982 --> 01:02:50,861
<i>Because if you want an obedient dog,</i>
<i>you must first teach him who the owner is.</i>

760
01:02:50,944 --> 01:02:53,613
I can send you to hell
in the blink of an eye.
