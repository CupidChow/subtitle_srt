IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

7
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:42,757
Let's make a deal.

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,970
A deal…

9
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:50,515
You have cards left to play?

10
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:53,268
I'll take the chairman's wealth

11
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:56,062
and give it to your wife.

12
00:00:58,022 --> 00:01:01,317
If you make this deal with me,
I'll make the chairman…

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,903
kneel before you.

14
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:10,952
You've seen me in action.
I'm always a step ahead of him.

15
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:15,874
There is no one more qualified than me
to go against Chairman Myung.

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,293
A deal?

17
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,423
What is it you want?

18
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:28,762
Start by immediately reinstating
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
CHIEF PROSECUTOR LEE YEONG-JIN

20
00:01:54,162 --> 00:01:56,956
I'm here to report that I,
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun,

21
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,375
have been reinstated
to Criminal Division 5

22
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,336
following my disciplinary suspension.

23
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:07,967
Jang Tae-chun.

24
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:09,135
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:11,095
Louder.

26
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:12,347
Yes, sir!

27
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,225
Don't cause any trouble.

28
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,352

PUBLIC OFFICIAL ID

31
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:27,570
Thank you, sir.

32
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:43,920
Hello, everyone.

33
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:47,882
Good morning. It's been a while.

34
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,301
You were reinstated earlier than expected.

35
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:53,346
-Congratulations on your return.
-Don't congratulate him just yet.

36
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:54,597
Gosh.

37
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:58,226
Wow. The office became spacious.

38
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,187
We have more people now.

39
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:06,442
<i>My suspension was terminated,</i>
<i>so I was reinstated.</i>

40
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:08,987
<i>As for my uncle,</i>
<i>he was given a dedicated seat</i>

41
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,322
<i>for as long as the investigation</i>
<i>needed his advice.</i>

42
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:15,201
<i>This was the deal he made</i>
<i>with Senior Chief Hwang.</i>

43
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,792
Hey, you're early.

44
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:26,421
The market just opened,
so I'm a little busy here.

45
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,091
What's all this?

46
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:34,429
FSS data and other information
Hwang Gi-seok sent over.

47
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,349
-Do you trust him?
-No.

48
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:44,230
Why are you doing all this
when you don't even trust him?

49
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:45,690
Because we made a deal.

50
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:48,318
That's why you're standing there
and I'm seated here.

51
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:52,822
Yes, for now.
But it's obvious he's going to use you

52
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:57,118
to bring Chairman Myung down
and stab you in the back.

53
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:00,038
I'm sure he'll try.

54
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:02,582
But I won't let him have his way.

55
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,043
Neither will you, for that matter.

56
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:10,840
Use money against the law
and law against money?

57
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,553
Don't worry about the future just yet.
Here's a list of things I need.

58
00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:19,641
Request these from the stock exchange
and the Financial Services Commission.

59
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:22,810
If you send an official note of request,
how long will it take?

60
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,979
My people would do it in no time.

61
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:27,315
Get ready for Mr. Nam to surprise you.

62
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:30,401
I'll bring it to you before the ink dries.

63
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,579
Jang is back in his office.

64
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:44,248
Eun Yong is here too.
He's begun the analysis work.

65
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:49,003
Criminal Investigations must be busy too.
Shall I dismiss you from the new unit?

66
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,339
No need, sir. I'll serve you by your side.

67
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:54,592
Of course, Chief Lee.
I expect you to be by my side.

68
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:55,927
I'll do my best, sir.

69
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:01,265
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS
SECURITIES FRAUD UNIT

70
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,153
Mr. Hwang.
Congratulations on your promotion, sir.

71
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:16,322
Congratulations, sir!

72
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:23,579
Thank you all. That'll be enough
with the congratulations.

73
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:27,333
This is a unit specifically created
by the attorney general.

74
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,877
The first case is essential.
You already know that.

75
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,797
Well, then,
why don't we take a look at the cases

76
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:35,133
you have all prepared today?

77
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:37,260
Let's begin.

78
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:02,285
Here are the documents you requested.
Take a look.

79
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,536
You got them already?

80
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,621
You really are quick.

81
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:06,914
Thank you.

82
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,209
I'm the one who should thank you.

83
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:11,544
What? Why?

84
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:16,382
Do you know why
I decided to work with you?

85
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:21,262
While working here,
I've seen far too many people

86
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:23,848
take advantage of their prosecutors'
family members,

87
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:27,935
but I've never seen an uncle go to jail
to protect his prosecutor nephew.

88
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:32,398
That's why I decided
to put my trust in you.

89
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,194
Thank you. I won't let you down.

90
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:40,406
You'd better keep your word,
or else I won't let you off easy.

91
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,534
Mr. Nam.

92
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:48,164
I'm so grateful and relieved
that someone like you

93
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:51,501
is working alongside Prosecutor Jang.

94
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:54,879
Then treat me to dinner next time.

95
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:09,811
According to inspection reports from FSS,
the manager of Baekdu Securities

96
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:13,064
obtained insider information
and purchased shares by front-running.

97
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:16,526
-We will root out this malpractice and--
-Okay.

98
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:18,444
I'm all for rooting out and all,

99
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:21,823
but step out the room and check the name
of our unit again.

100
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,493
This is our first case as a unit,

101
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:28,287
and you want to catch
some securities-firm guy?

102
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,125
-Next.
-Buksan Heavy Industries

103
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,961
cooked the books to conceal their loss--

104
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:38,297
Isn't Buksan Heavy Industries
a politically-themed stock?

105
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:40,466
The election is around the corner.

106
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,885
Don't you know
it'll only burden our office

107
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:45,388
if we get involved in political scandals?

108
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:47,765
BUKSAN INVESTIGATION PLAN

109
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:48,933
Next.

110
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:51,936
Next.

111
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:53,688
Next.

112
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,482
Next.

113
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,040
How about Bawoo Fund, sir?

114
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,003
Some analysts say
the plan itself is misleading.

115
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:23,092
Hey, you bastard.
Those are just tabloid rumors.

116
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:24,927
No.

117
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:32,226
Well, there are some rumors
and conspiracies we can use for reference.

118
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:37,190
But the problem is,

119
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:41,235
the fund is run by my father-in-law.

120
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:45,698
I'm the head of this investigation unit.

121
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,909
But if I investigate that here…

122
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:52,288
don't you think
people will get the wrong idea?

123
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:55,458
My apologies, sir.
I wasn't thinking straight.

124
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,168
It's fine. No need to apologize.

125
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:01,297
Let's call it a day.
We'll continue tomorrow.

126
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:04,050
But it'd better be different from today.

127
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,969
Go out there in the field and by any means

128
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,055
find a workable case.

129
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,725
-Got it?
-Yes, sir!

130
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:31,661
-Where did you pick him up from?
-The Daegu district office.

131
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:35,373
He's the one who indicted
the three-time mayor for bribery.

132
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:38,626
Actually, you complimented him
for having guts.

133
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:41,963
I remember.

134
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,006
He does have guts.

135
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,802
Get rid of the bastard.
I don't want to see him.

136
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,638
Yes, sir.

137
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,435
Look here.

138
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,357
In order for stock or market manipulation
to be legally valid,

139
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,735
there must be evidence
of unjust enrichment.

140
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,863
But you, Prosecutor Ham Jin,
whom I admire and respect,

141
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:11,242
have raided all the firms I invested in.

142
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:13,077
What does that mean?

143
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,455
The stocks crashed,
and I lost a hefty amount of money.

144
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:19,792
In other words, I'm the victim here!

145
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,085
Don't you agree?

146
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,588
Chairman Myung, you must be sour.

147
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:30,678
Despite your efforts to profit big through
a crafty operation, you lost a fortune.

148
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:34,181
Do you have more questions for me?

149
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:37,101
Let's wrap it up for today.

150
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:45,985
Stop making me come in for no reason.

151
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:48,821
Okay? Let me run my business.

152
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:51,824
Gosh.
I guess I'll be seeing you soon, then.

153
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:55,661
Whenever you run your business,
you create more work for us prosecutors.

154
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,204
My goodness.

155
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:05,838
Oh, dear.

156
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,259
OUTGOING CALL
SON-IN-LAW

157
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,604
So, how was the questioning?

158
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,814
-A walk in the park, right?
-Damn it.

159
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,694
Gi-seok must be really upset.

160
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:31,238
Chief Hwang-- He's still not picking up?

161
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:32,823
He's no longer a chief.

162
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:35,117
He's the senior chief now.
He got promoted.

163
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:40,831
If he's so great and honorable,
why did you beat him up?

164
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:42,375
Look here.

165
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,378
Do you even know how much I lost?

166
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,130
Damn, that trash--

167
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:50,674
-My goodness.
-Damn it.

168
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:56,555
He's not the one who made you lose it.
You know who the real culprit is.

169
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:59,934
I knew it. Your instincts were right.

170
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:03,521
The one who ratted me out
is Eun Yong, right?

171
00:12:05,272 --> 00:12:09,026
Apparently, Chief Hwang
and Park Joon-gyeong meet quite often.

172
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,406
And now that she's Eun Yong's attorney--
Well, doesn't everything add up?

173
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:15,366
Damn.

174
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,868
These little fuckers.

175
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:20,913
I'm going to destroy them all.

176
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,426
I've added the clause you mentioned
about Attorney Park to the contract.

177
00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:35,344
Thanks.

178
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:39,223
You sure you gave her
competent bodyguards?

179
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:40,683
Of course.

180
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:44,311
We had to pay them more than
what MLB baseball players make.

181
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:53,279
What's with the sarcastic tone?
What are you so unhappy about?

182
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:57,700
Hiring expensive security
to protect Attorney Park?

183
00:12:57,783 --> 00:12:59,910
I completely understand.

184
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,954
I worry as much as you do.

185
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:05,291
But how come I'm the only one
who cares about our fund?

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,918
I carried out all your requests,

187
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,921
so you should at least review
the materials I send you

188
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:12,923
and give me some feedback.

189
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,469
Do you even know the shareholders' meeting
is next month?

190
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:20,264
Didn't we make some profit

191
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:22,516
by shorting Myung's stocks?

192
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:26,854
Look here.

193
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:30,983
Did you forget how much money
you used to make by the hour?

194
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:35,529
You think our investors
will be satisfied with that?

195
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:42,536
Just buy their shares if they want out.

196
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,372
Hey!
Are you seriously going to be like this?

197
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:49,335
I'm taking responsibility
for the fund's performance, no?

198
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:53,589
I'll make sure you get paid enough
without issues, so just do as I say!

199
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:58,469
So what you're saying is I should shut up,
do as you say, and just get paid?

200
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:01,305
That's what you call a partnership?

201
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,976
Sorry. My bad. Slip of the tongue.

202
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,647
Damn you. You should be thankful
that we're at the prosecution,

203
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,398
or I would've beaten you up.

204
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:14,276
-Thanks.
-Did you just smile?

205
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:22,743
So did you pick your next operation?

206
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:25,329
It begins today.

207
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,878
Any evidence from the police yet?

208
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:35,047
Nothing as of yet.

209
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,716
-Please let me know if they find anything.
-Yes, ma'am.

210
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:48,394
-Chief Lee, you've prepared a case?
-Yes, sir.

211
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:51,480
One of the prosecutors
from our division found the case.

212
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:54,525
I summoned the prosecutor in charge.

213
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:08,247
Senior Chief. It's been a while, sir.

214
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:11,250
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

215
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,377
Good to see you again.

216
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:18,048
I look forward to what you have.
I expect nothing below stellar.

217
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:20,634
Shall we begin, then?

218
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,472
The case that I bring
is the case of a solution company.

219
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:28,142
Their stocks have been on the rise
for two months.

220
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,686
The company is Oaklay Inc.

221
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:38,027
On July 13, the CEO of Oaklay,

222
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,113
Michael Jang,
sold all his shares at once--

223
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:45,075
…a total of 550,000 shares,
worth 27 billion won,

224
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,536
thereby crashing its stock.

225
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,121
For the past few months,

226
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:52,499
Michael Jang manipulated the stocks
and made them skyrocket.

227
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,209
Then he sold his shares…

228
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:58,714
…through a block-deal strategy
to make a profit.

229
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:04,219
BLOCK DEAL

230
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:07,348
A block deal is a hedging strategy
where one bribes a securities broker

231
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,017
to trade all of their shares
during after-hours,

232
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,019
thereby hedging the risk.

233
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,103
Hold on.

234
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:17,274
You are aware that the block deal itself
isn't illegal, right?

235
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,861
The money you pay these brokers
is more like a commission,

236
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:22,863
so it'll be hard to issue a warrant.

237
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:27,326
Above all,
the scale of the case is too small.

238
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:31,622
It's a mere stock-manipulation case
that'll put a few brokers behind bars.

239
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:34,875
Senior Chief Hwang prioritizes cases
that are larger in scale.

240
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,502
Something big and flashy.

241
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,964
He'll refuse this proposal.

242
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:44,426
No. Hwang will certainly be attracted

243
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:46,929
<i>to this case.</i>

244
00:16:49,181 --> 00:16:51,517
If that's all, it's a bit disappointing.

245
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,479
Did I expect too much from you?

246
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:59,900
What kind of case do we need
in this situation?

247
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:02,528
A case with a story.

248
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:05,531
A case the public can easily understand.

249
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:09,493
The protagonist will be
the justice of Yeouido.

250
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:15,165
This Special Investigations unit,
spearheaded by Senior Chief Hwang.

251
00:17:21,046 --> 00:17:24,717
<i>And the main villain will be</i>
<i>the black-haired foreigner, Michael Jang,</i>

252
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,803
blinded by his greed for money.

253
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:29,096
GOLDEN BELL PARTNERS

254
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,933
Plus, the Yeouido hyenas
commissioned with tens of millions

255
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:34,768
for making this trade happen.

256
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:39,148
In other words, the corrupt brokers
will be the villain's co-conspirators.

257
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:40,691
-Yes!
-Drink up!

258
00:17:48,574 --> 00:17:50,325
-The car's coming in!
-He's here!

259
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,459
-Give us a comment!
-One comment please!

260
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:02,588
<i>The press will call this incident</i>
<i>the Block Deal Gate.</i>

261
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:07,009
<i>This case involves</i>
<i>a Korean American named Mr. Jang</i>

262
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:10,220
meddling with the Korean capital market
from abroad,

263
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:13,265
consequently affecting
a large number of shareholders.

264
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:16,351
Thus, this case differs in nature
from the usual block-deal crimes.

265
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:20,355
Starting with this case,
the Special Investigations unit

266
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:24,610
promises to penalize those who interfere
with the Korean market from abroad

267
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:27,905
to prevent such crimes
from happening again.

268
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:30,908
<i>This moderately difficult case,</i>

269
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:33,827
that may seem like
a well-planned financial crime,

270
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:39,166
will provide a clear happy ending,
in which justice triumphs.

271
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:42,669
To summarize, it's just
a bribery/stock-manipulation case

272
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:45,380
with another name and narrative, right?

273
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:49,218
I did well, right?

274
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:53,263
Essentially, you're right.

275
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:56,391
From a financial expert's perspective,
block deals are nothing new.

276
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:58,560
It's an archaic technique from way back.

277
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:02,481
However, the apes hanging on for dear life
will view this as…

278
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:04,149
…the Special Investigations unit's-- No.

279
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:07,152
-…the righteous Prosecutor Hwang's--
-Prosecutor Hwang's

280
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:10,197
implementation of justice.

281
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:35,472
That storytelling.

282
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:38,600
You should enter a contest.

283
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:41,103
Great work, Prosecutor Jang.

284
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:44,523
Submit your proposal
and join our meetings from now on.

285
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:47,401
-Chief Lee.
-Yes, sir.

286
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:50,195
Make sure Prosecutor Jang
gets the vacant seat.

287
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:52,281
Yes, sir.

288
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:20,475
SENIOR CHIEF HWANG GI-SEOK

289
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,354
So, what is it you wanted to talk about?

290
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:28,692
I'm worried about Eun Yong
and Prosecutor Jang working together.

291
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:31,695
-They'll plan something behind your back.
-I know.

292
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:35,073
That's why he's under your supervision.

293
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,326
Sorry?

294
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:39,453
We're going to use him

295
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:42,497
and throw him under the bus
if he tries something.

296
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:44,291
But I can't do that myself.

297
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,377
It'll be a hassle for my department.

298
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,132
You're telling me to rid of him
if he causes any problems, right?

299
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,636
Exactly my point.

300
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:58,555
I sent him to your department
so you can do just that.

301
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:02,309
Why? Is there a problem?

302
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:04,144
No, sir.

303
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:08,148
I'll keep my eyes on him
and get rid of him when the time comes.

304
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:14,571
Yeong-jin. The view from this room--

305
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:17,783
Isn't it worse than my previous office?

306
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:22,955
You'll be promoted to district chief
in no time, sir.

307
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:27,250
I'll move out quickly, then.

308
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:32,839
When I do, you can use this office.
Although the view isn't great.

309
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:55,237
<i>The courier is going in.</i>

310
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:19,344

Detective Kim, stand back and wait.

312
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,687
Detective Han, follow him in.

313
00:22:40,574 --> 00:22:41,742
Are we pulling out?

314
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:44,911
Detective Han, what are you doing here?

315
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:48,707
-Backup said we're switching shifts.
-What kind of bullshit is that?

316
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,667
-Sorry?
-Then who the hell is that?

317
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:00,886
Detective Kim, follow him now!

318
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:04,014
Yes, Detective! I'm on my way!

319
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:07,684
Detective Kim, hurry up!

320
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:10,437
Damn it.

321
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:50,977
What the hell? Wake him up.

322
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,605
Lee Jin-ho is gone.

323
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:55,148
The bag's missing too.

324
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,401
Who the hell did this?

325
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:01,655
Get me CCTV footage right away.

326
00:24:16,211 --> 00:24:17,337
This way.

327
00:24:28,682 --> 00:24:30,642
Are you finally awake?

328
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:38,650
The security is top-notch,
so you're safe here.

329
00:24:40,402 --> 00:24:42,445
What are you planning to do to me?

330
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,284
What are you going to do?

331
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:49,828
Untie me!

332
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:55,125
There's one thing I realized while I was
on the brink of death, thanks to you:

333
00:24:56,835 --> 00:25:00,088
Those who don't follow the law
can't be dealt with by the law.

334
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:02,757
Because if I lose that fight,

335
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:07,804
the innocent who abide by the law
will be the ones to pay the price.

336
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:10,765
So what?

337
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:15,937
You planning to illegally detain
and torture me or something?

338
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:18,190
I considered it.

339
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,317
But for you, it seemed unnecessary.

340
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:29,826
Because without this,

341
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,413
your withdrawal will be more painful
than any kind of torture.

342
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,960
No. No!

343
00:25:39,044 --> 00:25:42,297
No, no, no… Please stop…

344
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:52,641
Think wisely and tell me something useful
if you want to get out of here.

345
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:57,020
Or else the pain will only continue.

346
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:21,628
Wow. The soup is just right.

347
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:30,971
Seeing as you asked me to dinner
for a taste of my favorite soup,

348
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:33,265
I take it you're not upset anymore?

349
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:35,392
You lost a lot of money last time, right?

350
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:37,978
Not at all. It's fine.

351
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:40,146
I'm the one to blame.

352
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,523
Okay, then.

353
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,613
My goodness. But ever since that incident,

354
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:51,283
I have trouble sleeping at night.

355
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:53,451
My heart is always aching,

356
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:56,413
and I toss and turn all night.

357
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:06,339
What's this?

358
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:07,799

My son-in-law!

From now on, only make trades
with information I provide you.

00:27:27,902 --> 00:27:30,447
-To prevent trouble.
-Of course.

364
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,033
If you make one more move
without consulting me,

00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:36,286
it's really over for us.

366
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,872
Thank you, Son!

367
00:27:39,831 --> 00:27:43,001
Gosh, what's all this?

368

My goodness.

369
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:52,635
Hwang Gi-seok will gain honor
through the investigation,

370
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:55,972
and Myung will make money
by front-running that information.

371
00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:57,057
Wow.

372
00:27:58,016 --> 00:28:01,019
What an easy yet lucrative
family business.

373
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:04,981
You jealous? Should we start one too?

374
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:06,524
Our own family business?

375
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:08,860
You'll earn your reputation,
and I'll earn my money.

376
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:10,278
Sounds easy enough.

377
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,823
Let's just catch those guys.

378
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:15,950
I'll get a good performance rating,
and you…

379
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:19,329
I guess you don't really get anything.

380
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:22,874
What do you mean?

381
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:26,503
I'll be getting a competent
and righteous prosecutor for a nephew.

382
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:32,926
If we made the deal with Hwang
using Joon-gyeong's flash drive,

383
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:34,844
you wouldn't be here wearing that.

384
00:28:36,888 --> 00:28:41,101
If you made a deal with Hwang,
you think he would've stopped there?

385
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:45,105
He'd have used it against you
and committed a greater evil.

386
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,274
We're here suffering
to stop that from happening.

387
00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:51,694
Hurry up and eat.
Your ramen will get soggy.

388
00:28:53,196 --> 00:28:54,197
Hey.

389
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:59,202
Didn't you learn to buy kimchi
when you're getting ramen?

390
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:01,955
Gosh, who do you take after?
You're such an idiot.

391
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:04,207
Gosh, forgetting kimchi
isn't that big a deal.

392
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,459
Who would I take after?
Obviously, it's you.

393
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,129
Don't give me that crap.

394
00:29:10,755 --> 00:29:12,507

my son-in-law really cares for me.

But how did you know
Myung would move just as you'd planned?

430
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,134
He's a doubting man.

431
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:05,471
He never takes action
unless the information is certain.

432
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:08,725
In other words,
if we give him indisputable information,

433
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:12,562
he'll pour an infinite amount
of money into it.

434
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:17,483
How much more does he expect to make?
At what amount will he be satisfied?

435
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:20,069
What do you think?

436
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:25,408
I'm not sure.
Ten billion won is chump change for him.

437
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:28,745
100 billion is probably not enough.
Maybe a trillion?

438
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:35,710
When you first step into this field,
you think you'll stop

439
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:37,712
once you reach your goal amount.

440
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:41,799
But once you become a money-grubber,
you end up becoming the same.

HWANG GI-SEOK

442
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:46,721
You lose your goal amount.

443

Money itself becomes your goal.

444
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:54,854
So it's like an unquenchable thirst?

445

I used to be like that.

446
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,901
How about now?

447
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:05,865
I regret it.
Because no matter how much you make,

448
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:09,577
you cannot turn back time.

449
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,168
Let's make them regret it too.

450
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:20,672
Okay.

451
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,592
Why don't we help Myung create
a new goal amount?

452
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:26,928
Shall we reset him

00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,185
The chairman must be having a hard time.

468
00:34:58,144 --> 00:35:01,105
He was dreaming of making a fortune
through Bawoo Fund.

469
00:35:02,482 --> 00:35:04,734
But that dream turned into a nightmare.

470
00:35:05,526 --> 00:35:09,238
The amount they took from Bawoo Fund
was too large a sum.

471
00:35:09,322 --> 00:35:12,742
I don't think
his money could cover that loss.

472
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:15,411
Anyway,

473
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:19,165
now that I've forced the chairman
into a corner,

474
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:22,668
it's your turn to deal your final blow.

475
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,213
Hey, 4816.

476
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:29,550
If this goes well,
you can take off your prison garb.

477
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:32,845
I'll make sure you get out, as promised.

478
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:37,141
As you should.
Make sure you look after Tae-chun too.

479
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:42,980
Why don't we play golf
when you're released?

480
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:45,900
We'll talk business.

481
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:49,695
Talking business with a prosecutor?

482
00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:53,491
I'm serious.

483
00:35:55,409 --> 00:35:57,328
Don't you want to work with me?

484
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,331
Why?

485
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:02,416
You like me?

486
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:06,170
I sure like your honesty.

487
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:13,386
Just make sure you deal with
Namsan Securities. Got it?

488
00:36:15,638 --> 00:36:16,639
Okay.

489
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:23,771
NAMSAN SECURITIES

490
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:28,359
Look here, Chairman Lee.

491
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,903
If Namsan Bank doesn't step in,

492
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:33,781
we're all going down together.

493
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:37,118
I'm afraid that won't be easy.

494
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,162
Do you not know
who Bawoo Fund's clients are?

495
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:44,166
They are the most influential figures
within the prosecution,

496
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:46,878
including the district chief prosecutors.

497
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:51,340
I'm sure you know who my son-in-law is.

498
00:36:52,717 --> 00:36:54,218
I am well aware.

499
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:57,305
In fact, I had a call with him just now.

500
00:36:58,264 --> 00:36:59,682
He told me not to listen…

501
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:03,352
to whatever you may say.

502
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:09,400
What did you just say?

503
00:37:16,324 --> 00:37:19,702
I'm absolutely impressed
by the Special Investigations unit.

504
00:37:21,078 --> 00:37:22,496
Take a look at this.

505
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,045
DAILY OPINION POLL

506
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:31,213
This public poll is confidential,

507
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:35,676
but you've been gaining much popularity
among the public.

508
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,725
Next weekend, I'll arrange a meeting
with the head of the committee.

509
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:45,019
I'll leave my schedule open.

510
00:37:50,858 --> 00:37:52,485
Please excuse me a moment.

511
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:02,453
Hello?

512
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:04,622
<i>I met Chairman Lee of Namsan Securities.</i>

513
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:06,749
I heard what you said.

514
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,876
Did you?

515
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,711
<i>So what do you want to do?</i>

516
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:13,965
You think you'll be safe
after bringing Bawoo Fund down?

517
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:19,512
I'm a bit occupied right now.
Why don't we meet and talk?

518
00:38:19,595 --> 00:38:21,847
I'll see you at your villa.
I'm hanging up.

519
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:31,190
This bastard.

520
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:45,538
There are piles of dead bodies
in the chairman's vault.

521
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:47,999
Is that enough?

522
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:50,459
Now give me the shot, huh?

523
00:38:51,627 --> 00:38:53,212
Please give it to me!

524
00:38:53,754 --> 00:38:55,339
Give it to me!

525
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:58,968
I beg you.

526
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:05,850
Give me the drugs. Give them to me.

527
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:12,023
Please…

528
00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:16,235
Please give me the drugs.

529
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:23,242
Gi-seok?

530
00:39:24,952 --> 00:39:26,746
He's busy, so I came instead.

531
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:46,682
How much money did you lose
from Bawoo Fund?

532
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,768
Did he order you to ask me that?

533
00:39:50,227 --> 00:39:53,314
No. I'm not here as a middleman.

534
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:57,318
I'm here to save you, Dad.

535
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:00,905
You are?

536
00:40:03,282 --> 00:40:05,659
There's only one way you can live:

537
00:40:05,743 --> 00:40:09,246
Reimburse all the losses
with your own assets

538
00:40:09,872 --> 00:40:13,209
and appoint me as the CEO of Bawoo Fund.

539
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:15,753
Appoint you?

540
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,340
Just consider this an early inheritance.

541
00:40:19,924 --> 00:40:21,759
My goodness.

542
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:26,263
You want me to give you all my money

543
00:40:26,931 --> 00:40:30,267
so I can just shut up
and stay cooped up at home?

544
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:33,687
Exactly.

545
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:40,111
Let me ask you something.

546
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:43,781
This grand plan to bring me down--

547
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:45,574
It doesn't seem like Gi-seok.

548
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:48,494
It's Eun Yong's doing, isn't it?

549
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,501
Damn.

550
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,923
My son-in-law teamed up with Eun Yong
to bring me down?

551
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:06,512
Wow. These bastards.

552
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:09,849
Do you still not see it?

553
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:13,894
Everyone is your enemy.

554
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:20,776
Nobody… is on your side.

555
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:22,987
What did you just say?

556
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:35,875
Inmate 4816, summoned to the prosecution.

557
00:42:30,596 --> 00:42:34,183
Go get some sleep at a nearby sauna.

558
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:37,853
Let me know when you're done.

559
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:43,234
What is this?

560
00:42:45,027 --> 00:42:48,113
Change into these.
I roughly picked out your size.

561
00:43:10,928 --> 00:43:13,430
SEOUL DETENTION CENTER
INMATE COURT HISTORY

562
00:43:13,514 --> 00:43:16,392
SEPTEMBER 10, 2014
MYUNG IN-JU

563
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:25,192
GMI BANK CEO OH COMMITS SUICIDE

564
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,615
September 10, 9:00 a.m.

565
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,285
September 10, 10:00 p.m.

566
00:43:44,295 --> 00:43:46,714
Do you know anything about CEO Oh's death?

567
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:50,050
I don't believe he killed himself.

568
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:53,220
In fact, I think Myung is connected
in some way.

569
00:43:53,304 --> 00:43:54,555
"Seoul law school."

570
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,020
I remember now.

571
00:44:02,146 --> 00:44:04,398
That's what Yong used to call you.

572
00:44:09,403 --> 00:44:11,405
Could you get me a glass of water?

573
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:34,011
RESTRICTED AREA

574
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,538
Let's go inside.

575
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:03,582
We have a lot to talk about.

576
00:45:11,048 --> 00:45:12,257
Have a drink.

577
00:45:15,052 --> 00:45:16,512
Must be tough behind bars.

578
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:18,597
I'll pour you one too.

579
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,058
Sure. It's been a while.

580
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:32,111
Why is this fancy liquor so bitter?

581
00:45:37,282 --> 00:45:39,243
You remember Mukho Construction,
don't you?

582
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:42,413
Of course I do.

583
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:46,291
Everyone was sour
about losing their money to me.

584
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:49,378
Except you. You made money instead.

585
00:45:52,756 --> 00:45:53,966
So you knew.

586
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:58,512
I should've nipped you in the bud.

587
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:00,848
I regret it so much.

588
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:04,226
You saw that I would make you
a ton of money.

589
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,478
So you knew too.

590
00:46:09,606 --> 00:46:12,151
So how much is today's deal worth for you?

591
00:46:14,653 --> 00:46:17,197
I do have an idea of how much you've lost.

592
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:21,034
It's over a trillion.

593
00:46:22,035 --> 00:46:24,496
If I can get 1.5 trillion won,

594
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:27,458
I think I can put out the fire for now.

595
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:30,252
You usually round up,

596
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:34,423
so I guess you'll be needing
around 600 billion won?

597
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:37,718
I know how you calculate your money.

598
00:46:40,262 --> 00:46:43,307
Eun Yong. Meticulous as always.

599
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:49,480
If I save you by giving you that money,
what will I get in return?

600
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:00,866
I'll give you back what I took
from CEO Yoon's daughter.

601
00:47:07,372 --> 00:47:11,835
This contains some photos of Gi-seok.
I believe the reporters will love it.

602
00:47:13,754 --> 00:47:16,715
There are many cameras here and there.

603
00:47:19,092 --> 00:47:20,219
How's my offer?

604
00:47:20,928 --> 00:47:22,387
Enough to strike a deal?

605
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:31,522
A whopping 600 billion won
for two flash drives…

606
00:47:33,607 --> 00:47:35,484
This is the most ridiculous deal

607
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:37,778
I've ever made in my life.

608
00:47:44,743 --> 00:47:47,037
It's the price you pay to take down

609
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,498
the aspiring future president,
Hwang Gi-seok.

610
00:47:57,881 --> 00:47:58,966
Sounds good.

611
00:47:59,883 --> 00:48:01,885
I'll send CEO Hong to you tomorrow.

612
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:05,806
Let's proceed under these conditions.

613
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:13,939
I guess this is my first time…

614
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:17,192
making a deal with you.

615
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:22,281
No, it's not.

616
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:29,830
Because I'm not making this deal with you.

617
00:48:35,419 --> 00:48:38,880
He left for an overnight investigation
at the perfect time.

618
00:48:39,798 --> 00:48:41,758
What an opportune moment
for a night stroll.

619
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:45,053
When you're as influential as him,
you can leave prison as you please.

620
00:48:45,846 --> 00:48:47,055
That's possible?

621
00:48:47,973 --> 00:48:49,516
He's got his son-in-law.

622
00:48:51,143 --> 00:48:55,272
Have you ever seen the rich and powerful
serve their sentence to the end?

623
00:48:57,024 --> 00:48:58,984
You mean,
considering CEO Oh's time of death,

624
00:48:59,067 --> 00:49:01,111
Myung's alibi might not stand.

625
00:49:02,446 --> 00:49:05,699
Which means
it might not have been suicide.

626
00:49:07,618 --> 00:49:09,745
The chairman can make that happen.

627
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:13,248
After all, he tried to kill both

628
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:16,418
you and Yong as well.

629
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:20,672
Can you find a witness
or evidence to support this claim?

630
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:25,010
Do you really think
prosecutors would leave a trace?

631
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:29,973
But I'm sure you can do something
about the false charges

632
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:33,226
Yong is facing in prison right now.

633
00:49:34,311 --> 00:49:35,312
How?

634
00:49:39,107 --> 00:49:40,108
You curious?

635
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,489
Then give me a shot.

636
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:52,663
You said you'd do anything,
regardless of the law.

637
00:49:55,332 --> 00:49:56,833
Isn't this a fair trade?

638
00:50:03,882 --> 00:50:08,804
From the start, your goal wasn't
to bring me down, but my son-in-law.

639
00:50:12,808 --> 00:50:16,895
You can always buy me off with money.

640
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:22,901
I know.

641
00:50:24,444 --> 00:50:27,072
But how will you stay afloat,
if not with my money?

642
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:30,033
You can live without your kids

643
00:50:30,992 --> 00:50:32,953
but not your money.

644
00:50:34,496 --> 00:50:35,789
Before you got here,

645
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,167
I informed Namsan Securities.

646
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:42,129
Starting tomorrow,

647
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:45,716
Bawoo Fund will stop repurchasing
its stocks.

648
00:50:47,926 --> 00:50:49,136
Stop repurchasing?

649
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,013
You're declaring bankruptcy?

650
00:50:52,597 --> 00:50:54,599
You know what'll happen next, right?

651
00:50:56,351 --> 00:50:59,813
A market crash this big
will be unprecedented.

652
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:06,445
<i>We lost trillions, so there will be</i>
<i>hundreds of thousands of victims.</i>

653
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:08,029
<i>It will be absolute chaos.</i>

654
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,785
<i>Their cries will reach the skies,</i>
<i>and blood will be spilled.</i>

655
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:16,413
<i>Some may even commit suicide.</i>

656
00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:20,792
The culprit who brought down Bawoo Fund
will become the vilest villains

657
00:51:20,876 --> 00:51:22,502
in the financial history of Korea.

658
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:31,511
You think those old goats
who received my bribes

659
00:51:31,595 --> 00:51:33,805
will ever point their fingers at me?

660
00:51:35,265 --> 00:51:39,394
If I start running my mouth,
they'll get dragged down to hell with me.

661
00:51:41,855 --> 00:51:44,149
I will never go down.

662
00:51:47,694 --> 00:51:50,280
But you'd go as far
as to turn your fund into dust?

663
00:51:51,281 --> 00:51:53,784
Countless people will lose
all their money.

664
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:57,996
Why should I care?

665
00:52:02,334 --> 00:52:04,044
Just give me one shot.

666
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:08,215
Just-- Just one.

667
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:12,135
Just once. Just once.
Please, just this once.

668
00:52:19,017 --> 00:52:20,435
Yes, that.

669
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:21,978
Bring that to me.

670
00:52:24,815 --> 00:52:26,441
<i>If the higher-ups cover for me,</i>

671
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,237
then the apes will fill up my losses.

672
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,785
My place and my money
are in a very safe place.

673
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:44,876
Manager Eun, you've lost this battle.

674
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:04,062
I just need one.

675
00:53:08,441 --> 00:53:10,944
This is poison. You'll die if you take it.

676
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,698
What do you mean?

677
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:19,703
Of the drugs the courier brought,
only yours had a special mark on it.

678
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:30,797
I thought it strange, so I analyzed it.
A lethal dose of poison was detected.

679
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:36,928
Chairman Myung tried to kill me?

680
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,225
Are you trying to fool me

681
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:44,436
with this piece of paper?

682
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:50,859
If you don't trust me, suit yourself.
I won't stop you.

683
00:53:51,484 --> 00:53:52,611
Untie him.

684
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:45,455
Fuck the chairman.

685
00:55:12,983 --> 00:55:16,611
<i>Chairman Myung chose to destroy everything</i>
<i>in order to save himself,</i>

686
00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:19,447
<i>and I ended up losing.</i>

687
00:55:21,282 --> 00:55:23,493
<i>What part of my plan had erred?</i>

688
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,830
<i>I thought about it all night.</i>

689
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:29,332
<i>And when morning came,</i>

690
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:31,626
<i>I realized…</i>

691
00:55:32,585 --> 00:55:35,255
<i>what I had to do to fight again.</i>

692
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:43,263
Unit 54! Roll call!

693
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:54,232
-Did you sleep well?
-I need to make a call. Immediately.

694
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,651
Okay.

695
00:56:03,408 --> 00:56:05,493
<i>The morning of what is now known</i>
<i>as Black Wednesday--</i>

696
00:56:05,577 --> 00:56:07,412
<i>The largest fund in Korea, Bawoo Fund,</i>

697
00:56:07,495 --> 00:56:11,458
<i>has stopped repurchasing part</i>
<i>of its shares, worth 1.5 trillion won.</i>

698
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:13,501
<i>If the repurchase is stopped once more,</i>

699
00:56:13,585 --> 00:56:17,589
<i>the total amount lost will be</i>
<i>over three trillion won.</i>

700
00:56:17,672 --> 00:56:19,299
<i>An unprecedented crisis is expected…</i>

701
00:56:19,382 --> 00:56:21,718
<i>Bawoo Fund said</i>
<i>they'd pause their repurchase.</i>

702
00:56:26,806 --> 00:56:29,142
<i>Following the announcement</i>
<i>of the financial crisis</i>

703
00:56:29,225 --> 00:56:32,312
<i>and the shocking amount of money</i>
<i>lost by a single fund,</i>

704
00:56:33,897 --> 00:56:36,691
<i>the stock market crashed.</i>

705
00:56:42,363 --> 00:56:46,284
Has he lost his mind? Myung wants
to ruin everyone's life, doesn't he?

706
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:50,205
Well, ruin everyone's life except his.

707
00:56:50,288 --> 00:56:52,957
What? How will he get out of this?

708
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:55,168
He caused the biggest storm of all time.

709
00:56:56,586 --> 00:56:58,880
The higher-ups who received bribes
won't touch him.

710
00:56:58,963 --> 00:57:01,466
If he turns on them,
they'll all go down together.

711
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:04,886
Shit.

712
00:57:05,637 --> 00:57:07,263
My goodness.

713
00:57:08,014 --> 00:57:09,766
I'm a victim too.

714
00:57:11,434 --> 00:57:15,355
This is all Lee Su-dong's doing
while he worked as vice president.

715
00:57:17,232 --> 00:57:18,525
Hey, look here.

716
00:57:18,608 --> 00:57:22,195
How can you cover something like this
just by outing the vice president?

717
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:23,822
What else can I do?

718
00:57:24,656 --> 00:57:30,286
Should we all go to prison hand in hand
for holding drinking parties at my villa?

719
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:36,000
<i>This sort of stuff happens all the time.</i>

720
00:57:37,544 --> 00:57:39,879
Chef Hwang will take care of it.

721
00:57:40,588 --> 00:57:41,923
You will, won't you?

722
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,847
DIRECTOR OF INSPECTIONS

723
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:53,726
Hello. This is Hwang Gi-seok.

724
00:57:55,228 --> 00:57:57,564
I'll report a plan
by the end of the day, sir.

725
00:57:57,647 --> 00:58:00,275
Senior Chief Hwang.
Hwang Gi-seok, you bastard!

726
00:58:01,442 --> 00:58:05,196
If you don't take care of it this time,
you'll be the first to go down. Got it?

727
00:58:07,824 --> 00:58:10,618
I'll make sure everything
will be taken care of--

728
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:13,496
Damn it.

729
00:58:14,164 --> 00:58:15,331
Shit.

730
00:58:25,258 --> 00:58:27,385
Where's Lee Su-dong right now?

731
00:58:27,468 --> 00:58:28,595
He ran off.

732
00:58:30,638 --> 00:58:33,516
He caused this mess,
so what else can he do?

733
00:58:36,769 --> 00:58:39,397
But don't you worry about him.

734
00:58:46,154 --> 00:58:48,489
Sir, shall we finish him off tonight?

735
00:58:48,573 --> 00:58:51,201
The boss will tell us
when the time is right.

736
00:58:53,828 --> 00:58:57,040
His suicide note
and his body condition must match,

737
00:58:57,123 --> 00:58:59,500
so lock him up in the closet
for the time being.

738
00:58:59,584 --> 00:59:00,835
-Understood.
-Yes, sir.

739
00:59:00,919 --> 00:59:02,503
Let's move him.

740
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:19,395
I'll devise a plan and let you know.

741
00:59:20,271 --> 00:59:22,065
Please stay indoors until then.

742
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:26,361
And watch out for reporters.

743
00:59:26,444 --> 00:59:27,946
Of course.

744
00:59:30,281 --> 00:59:31,532
By the way…

745
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:36,621
do you get it now?

746
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:40,917
In the end, you're just my dog.

747
00:59:42,126 --> 00:59:44,337
My little bitch that guards my money.

748
00:59:45,797 --> 00:59:46,881
I'm the one…

749
00:59:52,053 --> 00:59:53,638
who has a leash on you.

750
00:59:59,852 --> 01:00:01,145
So,

751
01:00:01,229 --> 01:00:03,898
make sure you work like a dog

752
01:00:04,524 --> 01:00:06,150
and clean up this mess.

753
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:07,944
Got it?

754
01:00:34,012 --> 01:00:35,138
This is great.

755
01:01:07,211 --> 01:01:11,132
You have time to visit? I thought
you'd be busy cleaning up Myung's mess.

756
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:13,343
You met my father-in-law last night?

757
01:01:15,053 --> 01:01:19,349
You piece of shit. How dare you go behind
my back and make a deal with him?

758
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,353
You're a fool to think that I'd play fair.

759
01:01:24,312 --> 01:01:27,482
If you had the chance,
you'd have done the same.

760
01:01:27,565 --> 01:01:29,025
You son of a bitch.

761
01:01:33,613 --> 01:01:36,657
If you don't intend to fight me
to the death,

762
01:01:37,408 --> 01:01:38,910
don't even get started.

763
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:44,040
What do you want?

764
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:50,797
Seeing that you're visiting me here,
I'm sure you want to talk in private.

765
01:01:52,882 --> 01:01:53,883
Okay.

766
01:01:55,385 --> 01:01:56,386
Okay.

767
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,430
The Bawoo Fund incident.

768
01:02:00,348 --> 01:02:02,392
Lee Su-dong will be the scapegoat.

769
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:06,562
But as you know,
he's not enough to cover up the case.

770
01:02:07,522 --> 01:02:10,441
That's why I'm planning to bring
Jang Tae-chun into the game

771
01:02:11,442 --> 01:02:14,028
as the insider who leaked information
from the prosecution.

772
01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:20,410
How does his uncle feel about this?

773
01:02:31,003 --> 01:02:33,840
<i>This was the first risk I thought of</i>
<i>as I analyzed all night.</i>

774
01:02:33,923 --> 01:02:35,091
I'll be right there.

775
01:02:35,174 --> 01:02:37,093
<i>In my battle against these people,</i>

776
01:02:37,885 --> 01:02:41,097
<i>Tae-chun is my greatest weakness.</i>

777
01:03:16,716 --> 01:03:20,720
But if you will stop at nothing, what
makes us different from Myung or Hwang?

778
01:03:20,803 --> 01:03:24,223
We're all the same. Because in order to
fight a monster, you must become one.

779
01:03:24,307 --> 01:03:27,185
Is it true you're the insider
