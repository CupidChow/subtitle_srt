7
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,936
Still don't carry umbrellas with you?

8
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,699
I didn't see your email in time.

9
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:35,706
That's what I thought.
I'm sure you were busy.

10
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,419
Sorry for being so late.

11
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,393
Pour me one too.

12
00:02:58,187 --> 00:03:00,606
I wanted to buy you something nicer.

13
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,275
This is what I like.

14
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,153
I just want to buy you better food.

15
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:09,657
Who knows when I'll get to
treat you out again.

16
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,704
Are you really leaving Korea?

17
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:17,915
Yeah.

18
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,503
Why do you have to go overseas
to make money?

19
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:27,008
Earning money at the risk of jail time
means there's no future here.

20
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:33,180
Unless you suck up to those with power,
it's hard to make real money here.

21
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,812
Anyway, I won't get to see you
at your swearing-in ceremony.

22
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,023
That's a shame.

23
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:49,030
Here. My gift to you.

24
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,407
What's this?

25
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:58,289
Use this to sign papers
incriminating the bad guys, okay?

26
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:02,877
Can't you stay?

27
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,880
What?

28
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,176
I liked having you around.

29
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:14,597
Mom laughed often,
and the house felt lively.

30
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:20,436
Can't you just stay?

31
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:25,650
Well, the Internet's around everywhere.

32
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,611
If something happens, send me an email.

33
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,490
You don't have to tell me
when good things happen,

34
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,701
but when bad things do,
tell me right away.

35
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:38,037
You understand?

36
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:44,710
Fine.

37
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,380
Stay healthy, wherever you go.

38
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:50,424
Come back once you make enough.

39
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,052
All right.

40
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:54,845
Will do.

41
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,494
I live alone, so it's a bit messy.

42
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,246
Just a minute.

43
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:21,914
Okay.

WHO'S BEHIND HIM?

45
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:24,518
Have some tea.

46
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,312
Sure.

47
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:29,482
Thanks.

48
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:34,195
You've been living like this
all this time?

49
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,281
Why?

50
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:40,451
This place is too big for one person.

51
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,622
And what kind of bed is that?

52
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:47,917
The heart weakens
if the body is too comfortable.

53
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,127
Wow. You are so hard-core.

54
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:57,843
This fight isn't for you to fight alone.

55
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,429
Your mom was like family to me.

56
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:04,809
You and I are on the same team.

57
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:09,814
You haven't changed.
I've changed quite a bit.

58
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:13,984
There's something you need to know.

59
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,493
The real reason your mom passed?

ARRESTED ON BRIBERY CHARGES

Doesn't looking at this stuff all night
scare you?

62
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:43,305
I get my salary from people's taxes,
so I can stare at that stuff.

63
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,100
-What time is it?
-7:30 a.m. Drink this.

64
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:50,271
-Geez, I want coffee in the morning.
-Damn it, girl.

65
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,357
You complain
even when I give you healthy stuff.

66
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:57,778
I'm visiting your office in the morning.
Let's have lunch.

67
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,321
The prosecution? For what?

68
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,615
Witness investigation about the tech fund.

69
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,285
Attorney Jung said it'd be over quickly.

70
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,454
Give me a call,
but I might not pick up if I'm busy.

71
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:11,750
Hey, busy or not, can't you find the time
to have lunch with your mom?

DESPITE INVESTIGATION,
GENERAL SON GETS HIGHEST RATING

73
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:19,216
A cut into the shoulder.

74
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,677
A cut into the side.

75
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:25,723
A cut here, a cut there.
Something's not adding up.

76
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:28,434
Oh my goodness.

77
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,061
What is this?

78
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:32,479
Apologies, sir.

79
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:38,652
Wow.

80
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:41,989
Miss Prosecutor uses a pen like a knife.

81
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:45,868
-I'm sorry if I startled you.
-No, it's nothing.

82
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:50,998
Please capture those who wield knives
and give them the punishment they deserve.

83
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,548
Hello, sir.

84
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,426
Let's go.

85
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,680
Oh, this was going up.

86
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:17,358
I heard that my mom had been arrested
during the witness investigation,

87
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:19,276
<i>so I ran over to Special Investigations.</i>

88
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:27,493
-Sir, what is this?
-You can't be here.

89
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:30,287
Let her be. Miss Park is our family too.

90
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:34,124
This was a witness interrogation
about a tech fund,

91
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,834
but you're arresting her for bribery?

92
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:37,419
The warrant came through.

93
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:40,923
I saw that warrant.
All the evidence was circumstantial!

94
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:43,968
Okay, okay. Got it. Could you leave us?

95
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,514
First off, calm down.

96
00:09:56,689 --> 00:10:00,025
You know I can't reveal case files
in an ongoing investigation.

97
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:02,444
Take a look.

98
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:08,367
Your mother and the general were
a well-known couple during college.

99
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,660
Did you know that?

100
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,954
What does that have to do with this case?

101
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:15,499
Nothing, legally speaking.
But what if this picture gets out?

102
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,794
Including the reporters,
the whole country will babble about this.

103
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,007
Is this about General Son
running for provincial governorship?

104
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,176
If we don't respond to his threat,
he'll get us first.

105
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:29,930
"Us"? Who is "us," exactly?

106
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,890
Don't play coy with me.

107
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:36,103
The senior secretary for civil affairs
ordered this, so we're going all the way.

108
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,523
This is prosecutorial misconduct.
It's illegal.

109
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,401
-Prosecutorial misconduct, sure--
-Doing this when you know--

110
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:43,944
Hey, Park Joon-gyeong!

111
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:48,157
You know better. Why are you whining?

112
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:52,745
If we decide to dig deep, do you think
your mother and her company will be safe?

113
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,959
You're smart, so you should know.
There's still a way around this.

114
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,301
Only you can save your mother.

115
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:11,180
Don't be rash.

116
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:26,445
<i>Special Investigations prosecutors fight</i>
<i>against great evil, or so they say.</i>

117
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:28,572
<i>But not Hwang Gi-seok.</i>

118
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,491
<i>He's a businessman.</i>

119
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:34,453
He offers non-negotiable deals
with his prosecutorial authority.

120
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:39,124
I too took his deal.

121
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:45,214
For my mother.

122
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:58,310
<i>I fabricated evidence, as Hwang wanted.</i>

123

YOON HYE-RIN, BLUENET CEO

124
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:03,524
<i>The accusations made against me</i>
<i>prior to this election</i>

125
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,234
<i>are categorically false.</i>

126
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:07,945
<i>Although nothing has been</i>
<i>revealed objectively,</i>

127
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,988
<i>after much deliberation,</i>

128
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:14,410
<i>I have decided to drop out</i>
<i>of this election.</i>

GENERAL SON DROPS OUT

130
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:21,166
<i>General Son eventually gave up</i>
<i>the election.</i>

131
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:28,549
Prosecution has failed to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

132
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:30,884
the defendant's guilt
on the bribery charge.

133
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:33,720
I thereby declare the defendant…

134
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:35,764
not guilty.

135
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:43,897
We're happy for you.

136
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,400
Thanks for your hard work.

137

<i>Hwang kept his promise.</i>

138
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:11,758
The acquittal awarded by the court today

139
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,595
marks the beginning of a new fight.

140
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,641
We are going to expose the truth
behind this prosecutorial misconduct.

141
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:22,603
So Mrs. Yoon and I,

142
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:25,022
we will fight to the end.

143
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:29,109
<i>Once Mom was freed,</i>
<i>she and General Son sought the truth</i>

144
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:31,236
because it was an unfair arrest.

145
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:33,655
Yes.

146
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,408
Your mother would do that.

147
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,785
But then…

148
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,872
Hwang made a move first.

155

<i>Then why did your mother die?</i>

160
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,452
-It was because of me.
-How was it because of you?

161
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,374
Fine.

162
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:09,001
Their sins are greater.

163
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:16,383
This was Mom's last message
to General Son.

164
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,177
<i>General Son.</i>

165
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:22,639
<i>No, Seung-jin. It's me.</i>

166
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:27,853
It's raining.

167
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,772
I remember the cheap rice wine

168
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:35,110
we drank at the store near the dorms
after the student demonstrations.

169
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:40,240
At the time,

170
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:44,202
we thought we could change the world.

171
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:49,458
But now that time has passed,
I realize the world has changed us.

172
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,217
I'm the one who forged…

173
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,221
the bribery document.

174
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,518
<i>Forgive me for old times' sake, huh?</i>

175
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,439
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

176
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:15,984
<i>I'll take all the blame.</i>

177
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,541
Those sons of bitches.

178
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:18,422
Let me handle them like the dogs they are.

179
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:23,218
I'll throw them into the gutters.

180
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:32,102
They're trying to cover Tae-chun's case
with an arrest for Kim Seong-tae.

181
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:38,817
I have something to take them down,
both Chairman Myung and CEO Oh.

182
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,152
Leave it to me.

183
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:44,740
They can't be dealt with by law anyway.

184
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:50,370
Yong.

185
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:54,583
I'm going to fight.

186
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,295
No matter how steep the price,
I'll fight till the end.

187
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:01,214
Anyone on Hwang's side is an enemy.

188
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:06,303
Even if it's your nephew or your family.

189
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,443
Have you not gone home yet?

190
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:29,117
-Do you know who that is?
-Attorney Lee, who was just appointed.

191
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,787
I heard he was a former prosecutor.

192
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,957
He's called Hairtail in the money market.
He's known for money laundering.

193
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,543
If he launders money,

194
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:41,963
he takes capital out of problematic
companies and delists them?

195
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:49,596
If Myung sent him in,
it means he's trying to shut this down.

196
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:06,363
Speak.

197
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,698
Rambo's shares are taken care of.

198
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:10,784
<i>Did he say anything else?</i>

199
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:12,619
LEE SU-DONG
LAWYER (PREVIOUS CHIEF PROSECUTOR)

200
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,789
Not if he wants to live another day.
What can he do?

201
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:18,124
<i>He says he'll do as you say.</i>

202
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,127
Good job.
See you tomorrow morning at golf.

203
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:23,713
Yes, sir. Just one more thing.

204
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:27,926
Rambo says the prosecutor-in-charge
is a straight shooter.

205
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,970
<i>Are you sure Chief Hwang has him?</i>

206
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:34,182
Young prosecutors these days
are impossible to predict.

207
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:38,562
My son-in-law will take care of the kid.

208
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:41,815
Okay. I understand.

209
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:48,822
Damn bastards.

210
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:55,453
What are you doing here?
You don't even smoke.

211
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,290
Give me one.

212
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,333
Really?

213
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,336
Forget it.

214
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:16,850
In your opinion, who should we go after?
Rambo or Kim Seong-tae?

215
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,518
Who'll be easier to crack?

216
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:22,981
Neither of them will ever betray Myung.

217
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:27,027
Wait. You're saying
those gangsters have loyalty?

218
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:31,990
It's not quite that,
but Myung is their source of income.

219
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:41,666
You went to the seventh floor earlier.
Did Chief Hwang call for you?

220
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,210
Yes.

221
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:48,298
I'm sure he gave you sweet talk.

222
00:20:54,512 --> 00:20:56,139
Want my advice?

223
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,853
Chief Hwang is not one to talk nonsense.

224
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:03,605
He keeps all of his promises.

225
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:07,859
-So you think--
-Don't ask me for my opinion.

226
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,986
In the end, the choice is up to you.

227
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:14,824
I believe it's time for me to clock out.
I'm going home now.

228
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,802
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE

229
00:21:53,238 --> 00:21:56,116
-Hello.
-This is your temporary entrance ID.

230
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,952
You can enter with this from now on.

231
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:01,079
Okay.

232
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:11,715
<i>Here, at this press conference,</i>
<i>I want to make this clear:</i>

233
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:15,260
<i>The prosecution's investigation</i>
<i>against my son</i>

234
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:18,847
<i>is unjust and a political conspiracy.</i>

235
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:24,102
<i>At the previous hearing, I made my case</i>
<i>about the former attorney general's wife's</i>

236
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,772
<i>suspicions of violating the Farmland Act…</i>

237
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:30,275
-You wanted to see me?
-There you are.

238
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:32,819
<i>The prosecution's attempt against my son…</i>

239
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,822
Have you seen
Assemblyman Baek's press conference?

240
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:40,118
-Yes.
-<i>It's a vindictive investigation.</i>

241
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:42,370
What do you think?

242
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,250
He's trying to change the narrative.
Nothing new in the political scene.

243
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,710
Archaic.

244
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,507
-Let's take a new approach.
-What?

245
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,612
-Where are you going?
-First floor.

246
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:19,908
Look at me.

247
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:25,747
Baek may have taken the headlines tonight,

248
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,333
but we'll take back tomorrow's headlines.

249
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,010
Let's go.

250
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:46,309
Stand right next to me.

251
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,530
The ruling party has accused the
prosecution of making a political move.

252
00:23:58,613 --> 00:24:02,534
What do you make of Assemblyman Baek's
suspicions about the attorney general?

253
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:06,079
Baek argues the accusation against his son
is a vindictive investigation.

254
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:08,540
Can we hear a word
from Special Investigations?

255
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:09,958
My apologies to the press.

256
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,461
We cannot discuss the details
of an ongoing investigation.

257
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:16,464
Regarding allegations
of a vindictive investigation

258
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:19,008
as a cover for the attorney general,
what's your comment?

259
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:20,927
Did you say "vindictive investigation"?

260
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:27,851
All right, fine.
I'll lay out the facts for you.

261
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,979
Neither the Supreme Prosecution
nor the Special Investigations

262
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:33,773
ordered the investigation of this case.

263
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:37,861
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun
from Criminal Investigations ordered it.

264
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:44,159
Over 200 cases per month
pass through Criminal Investigations.

265
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:47,162
While working night shifts daily,
with his sense of duty,

266
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:49,664
this young man has been investigating
with persistence.

267
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:52,083
So framing this
as a vindictive investigation--

268
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:54,878
Now, isn't that what we call
a political manipulation?

269
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:00,258
The line must be drawn somewhere.

270
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:04,721
As for why we launched this investigation,

271
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:09,934
I believe it'll be fitting that
Prosecutor Jang addresses the people.

272
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:23,531
There is no justice in nepotism.

273
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:28,286
The unfair employment case terrorizes
younger generations born into poverty

274
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:29,871
and tramples their dreams.

275
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:33,333
We'll do our best with the investigation
to change this society

276
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:35,084
into one with rules of equality.

277
00:25:56,898 --> 00:25:58,274
Sorry. Go ahead.

278
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,743
WITH THE EFFORTS OF A YOUNG
PROSECUTOR, THE RESULTS…

279
00:26:21,506 --> 00:26:25,635
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS DISMISS
ALLEGATIONS OF VINDICTIVE…

280
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,351
UNCLE YONG

281
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:52,036
Hey, Tae-chun!
The homeroom teacher is looking for you.

282
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,210
You want to be class president?

283
00:26:59,294 --> 00:27:01,921
Yes. If my classmates vote for me,
I'll do my best.

284
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:07,343
Your mother would automatically
become the president of the PTA.

285
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:10,888
I hear your mother works at a bar.

286
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:16,686
I'd personally love to see a young,
pretty mom take the lead.

287
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:20,565
She's so much younger than the other moms.

288
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:22,191
You think she can take it?

289
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:25,486
They'll make a fuss
if they find out she works at a bar.

290
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:29,449
I won't run for class president.

291
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,284
Good thinking.

292
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:36,539
Your mom works all night selling booze
and entertainment to support you, right?

293
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,755
Study harder,
so no one calls you a bar madam's son.

294
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:48,384
But what's the name of your mom's place?

295
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:51,971
Teachers need to do home visits.

296
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:53,973
I need to discuss your future with her,

297
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:57,560
and if I buy a few drinks at her place,
all the better, right?

298
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,612
Something wrong?

299
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,076
What are you lookin' at?

300
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,457
This little bastard must've lost his mind.

301
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,918
Hey. What you lookin' at?

302
00:28:22,794 --> 00:28:24,253
Are you listening?

303
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,882
-You bastard.
-Wait, sir!

304
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:34,222
Sir, sir! Please stop.

305
00:28:34,305 --> 00:28:36,391
Sir, what's wrong? Sir!

306
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:41,771
Stop it. Stop it. Sir, please!
Sir, please stop.

307
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:45,691
-What are you doing?
-Stop!

308
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:00,706
Are you okay?

309
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,376
Yeah.

310
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:07,046
I'm…

311
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:14,053
sorry.

312
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,907
Jang Tae-chun, come with me.

313
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,916
Am I really going to juvie?

314
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:47,211
Did you have any problems
while you were here?

315
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:48,296
No.

316
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:51,215
Don't blab when you get out.
We're tired too.

317
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,055
Sorry to bother you, sir.

318
00:29:58,139 --> 00:29:59,474
You may take him now.

319
00:30:00,183 --> 00:30:03,311
-Put in a good word for me, yeah?
-Yes, of course.

320
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:10,067
-It's not much. Just for some snacks.
-Oh, my.

321
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,906
Yes, yes. Thank you.

322
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:25,458
Wow, Jang Tae-chun, you little…

323
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,544
You almost went to juvie, just like us.

324
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:32,715
Uncle, did you pay a lot?

325
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:37,470
Of course he did.

326
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:40,306
He basically sold a small apartment.

327
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:44,477
I'll pay you back.

328
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:47,438
Better pay back with interest, you punk.

329
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:49,524
Good job.

330
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:03,913
Listen, kid.

331
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:06,165
If you hit with something like a chair,

332
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:08,501
they can charge you
for aggravated assault.

333
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:10,545
You can't beat up a teacher like that--

334
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:13,214
He's no teacher. He's a piece of garbage.

335
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:17,260
Wow, Tae-chun. Feisty, aren't you?

336
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:20,054
You be my boss from now on.

337
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,015
How's Mom?

338
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:26,936
I told her I'd teach you a lesson,
and she told me not to kill you.

339
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:29,814
At least she doesn't cry anymore.

340
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:35,236
She cried?

341
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:43,953
We need more bottles.

342
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,497
I'm going to go buy us more liquor.

343
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:50,459
Hey, Tae-chun.

344
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:56,424
I don't mind spending money
when you're in trouble.

345
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,509
But my sister…

346
00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:02,888
Don't hurt her feelings, okay?

347
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:06,642
Okay.

348
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,227
Good.

349
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:12,898
I know what I want to be now.

350
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:15,276
Law school, then prosecutor.

351
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,986
This little punk.

352
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:19,155
Jail made you grow up.

353
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:21,532
I get nothing out of using my fists.

354
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:24,785
I'll become a prosecutor
and lock up all those pieces of shit.

355
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:28,080
Sounds good.

356
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,044
Here.

357
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:38,549
Drink.

358
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:03,324
<i>No hatred, no hatred, no hatred</i>

359
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:06,952
<i>No holding back, holding back</i>

360
00:33:07,036 --> 00:33:09,372
<i>I just give love</i>

361
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,874
<i>My mom made money selling booze</i>
<i>all her life.</i>

362
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:17,380
<i>By the time she turned 40,</i>
<i>she was diagnosed with alcoholic dementia.</i>

363
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:21,592
<i>Thanks to Uncle Yong,</i>
<i>she's at the fanciest facility,</i>

364
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:24,345
<i>but she still lives in the past,</i>

365
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:28,891
<i>living in memories of working at</i>
<i>the teahouse and the Forget-Me-Not Bar.</i>

366
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:48,869
<i>She doesn't recognize me as an adult.</i>

367
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,627
What about Uncle?

368
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:58,838
Oh, Mr. Prosecutor.

369
00:33:59,797 --> 00:34:02,133
Who's your uncle?

370
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,554
Madam Eun's brother.

371
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,222
Tae-chun's uncle.

372
00:34:08,305 --> 00:34:09,765
Oh, wow.

373
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:12,435
How did you know Yong stopped by?

374
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:15,396
Chicken delivery!

375
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:19,233
Wow. These days,
ordering chicken is so complicated.

376
00:34:19,316 --> 00:34:21,652
-It looks so good.
-When did you get here?

377
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,990
Jang Tae-chun!

378
00:34:27,908 --> 00:34:29,452
Get in here. Get in here.

379
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,079
Stop it. Get in where?

380
00:34:32,163 --> 00:34:34,290
Come here. Come. Should I go, then?

381
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,917
-Stop it. I'm not going anywhere.
-Get over here!

382
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:41,839
Tae-chun!

383
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:46,093
I can't believe how much you've grown!

384
00:34:46,177 --> 00:34:48,012
-You been well?
-I'm not a child.

385
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:49,930
Wow. Prosecutor Jang!

386
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:52,141
Tae-chun, my baby!

387
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:53,976
I'm a grown-up now!

388
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:03,986
I used to drink with your mom
after I put you to bed.

389
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,864
Now I'm drinking with you
after putting her to bed.

390
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:10,618
When you went to juvie for catching tuna…

391
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:15,456
you must've felt the injustice of it all.

392
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:18,083
I looked at your trial records
after I was sworn in.

393
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:21,003
The victim and the perpetrator
totally switched places.

394
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:26,425
I had no money or power back then.

395
00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:29,261
Dwelling solves nothing,
so I just kept working.

396
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:38,395
I'm grateful to you.
I'm here because of you and Mom.

397
00:35:39,188 --> 00:35:42,024
I might've gone to juvie, at the least.

398
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,154
Right. I saw the news about Yeouido Rambo.

399
00:35:47,238 --> 00:35:49,865
I gotta say, you looked the part.

400
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:53,410
Right. Thank you for your help.

401
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,623
That promissory note, you punk.

402
00:35:57,706 --> 00:35:59,500
I was just paying off a debt.

403
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,086
Hey, by the way,
how's the investigation going?

404
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,633
I can't give you details,
even if you're my uncle.

405
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,845
Bullshit. You faxed me a ledger.

406
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:14,014
The book belongs to Chairman Myung,
I gather.

407
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:17,059
Are you going that far?

408
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:20,229
-How do you know that?
-Because, you dimwit,

409
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:24,316
I learned the money business
from Chairman Myung.

410
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:26,402
Really?

411
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:31,866
Then what did he originally do?
How did a loan shark get so rich?

412
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:36,078
He didn't give out petty change to people.

413
00:36:37,121 --> 00:36:38,831
He dealt with corporations.

414
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:40,791
MYUNGIN CONSTRUCTION

415
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,135
<i>Myung specialized in stock mortgage loans.</i>

416
00:36:53,137 --> 00:36:56,682
I'll put up my shares
as the largest shareholder

417
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:58,183
for a two-month loan.

418
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:00,686
Gwangwoon Industrial Company.

419
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,980
Gwang for light, and Woon for luck.

420
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:04,481
Great name.

421
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:09,653
Mr. Eun, how are the numbers looking?

422
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:13,782
It'll be 15,000 won per week.
You leave 30%, we subtract the change,

423
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:15,784
the securities will be worth
ten billion won.

424
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:18,329
Ten billion in securities.

425
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:21,832
Meaning, 50% in loans.

426
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:26,378
Take off our 5% fee, minus the interest.
Let's go with 4.5 billion won, okay?

427
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:31,550
But we're not using brokers,
so why are you taking a fee?

428
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:34,386
Then come again after you get a broker.

429
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:37,181
Those kids will take about 10%, I assume.

430
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:46,899
Well, if that's the case,
can you deposit the money by today?

431
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:48,943
Don't worry about that.

432
00:37:49,944 --> 00:37:52,404
Right now, it's 15,000 won per share,

433
00:37:53,113 --> 00:37:55,032
but if the price falls below 10,000 won,

434
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:57,868
we're selling those securities
and taking the principal.

435
00:37:57,952 --> 00:37:59,370
Wait.

436
00:37:59,453 --> 00:38:02,957
Our stock will never drop that low.

437
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,084
Of course not.

438
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:09,380
IOU

439
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:12,800
All right.

440
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:15,302
It's done.

441
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,850
<i>Once the loan transaction is complete</i>
<i>and the loan is deposited,</i>

442
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:25,980
from that point on,
that's when Myung really gets to work.

443
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,780
Yes.

444
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:38,283
I have stocks from Gwangwoon Industrial.

445
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,869
Strike it down to 10,000 per share
at public sale.

446
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:43,163
-The ratio?
-You and I go way back.

447
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:44,540
7-to-3.

448
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,166
He lends them money up front.

449
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,920
On the other hand,
he holds a short selling.

450
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:54,508
He uses personnel
from securities firms to pull that off.

451
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:59,972
Short sellings mean
making money off short-selling stocks.

452
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:03,392
What is the value
of the securities you've got?

453
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:04,476
Ten billion won.

454
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,354
<i>Look into those numbers. They look good.</i>

455
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:12,192
<i>The securities firm receives the ledger,</i>
<i>then puts up the stocks for a short sale.</i>

456
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:16,655
<i>The firm posts negative report</i>
<i>and releases those stocks on the market.</i>

457
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:19,908
<i>It's a natural free fall in the market.</i>

458
00:39:19,992 --> 00:39:25,289
<i>The CEO that gave up the stocks</i>
<i>loses his mind by then.</i>

459
00:39:25,372 --> 00:39:26,623
Where is he?

460
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:27,958
What's wrong? What?

461
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:31,086
You sold the stocks I entrusted to you.

462
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,881
If not, how could the price fall so low?

463
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:36,133
Huh? Where's Myung, that bastard?

464
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:38,469
-Sir, put this down first.
-Damn it, you!

465
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,804
Hey, what the hell is all this about?

466
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:47,269
Give me back my stocks. You sold them off!

467
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,897
Will you look at this gentleman?

468
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,024
-Manager Eun.
-Yes.

469
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:54,818
-Show him the stocks from our vault.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,573
You see them here, don't you?

471
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:02,409
Let's be gentlemen
when business is concerned.

472
00:40:02,493 --> 00:40:05,037
I apologize for earlier.

473
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,706
The stock price fell very low,

474
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,834
so I thought they were on the market.

475
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:12,377
Forget the excuse.

476
00:40:13,212 --> 00:40:15,005
If it falls below 10,000 won,

477
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,591
we will be selling them.

478
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:19,259
Wait a minute.

479
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:23,388
I'll give you 5% more for interest.
Please, just give me a little more time.

480
00:40:23,472 --> 00:40:25,432
I'm just following our contract.

481
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:28,519
I need to get my money back
before your stock falls too low.

482
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:30,938
I'll give you 10% more.

483
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:33,065
Please help me out, okay?

484
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:35,317
My goodness.

485
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:39,196
Fine. I'll wait a little longer.

486
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:42,157
Don't stake your life
for the sake of some money.

487
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:44,910
-Please sit.
-Okay.

488
00:40:45,786 --> 00:40:47,579
<i>That part was true.</i>

489
00:40:47,663 --> 00:40:50,958
<i>Chairman Myung doesn't stake his life</i>
<i>on a petty sum.</i>

490
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:54,253
-I'll put these back in the vault.
-No need.

491
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:59,383
Take that to Namsan Securities and sell it
when it drops to 10,000 won.

492
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:04,263
But he's offering 10% more interest.
Shouldn't we wait a bit more?

493
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:06,098
Hey, kid.

494
00:41:06,181 --> 00:41:09,518
What am I, a beggar?
What good is pocket change?

495
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,521
It'll fall below 10,000 won today.
Throw it in, already.

496
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:14,189
Yes, sir.

497
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:26,243
So he just tosses them away?

498
00:41:26,326 --> 00:41:29,496
The counter-trading clause
is in the contract anyway.

499
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,916
<i>Once the price falls below 10,000 won</i>

500
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,043
<i>and 30% is liquidated,</i>

501
00:41:36,044 --> 00:41:39,047
<i>the stock price free-falls,</i>
<i>quite literally.</i>

502
00:41:40,757 --> 00:41:44,344
<i>Lower prices mean higher gains</i>
<i>from the short selling.</i>

503
00:41:45,846 --> 00:41:48,682
<i>In a month and a half,</i>

504
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:51,226
<i>Myung makes 4 billion won.</i>

505
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,061
4 billion won back then?

506
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:56,481
An office worker's average income was
1.9 million won at the time.

507
00:41:56,565 --> 00:42:01,862
You'd need to work 173 years
to make that amount.

508
00:42:04,156 --> 00:42:05,824
That is fascinating.

509
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:09,536
What happens to the company afterwards?

510
00:42:10,787 --> 00:42:12,164
<i>In shambles, of course.</i>

511
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:14,791
<i>The company, the people.</i>

512
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:22,090
<i>When a company goes bankrupt like that,</i>
<i>the courts take over,</i>

513
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:25,135
<i>and the company gets delisted.</i>

514
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:40,067
-Oh, my!
-What the hell?

515
00:42:41,735 --> 00:42:43,570
-Is he dead?
-Oh, no!

516
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,950
-Well, first…
-Call the police.

517
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:49,284
Call emergency.

518
00:42:50,494 --> 00:42:52,704
-Shouldn't we call the police?
-Of course.

519
00:42:59,962 --> 00:43:03,048
Who the hell is walking through windows
and not doors?

520
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:07,010
It looks like CEO Kim
of Gwangwoon Industrial.

521
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:08,387
Mr. Kim?

522
00:43:09,638 --> 00:43:12,599
Why did he have to kill himself here?
It's bad luck.

523
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:17,229
I guess the man was a goner
even before his company was delisted.

524
00:43:19,147 --> 00:43:20,440
My goodness.

525
00:43:37,499 --> 00:43:38,875
Manager Eun.

526
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:39,960
Yes.

527
00:43:40,043 --> 00:43:41,670
After you drop me off,

528
00:43:42,546 --> 00:43:44,798
go check the vault at the office.

529
00:43:45,882 --> 00:43:47,301
Yes, sir.

530
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:52,848
<i>He had cash envelopes inside the vault</i>

531
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:55,976
<i>that he had prepared</i>
<i>for those he'd expected to die.</i>

532
00:43:56,977 --> 00:44:00,939
<i>That was the day</i>
<i>I decided to part ways with him.</i>

533
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:12,909
I learned my skill from Chairman Myung,

534
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:16,872
but I had the confidence
to make money in a different way.

535
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:18,665
Skill?

536
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,794
It's just fraud and illegal stuff,
isn't it?

537
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:27,174
Loaning to corporations isn't all illegal.

538
00:44:28,425 --> 00:44:30,927
Though Chairman Myung is a con man.

539
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:36,433
You're both loan sharks,
but you are different from him?

540
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:40,270
What about you?

541
00:44:40,354 --> 00:44:41,646
Are you different

542
00:44:42,606 --> 00:44:43,982
from Hwang Gi-seok?

543
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:49,654
You do know
he's Chairman Myung's son-in-law.

544
00:44:53,325 --> 00:44:56,912
I saw you both got your picture taken
for the headlines.

545
00:44:57,913 --> 00:44:59,289
So?

546
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:02,042
Are you going to drink from his cup?

547
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:08,382
Let's make a deal, you and I.

548
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,345
I'll help you get Myung.

549
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:16,598
A deal?

550
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,268
Then what do you want in return?

551
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,564
A prosecutor who will see
this investigation through.

552
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:31,905
I know Chairman Myung better than anyone.

553
00:45:31,988 --> 00:45:36,410
I guarantee…
you'll be the one to put handcuffs on him.

554
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:42,457
On one condition:

555
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:46,586
Don't take any of Hwang's offers,
no matter what.

556
00:45:48,588 --> 00:45:50,257
That's my only condition.

557
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:05,564
-I'm Park Joon-gyeong.
-He's waiting for you.

558
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,328
There you are.

559
00:46:20,871 --> 00:46:22,122
Sit here.

560
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:24,541
Take a seat.

561
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:30,464
Is this okay?

562
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:34,801
Why did you leave without seeing me?

563
00:46:36,636 --> 00:46:38,430
You should have stopped by.

564
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:40,015
We could have talked.

565
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:47,522
I think we've talked enough.

566
00:47:09,503 --> 00:47:13,131
Don't think you're so different
just because you wear a uniform now.

567
00:47:13,215 --> 00:47:15,800
Judicial officers are like family to us.

568
00:47:17,093 --> 00:47:18,970
Chairman Myung is your family.

569
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,473
So is this revenge?

570
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,936
Can you think of a reason
why I might want revenge?

571
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:31,191
If prosecution won't punish the sinful,
someone else has to.

572
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,443
Is that right?

573
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,196
But the thing is,

574
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:40,450
if I were you, I wouldn't fight me.

575
00:47:41,034 --> 00:47:45,330
I didn't get here by running reckless
and praying for luck.

576
00:47:45,413 --> 00:47:46,540
Yes, I'm aware.

577
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:48,208
If you know, then why?

578
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:53,421
You really shouldn't start
any sort of rivalry with me.

579
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:56,758
You're an educated man, so you know.

580
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:59,844
If you get a question wrong,
you try again.

581
00:47:59,928 --> 00:48:02,681
I reviewed and previewed for three years.

582
00:48:03,598 --> 00:48:05,934
I won't get the same question wrong twice.

583
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:21,366
I'll buy next time.

584
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,544
You want another fight, huh?

585
00:48:51,271 --> 00:48:53,607
-Yeah.
-<i>How's the place?</i>

586
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,108
Yeah, it's fine.

587
00:48:55,692 --> 00:48:59,779
Hey, it's not easy to find a penthouse
with an open ceiling in Seoul.

588
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:02,532
Please settle down now.

589
00:49:02,616 --> 00:49:05,952
I'll set up a tent on the roof
if you start to miss Mongolia.

590
00:49:06,036 --> 00:49:07,704
The wind is nice.

591
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,624
But the air doesn't compare.

592
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,126
To hell with the air.

593
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:16,004
I'll buy you an oxygen canister.
Just carry that around.

594
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:19,007
That's a great idea. Thanks for that.

595
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,136
A company car will pick you up
at 8:30 a.m. That'll be your ride.

596
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:26,306
No, forget the car. I'm driving my own.

597
00:49:50,664 --> 00:49:51,748
Excuse me.

598
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:56,252
What brings you here?

599
00:49:56,336 --> 00:49:57,962
-What?
-Hello, sir.

600
00:49:58,672 --> 00:50:00,965
I prepared the model you always drive.
Come with me.

601
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,135
-Is that the new model?
-Yes, it is.

602
00:50:10,266 --> 00:50:11,309
Thanks.

603
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,896
Thank you, sir.

604
00:50:33,415 --> 00:50:36,084
-Nice shot!
-Nice shot!

605
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:39,713
Are you folding GMI completely
and letting it delist?

606
00:50:39,796 --> 00:50:42,549
It's indicted by the prosecution.
Then it's a goner, no?

607
00:50:42,632 --> 00:50:45,093
Your name's been mentioned
in the media too often.

608
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:47,846
Can't you raise the stock price
one last time

609
00:50:47,929 --> 00:50:49,764
before you wipe your hands clean?

610
00:50:49,848 --> 00:50:51,975
-Can you do that?
-Forget it.

611
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:55,562
Don't jump at making petty bills
at this point.

612
00:50:55,645 --> 00:50:57,689
Wow. Petty bills?

613
00:50:57,772 --> 00:51:01,401
This is why I admire you, Chairman.

614
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,028
But you know something?

615
00:51:04,112 --> 00:51:06,614
This case was a little complicated,

616
00:51:06,698 --> 00:51:09,033
so my laundry fee will cost
a pretty penny.

617
00:51:09,117 --> 00:51:11,911
I know that.
I've done business with you enough.

618
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:20,336
You get the corporation's work?

619
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,131
You make money,
only to serve it up to lawyers.

620
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,425
Come on, sir.

621
00:51:26,259 --> 00:51:29,471
The money I make is just a pittance.

622
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:32,182
I should have waited to become
a chief prosecutor.

623
00:51:32,265 --> 00:51:36,644
I'd have become a CEO
and have the country vote for me too.

624
00:51:36,728 --> 00:51:38,688
Then why did you drink and drive?

625
00:51:39,314 --> 00:51:41,024
Do you still gamble?

626
00:51:42,317 --> 00:51:45,612
-Every once in a while, for fun.
-He'll quit when hell freezes over.

627
00:51:46,446 --> 00:51:51,242
Anyway, you'd better do your laundry well.
The assemblymen nominations are coming up.

628
00:51:51,326 --> 00:51:52,744
Yes, I know.

629
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:58,833
Sir, there's nothing besides the car lease
and you using the company card, right?

630
00:51:58,917 --> 00:52:01,336
-I have to know--
-Kid.

631
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:04,088
I wrote the manual
on corporate investigations.

632
00:52:04,172 --> 00:52:06,591
-That's right.
-I'll be fine. Don't worry.

633
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,721
Nice shot!

634
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:42,836
Who's this? Manager Eun!

635
00:52:42,919 --> 00:52:44,712
Wow. It's been too long.

636
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:54,973
I heard you made a load of money overseas.

637
00:52:56,558 --> 00:52:59,686
-So good to see you.
-You're exactly the same.

638
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:01,563
I'm a granny now.

639
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:06,484
So what's up? Got something good?
Let me in on some.

640
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:14,492
You and your friends bought GMI shares
worth 1 billion from the chairman.

641
00:53:15,076 --> 00:53:16,619
The cash Oh Chang-hyeon took.

642
00:53:18,413 --> 00:53:19,497
What about it?

643
00:53:21,457 --> 00:53:24,294
Sell me the contract
with Oh's signature on it.

644
00:53:25,545 --> 00:53:27,839
What's up, Mr. Eun?

645
00:53:27,922 --> 00:53:31,384
Who sells contracts for cash?
You know how the game works.

646
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:34,554
What can't you buy with money
in this game?

647
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:37,015
How much do you want?

648
00:53:45,398 --> 00:53:46,733
Will this be enough?

649
00:53:49,235 --> 00:53:52,864
I bought a few bonds you ladies put up
at daily rates.

650
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,783
You want to put up daily rates now?

651
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:58,536
Maybe 1% less than you ladies?

652
00:54:02,123 --> 00:54:06,377
I'm not sure how much money you've made,
but go for it.

653
00:54:07,086 --> 00:54:09,005
You think Dongdaemun is so easy?

654
00:54:09,088 --> 00:54:11,674
You know I'm no fool.

655
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:15,386
Oh, wait. Hang on.

656
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,973
Hey, Miss Hong, it's me.

657
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:23,645
Take up all the daily rates in the other
three domains except Ms. Kim's.

658
00:54:24,312 --> 00:54:25,313
Yeah.

659
00:54:26,314 --> 00:54:29,359
Doesn't matter how much it is. No sweat.

660
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:32,403
Okay. I'll call you later.

661
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:36,407
What are you up to?

662
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:43,539
I'm wiping out the other three domains
and making them worthless.

663
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,834
The economy in Dongdaemun
isn't that great anyway.

664
00:54:46,918 --> 00:54:48,920
Not much room to share, is there?

665
00:54:49,003 --> 00:54:50,880
Ms. Kim, you should hoard it all.

666
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:57,595
You've always wanted to take over
the Dongdaemun market.

667
00:54:57,679 --> 00:54:59,764
I'll make it happen for you.

668
00:54:59,847 --> 00:55:00,974
So…

669
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:04,477
just hand over one piece of paper.

670
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,479
We'll make it our little secret.

671
00:55:21,202 --> 00:55:22,495
LEE JIN-HO
MANAGER AT GMI BANK

672
00:55:22,578 --> 00:55:23,913
-I went for visitation.
-Okay.

673
00:55:23,997 --> 00:55:26,708
How is Seong-tae these days?

674
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:30,503
He said life's comfortable in there
since you've been looking out for him.

675
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:35,008
I also got him to sign this:
the stock waiver form.

676
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:39,387
Let's see.

677
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:42,598
STOCK WAIVER - KIM SEONG-TAE

678
00:55:46,436 --> 00:55:48,104
Okay. Good job.

679
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:50,648
All right.

680
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:53,026
Chairman.

681
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:57,572
Is the prosecutor
in charge of Seong-tae's case

682
00:55:58,406 --> 00:55:59,866
really Jang Tae-chun?

683
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:04,287
You know him?

684
00:56:11,044 --> 00:56:14,047
<i>Gi-seok, good job working so late</i>
<i>for the nation.</i>

685
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,465
I'm going home now.

686
00:56:15,548 --> 00:56:17,717
<i>Are you? Just a sec.</i>

687
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:20,762
Get me some immigration records.

688
00:56:23,765 --> 00:56:24,766
For what?

689
00:56:25,433 --> 00:56:27,393
Did someone steal your money again?

690
00:56:28,311 --> 00:56:29,604
It's not that.

691
00:56:31,147 --> 00:56:35,276
There's a man named Eun Yong.
He betrayed me and fled the country.

692
00:56:37,153 --> 00:56:40,448
It turns out that
he's Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun's uncle.

693
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:44,410
His uncle?

694
00:56:45,453 --> 00:56:47,413
Something seems fishy.

695
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:57,757
He looks so good.

696
00:56:59,926 --> 00:57:02,386
Did the chairman's son get himself
in trouble again?

697
00:57:03,513 --> 00:57:05,973
My son is a bookworm.
All he does is study.

698
00:57:06,057 --> 00:57:09,018
You're boasting about your son again.

699
00:57:09,102 --> 00:57:12,939
My Tae-chun-- He's going to law school
to become a prosecutor.

700
00:57:13,022 --> 00:57:16,859
-A prosecutor is good.
-I'm feeling good.

701
00:57:16,943 --> 00:57:18,903
Let's sing a song!

702
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:23,407
Yes, yes.

703
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:27,912
<i>Long ago, from a certain star</i>

704
00:57:29,163 --> 00:57:33,709
<i>I was born into the world</i>

705
00:57:35,086 --> 00:57:39,298
<i>I heard a voice tell me</i>

706
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,763
<i>"Give me love"</i>

707
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:51,477
<i>A flower that blooms when in love</i>

708
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:57,275
<i>I was told to make a hundred bloom</i>

709
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,987
<i>True love…</i>

710
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:04,657
<i>Friday, we're meeting seniors</i>
<i>from the Superior Office.</i>

711
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,119
<i>A rose that blooms…</i>

712
00:58:10,413 --> 00:58:11,998
<i>No hatred…</i>

713
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:14,667
UNCLE YONG

714
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:18,504
<i>Don't take any of Hwang's offers,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

715
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:26,429
<i>A hundred, a hundred</i>
<i>A hundred flowers bloom…</i>

716
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:31,058
So, you're the one
who sent the anonymous tip.

717
00:58:33,186 --> 00:58:36,105
Hello, 40th class
of the Institute of Justice. I'm Jang--

718
00:58:36,189 --> 00:58:38,316
The battle of one lonesome prosecutor.

719
00:58:38,399 --> 00:58:41,235
I saw you on the news with Chief Hwang.

720
00:58:42,195 --> 00:58:43,196
Yes.

721
00:58:43,279 --> 00:58:46,407
How's the investigation
with the stock-manipulation case?

722
00:58:47,283 --> 00:58:50,953
Are arrests scheduled
for CEO Oh and Chairman Myung?

723
00:58:52,455 --> 00:58:54,415
Well, you probably know this.

724
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,500
-I can't reveal case details of--
-Right.

725
00:58:56,584 --> 00:59:00,379
The document you needed to prove
Oh was involved in the manipulation--

726
00:59:00,463 --> 00:59:01,631
I have it.

727
00:59:03,132 --> 00:59:04,842
-You do?
-Yes.

728
00:59:06,093 --> 00:59:08,137
CEO Oh is in our hands now,

729
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,599
so take my offer, not Hwang's.

730
00:59:12,433 --> 00:59:15,311
Where and how did you obtain the document?

731
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:19,941
I bought it. With money.

732
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:22,902
Damn. I knew it.

733
00:59:22,985 --> 00:59:25,988
Illegally obtained evidence
is typically inadmissible in court.

734
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:28,658
You know this.

735
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:31,077
Criminal Procedure Act, Article 1108:

736
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,914
"Evidence gathered inappropriately
cannot be used as evidence."

737
00:59:34,997 --> 00:59:37,124
There's room for dispute on that.

738
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,001
Room for dispute?

739
00:59:42,588 --> 00:59:45,549
I see you're not a prosecutor
but just a legal professional.

740
00:59:46,592 --> 00:59:48,594
We have the evidence to prove a crime,

741
00:59:48,678 --> 00:59:51,973
but you're looking through the books,
searching for reasons to disprove it.

742
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:53,975
I can see why Hwang likes you.

743
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:56,435
Ma'am, that's a bit too…

744
01:00:04,402 --> 01:00:07,238
All I want is to follow law and order--

745
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:11,784
Using the law as a shield,
capturing a few thugs to close cases.

746
01:00:12,785 --> 01:00:15,955
You'll be transferred
to Special Investigations in no time.

747
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:24,505
But I'm impressed you've made it this far.
Not that you'll ever see me again.

748
01:00:25,673 --> 01:00:27,049
I'll get going.

749
01:00:27,133 --> 01:00:28,134
Okay.

750
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:31,053
Get home safe.

751
01:00:49,363 --> 01:00:52,408
I know Myung has a lot of dirt to collect.

752
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:54,076
But Chief Hwang--

753
01:00:54,869 --> 01:00:56,912
He's a master at manipulating cases.

754
01:00:58,831 --> 01:01:02,418
He sure knew how to use your case
to shift public opinion.

755
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:06,005
I admit he's good with the press.

756
01:01:07,882 --> 01:01:11,719
Either way, Assemblyman Baek's case
is important too.

757
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:15,264
Honestly, though,

758
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:18,976
as someone with no connections
from an unknown college,

759
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:21,437
it was a hard-earned opportunity.

760
01:01:23,731 --> 01:01:24,732
Frankly speaking,

761
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:29,195
how many times will I get the opportunity
to investigate whales like these?

762
01:01:30,237 --> 01:01:33,699
Do you really think Hwang will ever launch
a proper investigation

763
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:35,993
against those whales?

764
01:01:38,412 --> 01:01:39,997
I don't care what he does.

765
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,292
I'm going to.

766
01:01:43,959 --> 01:01:45,669
Until the end, the right way.

767
01:01:47,088 --> 01:01:48,089
Okay.

768
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,300
I like the look in your eyes.

769
01:01:51,926 --> 01:01:54,261
That's good enough. Come.

770
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:57,098
Now what? Come down. It's dangerous.

771
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:04,897
High places are always dangerous.

772
01:02:06,273 --> 01:02:08,401
That's why you must get used to it,

773
01:02:09,819 --> 01:02:11,737
to be able to stand in high places.

774
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:18,369
Hey, Tae-chun.

775
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:23,040
Jang Tae-chun!

776
01:02:28,546 --> 01:02:29,713
Take my hand now.

777
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:32,216
I will make you

778
01:02:33,134 --> 01:02:36,053
the highest-level prosecutor
in this country.

<i>My father-in-law was right.</i>

781
01:03:32,693 --> 01:03:34,987
If a rookie prosecutor like me
captures Chairman Myung,

782
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:37,406
the loan shark king,
it'd be unbelievable, right?

I have just the right card
for this dirty dogfight.

791
