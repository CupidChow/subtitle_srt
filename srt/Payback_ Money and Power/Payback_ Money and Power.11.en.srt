PARK HOON
KIM HONG-PA

00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,004
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, CASES,

6
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,004
AND THE SETTINGS OF THE PROSECUTION
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

7
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:42,383
SON SEUNG-JIN CANDIDATE
PRESS CONFERENCE

8
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:43,592
From this point on…

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,139
I will atone for my past actions.

10
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:51,475
Starting with my family,
to my predecessors,

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,396
I will investigate everyone
without concession.

12
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,816
I, Hwang Gi-seok,

13
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:01,777
as a whistle-blower myself,

14
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:05,239
will fight to establish
an upright and honorable Prosecution…

15
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:09,869
until the very end.

16
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:33,017
What's your plan when you can't win
an easy battle like this?

17
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:36,353
Justice without intellect

18
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:38,898
is utterly useless.

19
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:46,155
I will use Hwang Gi-seok
to wipe out everyone.

20
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:48,574
Did you forget what you said me?

21
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:51,410
Do you really think Hwang
will stick it out to the end?

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,497
I'll be right behind him.

23
00:01:58,209 --> 00:01:59,460
He's just a chess piece

24
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:02,671
I move on my chessboard.

25
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:07,843
Fine.

26
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,304
Just do it by the law.

27
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,516
I'll arrest anyone who doesn't follow it,

28
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:15,684
whether it's Hwang,

29
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,062
or even you.

30
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:21,273
You know this already.

31
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:24,485
I may not be the brightest,

32
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:26,987
but I'm a persevering dumbass.

33
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,950
I'm not giving up until the end.

34
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,793
<i>Who was behind</i>
<i>the past stock manipulation case?</i>

35
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,465
Who caused the Bawoo Fund crisis
that crippled the national economy?

36
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:51,262
Do you think it's me and Lee Su-dong,
whose photo you saw online?

37
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,471
The truth…

38
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:55,766
must be revealed

39
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,686
by rigorous investigations.

40
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:02,314
If Chairman Myung is really
the man behind everything,

41
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:06,735
doesn't that make you the epicenter
of corruption within Prosecution?

42
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:17,496
I have the evidence to prove the facts.

43
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:23,794
We've obtained from Lee Su-dong,
the sponsorship bribery ledger.

44
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:25,713
Have you secured the evidence?

45
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,756
Which names are written in the ledger?

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,967
Are the Supreme Office seniors involved?

47
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,468
As a working prosecutor,

48
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:34,555
I will observe
how the task force responds.

49
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,016
If they're willing to investigate,

50
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:40,936
I will cooperate
and provide all obtained evidence.

51
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,410
Why did you lie?

52
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,373
You retrieved no such ledger from Lee.

53
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:12,092
They won't know what we have anyway.

54
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,639
For this sort of strategy,
the setup is everything.

55
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:19,141
You need to bluff
to make the opponent anxious,

56
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:21,518
so the public opinion flows in our favor.

57
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:25,189
But more importantly,
if we want to use Lee effectively--

58
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:28,025
It's not a matter
of whether the proof exists or not.

59
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:33,072
Oh, right. I suppose it's because
you can just make evidence as needed.

60
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,493
If you don't like how I operate…

61
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,540
it's not too late
to tell the truth to the press.

62
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:45,501
Why would I do that?

63
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,462
We put you on stage to do exactly this.

64
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,927
Keep it up, sir
Bark and bite on command.

65
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,032
"Who caused the Bawoo Fund crisis?"

66
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,660
Your facial expression was on point.

67
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,245
You almost had me fooled.

68
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,957
Good job.

69
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,418
Just as our Chef Hwang predicted,

70
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:29,920
the evening news is all over this.

71
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:34,383
Headlines about tampering ledgers,
and equity relationships,

72
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:37,761
the public's too busy living life
to follow such drudgeries.

73
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,889
Leave a strong impression,
then they'll mobilize.

74
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:44,018
I can guarantee this though,

75
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:47,354
you'd have made a fortune
manipulating the stock market.

76
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,402
Are you going to be okay?

77
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:57,614
Going forward. The other side
will have a target on your back.

78
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:01,493
It's easy to predict
how the seniors will respond.

79
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,245
If all goes according to plan,

80
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,247
I'll be fine.

81
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,416
Who says I'm worried for you?

82
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,628
You know this well.
That you might actually get killed.

83
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:19,928
Watch your back. I own you now.

84
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:45,954
You mean you really don't know
where Lee Su-dong went?

85
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:47,790
I really don't know.

86
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:50,626
I told them everything I know.

87
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:53,796
Shall I knock some sense into her?

88
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:58,258
No, she's useless to us
if we ruin her face.

89
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:03,597
Retrieve her house, car,
and anything she received from Lee.

90
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:05,432
As for her,

91
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:08,185
sell her off someplace for a high price.

92
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:11,271
Chairman-- Wait. Please wait.

93
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:16,652
Su-dong gave me this number
for when things like this happened.

94
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,903
You're saying that now?

95
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:19,363
It's fine.

96
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:22,908
-Give the bitch her phone.
-Yes, sir.

97
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,881
Hello? One moment.
I'll put him on the phone.

98
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,223
It's me. Where are you?

99
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:47,850
<i>I'm at Prosecution.</i>

100
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,394
Prosecution?

101
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,690
It's not Su-dong. It's a prosecutor.

102
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,067
<i>Hello there, Chairman.</i>

103
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:58,902
It's Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

104
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:02,948
Oh, Mr. Jang. Been a while.

105
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:06,618
Miss Kim Ju-yeon is a key witness for us.

106
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:09,454
<i>By any chance,</i>
<i>is she in some kind of danger?</i>

107
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,374
Not at all.

108
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:17,379
Good. Don't do anything to her,
even if you want to.

109
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:21,466
If you remain quiet,
I'll pay a visit with a warrant soon.

110
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,594
That won't be necessary.

111
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:27,055
You must be busy. I'll let you go.

112
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,057
Goodbye.

113
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,314
Can I go now?

114
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:43,822
Wow.

115
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,410
Mr. Nam, it's as you predicted.

116
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,413
Myung's easy to predict.

117
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:56,210
He wouldn't do anything to her
after that phone call, would he?

118
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:58,629
He's not that reckless.

119
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:02,591
He just gets clever
when dealing with the powerful.

120
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,219
Then he's just a coward.

121
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,679
Weak before the strong,

122
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:09,681
but wicked to the weak.

123
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:11,850
Same goes for Hwang.

124
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:16,647
So your uncle wants to capture bad guys
with the hands of a bad guy.

125
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,106
Correct?

126
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,358
Doesn't matter.

127
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:22,319
Once a bad guy, always a bad guy.

128
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:26,281
We have to arrest every one of them.
Shouldn't matter who.

129
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,700
It's easier said than done.

130
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,577
I've been after Hwang for so long.

131
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:33,372
I fought so hard to get him
at every opportunity.

132
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:36,708
He shattered me to pieces every time.

133
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,126
Damn.

134
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,339
In reality, trying to go by law and order

135
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,133
is like trying to catch lightning
in a bottle.

136
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:46,969
Wait a minute.

137
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:49,721
You didn't take a stand
not knowing you'd shatter.

138
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,556
If something's worth fighting for,

139
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,268
shouldn't we fight,
no matter what the odds?

140
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,478
Am I wrong?

141
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:59,564
-You are right.
-I do see your point.

142
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:02,734
I guess no experienced advice
can curb your passion.

143
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:07,572
Whether you win or lose,
do what you have to do.

144
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:12,744
I'll shield you from frontal attacks
and take care of top brass for you.

145
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,706
Okay. Let's go for it.

146
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,260
Hwang Gi-seok, that crazy fuck.

147
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:30,887
He's challenging us?

148
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:35,142
Lock him up for defamation, libel,
and disclosure of classified information.

149
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:39,646
Hwang is a clever man.
We play his game, we fall for his trap.

150
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,067
You're right. We can't have him acquire
this persecuted-prosecutor image.

151
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:46,820
I hear Hwang's wife runs a restaurant

152
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:50,073
on a VIP membership basis. Is that true?

153
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:52,117
Yeah, I'm a member there.

154
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,661
May I have the list of the VIP members?

155
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:58,707
Let me shake down a few people,
and link them to a bribery charge.

156
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,501
You want to target the wife
to strike him from behind?

157
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,420
Good direction.

158
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,630
Well, I guess that's fine.

159
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:07,883
But what about Lee Su-dong?

160
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,260
I'll do what I was taught by Hwang.

161
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,513
I'll take care of sealing his lips.

162
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:15,932
You have a plan?

163
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:19,644
Okay.

164
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:21,855
<i>Who owns Bawoo Fund?</i>
<i>Who is actually behind it?</i>

165
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:23,732
QUESTION TAKES SOCIAL MEDIA
BY STORM

166
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:27,819
<i>Since Prosecutor Hwang's speech,</i>
<i>social media has lit up in a frenzy.</i>

167
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:30,447
<i>Over 10 million posts have been posted.</i>

168
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,785
<i>According to a stock exchange tabloid,</i>
<i>a document named,</i>

169
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:38,663
<i>"X Files of Corrupt Prosecutor"</i>
<i>is spreading in the stock exchange field.</i>

170
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:41,958
<i>However, due to it being provided</i>
<i>by an anonymous source,</i>

171
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:45,962
<i>the legitimacy of these files</i>
<i>have yet to be confirmed.</i>

172
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:49,383
What's this ledger Mr. Hwang obtained?

173
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,553
Does it even exist? How detailed is it?

174
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,723
Senior Chief couldn't reveal it, right?

175
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:58,058
No way.

176
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:00,727
If he does, we're done.
Everyone from top to bottom.

177
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:03,772
Honestly, we only did what we were told.

178
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:07,275
Why should we become collateral damage
in their fight?

179
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,324
What're you all chatting about?

180
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:16,660
-Good day, sir.
-Good day, sir.

181
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:18,161
Hasn't been good for us all.

182
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,417
Here's Myung Se-hui's VIP membership list.

183
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,669
Mark one person each and dig.

184
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:32,217
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS, CHIEF

185
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,844
LEGAL TRAINING INSTITUTE,
DIRECTOR

186
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,141
Isn't Myung Se-hui Mr. Hwang's wife?

187
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,563
Should we really mess with family?

188
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:45,647
Listen, you bastard.

189
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,899
You still think Hwang's family?

190
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:52,279
The Supreme Office ordered this.

191
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:54,990
No man defeats the organization.
Outcome is all but guaranteed.

192
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,200
Stop talking bullshit.

193
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,369
Do as you're told. Understood?

194
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:00,704
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

195
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,707
Jang, my office now.

196
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:36,281
INCOMING CALL - HONG HAN-NAH
ACCEPT - DECLINE

197
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:40,410
-Hey.
-Where are you? It's almost time.

198
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:41,536
Yeah, I know.

199
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:44,831
I have to confirm something.

200
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:57,719
I'll be there soon.
Tell Joon-gyeong to start without me.

201
00:13:58,303 --> 00:13:59,346
Okay.

202
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:20,158
Where's Lee Su-dong right now?

203
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:22,327
Sir?

204
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:26,122
Hwang's press conference.
It was your uncle's work, no?

205
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,167
I have no idea.

206
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,837
If you don't want Inspection
hauling you out of here,

207
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,507
I suggest you speak up while you can.

208
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,134
If you don't believe me, fine.

209
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,763
I don't care what my uncle does.

210
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:44,683
The person who's hiding Lee Su-dong

211
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,727
is Eun Yong then?

212
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,230
All right, fine.

213
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:53,316
I know you've been investigating Hwang
behind my back.

214
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:55,485
I want a full report.

215
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,530
-Sorry?
-Your secret investigation.

216
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:02,617
I'll set the stage, now you run your show.

217
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:07,372
Now's your chance to impress your seniors,
so be the goody two-shoes that you are,

218
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:10,625
and dig up everything.

219
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,548
I'm here.

220
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:22,095
Look what time it is.
Why were you so late?

221
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,432
-I was being tailed.
-Tailed?

222
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:28,018
One of Myung's minions?

223
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:31,104
I don't think they drive that car model.

224
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:33,315
My gut's telling me it's the government.

225
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,276
81 SEO 3980

226
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:48,705
Look up this license plate.

227
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:49,789
What could it be?

228
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:53,293
Prosecution trying to dig dirt
to reel you into this mess?

229
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:57,339
They want to find Lee
by having me followed.

230
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:58,757
Oh, Lee Su-dong.

231
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:01,092
I'll alert security on this.

232
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,887
-No problem on Joon-gyeong's end?
-Yeah.

233
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:06,097
I'll go see her.

234
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:12,062
GMI BANK
DAMAGED INVESTORS' MEETING

235
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,981
The ongoing class action lawsuit
you've filed as the victims

236
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:17,776
will prove to be ineffective.

237
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,404
If you look at this example of Company A,

238
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:25,950
the compensation rewarded to the victims
after 9 years of litigation,

239
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:28,119
was only 290,000 won per person.

240
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,537
-That's ridiculous!
-What?

241
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:33,708
NO TO PRICE MANIPULATION
YES TO FAIR INVESTIGATION

242
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,293
In terms of profit,

243
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:38,004
normalizing company operations,

244
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:41,383
and resuming stock trading
will be a wiser move than this lawsuit.

245
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:45,095
That would greatly profit your funds.

246
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:53,061
Change Investment Partners.

247
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:58,066
I hear they're a notorious hedge fund
for doing anything for profit.

248
00:16:58,692 --> 00:16:59,693
Is that true?

249
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:03,863
This corporate rehabilitation project
is different.

250
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:06,825
With Bluenet's corporate mentality,

251
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:10,203
we aim to invest
towards developing authentic technology.

252
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:14,874
You aren't touting CEO Yoon's daughter
with this authentic technology talk

253
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,377
to make some dough, are you?

254
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:19,796
Excuse me.

255
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:22,799
That woman is a lawyer.

256
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:26,136
Wasn't GMI Bank's money launderer,
Lee Su-dong,

257
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:28,096
also a lawyer?

258
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:38,356
Yes, we are a hedge fund
that will do anything for money.

259
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:44,612
When there was an earthquake in Turkey,

260
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,284
our company bought
all of its glass production factories.

261
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:54,539
A leakage of radioactive materials
from a nuclear power plant in East Europe

262
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:55,957
meant investing in potatoes.

263
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,960
Earthquakes would raise the price
of glass,

264
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:03,006
and radioactive fallout
would cause food shortages.

265
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:05,633
In that respect, yes.

266
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,721
Turning a profit
is the first thought we have

267
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:13,016
in the face of tragedies,
such as natural disasters, and war.

268
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:15,977
Apologies for skipping the formalities.

269
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:19,564
I am the man behind this company.

270
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:22,233
I'm a money businessman named Eun Yong.

271
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:27,739
Then, I guess you're no different

272
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:31,242
from Chairman Myung
who devoured Bluenet whole.

273
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,705
Greed isn't a virtue.

274
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:39,542
In that regard, I'm no saint.

275
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:40,668
However,

276
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:45,215
I do not condone illegality or corruption,
like Chairman Myung.

277
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:48,760
I always work within legal boundaries,

278
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:52,096
spying out blind spots,
or using others' weaknesses against them.

279
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,350
What do you all really want?

280
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,978
Isn't it to recover the money you lost?

281
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:00,480
-Yes.
-That's right.

282
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,651
I will prove my international notoriety

283
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:08,112
by recovering the money for you.

284
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:10,323
Ladies and gentlemen,

285
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:13,368
if you want to retrieve what's lost,

286
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:17,121
participate in this project
with the highest rate of return.

287
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,707
I will restore the company
Chairman Myung ruined,

288
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:24,295
and make you all rich.

289
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:29,259
By all means necessary,
I'll make it happen.

290
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:47,485
I wanted to return this to you.

291
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:53,074
Are you turning us down after all?

292
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:58,663
What do you know about CEO Yoon's
new business plan in that book?

293
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:01,833
To develop source technology.

294
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,922
I always found CEO Yoon frustrating.

295
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,050
Developing source technology

296
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:13,761
has a price tag that knows no bounds,

297
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,140
without any guarantees for profit.

298
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:21,352
New technology, like AI semiconductors,
is what makes money.

299
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:28,443
My mom wanted to establish
a new technology standard.

300
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:32,488
"Let's win a Nobel prize
rather than make money."

301
00:20:32,572 --> 00:20:35,575
Is that something
a company executive should say?

302
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:39,370
If I want to make money via stock options,

303
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:42,290
stock value takes precedence
over Nobel Prizes.

304
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,044
Sure, money matters.

305
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:52,634
So,

306
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,929
if everything succeeds
just as CEO Yoon planned,

307
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:57,847
and there's a Nobel Prize win,

308
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,434
I'll be taking the prize money.

309
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,270
Sorry?

310
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:07,482
As I read through her notes,

311
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:09,859
the scientist in me,

312
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:12,612
that part of me felt alive again.

313
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:16,574
And as the team lead, I felt reassured
hearing your words just now.

314
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:20,328
Even if I spend tons on research,

315
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:24,415
Eun Yong doesn't seem like someone
who'd make the company go under.

316
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:30,838
You will take charge of development again?

317
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:35,426
I'll send in the details
of how much I'll be needing.

318
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,511
Anyway…

319
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:40,306
I look forward to it.

320
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:46,813
As do I, sir.

321
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:04,872
Where's this?

322
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,209
-You all came.
-Of course, it's you who called.

323
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,503
Where are we exactly? Nice place.

324
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:14,340
The security is as good
as Chairman Myung's place,

325
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:15,633
which is why you are here.

326
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:19,262
Hello again to our public officials.

327
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:25,435
Neither party will benefit
from publicizing this meeting.

328
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,564
This way. Please.

329
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:33,234
Let's relax
and have some wine while we chat.

330
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,112
Let's sit.

331
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,956
You had Eun Yong followed?

332
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,043
Yes. I confirmed with Prosecutor Jang,

333
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:53,838
I'm certain he has Lee Su-dong.

334
00:22:56,215 --> 00:22:57,592
That's not surprising,

335
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:01,345
but what do you need from me?

336
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:05,558
Public duties

337
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:08,227
have its limits.

338
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:10,521
I came to ask,

339
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:14,108
if you could end things your way.

340
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:17,820
Well, Chief.

341
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,448
I thought you were uptight.

342
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:25,203
Power really does make the man,
doesn't it?

343
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,663
Indeed, power makes the man.

344
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:38,424
If this goes well,
I'll lift your travel ban

345
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:42,178
and assist your international
business ventures.

346
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,141
Sounds good.

347
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,938
I will take good care of you too.

348
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:56,067
The thing is, though…

349
00:23:58,027 --> 00:24:00,446
both Eun Yong and Gi-seok

350
00:24:01,823 --> 00:24:04,909
are exceptional at using their wiles.

351
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:07,745
We must prepare for that.

352
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,336
Honestly,

353
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,464
being in between sides isn't easy.

354
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:21,759
You know what the Supreme Office
told us to do?

355
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:25,680
-Sir, do we really need to--
-What?

356
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:29,976
-What can't we say? We're here, no?
-They tell you to search my wife?

357
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,521
To pin her down
for bribing her VIP members?

358
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,273
You knew?

359
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:38,025
We predicted it from the beginning.

360
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,610
Our senior chief here,

361
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,238
is a veteran strategist after all.

362
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:47,118
Who cares about the top brass
who only gives orders?

363
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:48,703
What's really important is,

364
00:24:49,912 --> 00:24:52,123
our dear prosecutors gathered here today,

365
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,711
whose side are you on?

366
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,844
I plan to turn the tables.

367
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:06,929
What do you all think?

368
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,477
This reform will turn the tables
and wipe the rotten fuckers upstairs.

369
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:17,356
Do you have what it takes to join me?

370
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,969
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

371
00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:59,023
I knew it.

372
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:00,524
I knew you'd be here.

373
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:03,653
Why're you here at this hour?

374
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:07,615
Didn't you ignore my cry for help earlier
just to leave on the hour?

375
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:17,333
Of course,
I came because I thought of you.

376
00:26:22,463 --> 00:26:23,673
Cheers.

377
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,468
You going to submit the report on Hwang?

378
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:30,429
I know you're not cool
with Chief Lee's order.

379
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,723
But I still need to do as told.

380
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:36,394
Why do you think he needs your report?

381
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:40,982
He wants to use you as a human shield,
while he investigates Hwang.

382
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:42,483
Doesn't matter.

383
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:45,528
We said we'd do what we must do
with no excuses.

384
00:26:46,112 --> 00:26:48,281
I meant, don't bow into pressure.

385
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:50,741
Not that you just
ram into things recklessly.

386
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:52,535
You'll only be taken advantage of.

387
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:55,329
Mr. Nam, I understand your point.

388
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:57,915
But you said to make my own choice.

389
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:01,752
No. This time,
I'm deterring you from your choice.

390
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:03,129
I don't want you to get hurt.

391
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,218
Fast-paced investigations
aren't everything.

392
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:12,221
If this is bad timing,
you need to learn to wait.

393
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,245
-Hi.
-Hi!

394
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:39,040
Oh, my God!

395
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:42,168
Those are expensive wines.
How many bottles did you empty?

396
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:43,753
I think I'm going to die.

397
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:48,841
Those fools really know how to drink.

398
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,427
-Is it mine? Thank you.
-Yeah.

399
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:58,726
When it comes to drinking,
these Korean prosecutors

400
00:27:59,352 --> 00:28:02,063
might have a one up
on Mongolian wrestlers.

401
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:07,401
Oh, Mongolia. You got a call from
the Ministry of Economy and Development.

402
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,778
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

403
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,279
They want to know when you're coming.

404
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:14,200
I believe they'll lift the restrictions
as you predicted.

405
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:16,827
But you'll need to have a drink
with them anyway.

406
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:20,122
-Oh, my God.
-Come on.

407
00:28:20,706 --> 00:28:24,335
Remember how much money
is invested into those lands, Mr. CEO?

408
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:28,547
Oh, boy.

409
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:34,887
Yes.

410
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,222
How's the hangover?

411
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:38,015
<i>Nothing I can't handle.</i>

412
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,935
Coffee is my hangover cure.

413
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:42,937
We're on our way there.

414
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:45,064
Oh, really?

415
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:47,191
Okay, I'll be there soon.

416
00:28:47,983 --> 00:28:49,026
Yeah.

417
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:57,410
-We keeping to the schedule?
-Yes.

418
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:03,499
Let me ask one thing,
since we're a team now.

419
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,626
Eun Yong,

420
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:08,796
why's he going this far?

421
00:29:10,297 --> 00:29:13,551
This is your mother's legacy,
so I'm not questioning your motive.

422
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:18,764
But he's staking his fortune for someone
who helped him out in the past.

423
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:21,350
It defies common sense.

424
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:24,562
I don't expect you to understand.

425
00:29:27,773 --> 00:29:29,900
Is there something I'm not getting here?

426
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:32,945
Something you won't get in your lifetime.

427
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:36,615
The heart that never forgets for life.

428
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:41,245
So I suggest you do what you're told.

429
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:44,123
Don't assume for one minute
we're on the same team.

430
00:30:07,229 --> 00:30:10,691
Government vehicle's tailing me
well enough.

431
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,488
Hey, my car has a sensitive gas pedal.

432
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:18,324
Careful not to get a speeding ticket,
okay?

433
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:19,825
Which car was it again?

434
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:23,245
Oh, wait. I found it.

435
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:26,165
Okay, I'll call you soon.

436
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,010
Tail him.

437
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:02,993
CHIEF PROSECUTOR LEE YEONG-JIN

438
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,037
-Yes.
-<i>Chief Lee.</i>

439
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,247
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

440
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,790
How can I help you?

441
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:12,294
It seems Eun Yong
is indeed driving a different car.

442
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:13,379
Is that so?

443
00:31:13,462 --> 00:31:16,048
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>if you want to catch up to his wiles,</i>

444
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:19,134
you have to be two, three steps ahead.

445
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:22,304
I believe you'll have him taken care of?

446
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:23,430
<i>Of course.</i>

447
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,561
Let's just discuss future business plans
when we meet tonight.

448
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:29,937
Please let me know.

449
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:07,576
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

450
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,086
Hey, find him at all costs.

451
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:18,295
Run!

452
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,428
Is he not there? Is he?

453
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:58,252
Myung send you guys?

454
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:04,091
How come our dear chairman
never fails my prediction?

455
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:16,562
I suggest you drop those things.

456
00:34:17,813 --> 00:34:19,898
If you're caught using them on camera,

457
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,776
it'll double your sentence.

458
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:29,241
Damn it. Get him!

459
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:44,089
<i>This morning,</i>

460
00:34:44,673 --> 00:34:46,425
<i>unidentified assailants,</i>

461
00:34:46,508 --> 00:34:50,262
attempted to murder
a key witness in this incident.

462
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:53,515
We believe them to be mobsters
hired by Chairman Myung In-ju.

463
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:58,604
Although we need a thorough investigation
to ascertain further details,

464
00:34:59,188 --> 00:35:02,608
judging by Chairman Myung's collusive
relations with the current task force.

465
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:04,610
Their will to investigate is questionable.

466
00:35:04,693 --> 00:35:06,487
Where is Lee Su-dong currently?

467
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,322
Is he still in hiding?

468
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:11,033
Lee Su-dong will turn himself in…

469
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,661
to Prosecution today.

470
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:28,509
It's Lee Su-dong.

471
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:45,275
-Mr. Lee, how do you feel right now?
-Give us a comment.

472
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:50,155
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE

473
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,281
Good day.

474
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm Park Joon-gyeong, Mr. Lee's attorney.

475
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:10,551
Before he turns himself in,

476
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:13,303
he will partially disclose
the bribery ledger,

477
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,681
which will be submitted as evidence
to uphold a fair probe.

478
00:36:16,181 --> 00:36:18,100
Task force lead, Chief Lee Yeong-jin.

479

Here are the bribery payments he received.

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
LEE YEONG-JIN (29TH CLASS)

481
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:47,129
-Senior Chief, good day.
-Good day.

482
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:50,132
-Shall we go in?
-Let's.

483
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:52,342
Senior Chief Hwang, how will you proceed?

484
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:55,470
-Senior Chief, one word.
-Where's this investigation going?

485
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:59,099
-Senior Chief Hwang, just one comment.
-Give us something.

486
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:01,018
-Senior Chief Hwang.
-Senior Chief.

487
00:37:15,824 --> 00:37:17,200
You idiot!

488
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:19,953
How the hell did this get so messy?

489
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:22,748
How will this make Prosecution look?

490
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:25,083
Apologies. I take full responsibility--

491
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,836
Take responsibility for what?
How, exactly?

492
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,341
You can't go in there--

493
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:36,136
What the hell is this about?

494
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,805
How dare you barge in here?
Know your place!

495
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:45,687
We, the task force, propose
that Chief Lee be relieved of his post

496
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:49,107
for taking bribes and applying
unlawful pressure upon the team.

497
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:50,525
What?

498
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:06,667
Hey, Hwang Gi-seok.

499
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,169
What the hell do you think you're doing?

500
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:10,921
May I have a cup of tea?

501
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:15,300
-We've things to discuss in private.
-Hey, Hwang.

502
00:38:15,968 --> 00:38:17,928
Have you lost your mind, bastard?

503
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:32,985
Everyone get out, except for Hwang.

504
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:36,238
-Attorney General--
-Everyone, out!

505
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:52,838
Did you have to let things run amok?

506
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,966
Would you rather the Prosecution implode?

507
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:00,137
After cutting out the rotten parts,

508
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,638
I'll end the surgery.

509
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,561
Those old foxes won't budge.

510
00:39:08,186 --> 00:39:09,813
You think you'll succeed?

511
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:12,899
Sure, they'll lose their titles,

512
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:18,405
but if we treat them with courtesy,
they'll have no choice but to follow.

513
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:28,832
Your skills do surpass any of them, but--

514
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:29,958
Sir.

515
00:39:31,084 --> 00:39:35,213
Handing over the reins to some nobody
from the Supreme Office will damn us all.

516
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:40,343
I'm still family,

517
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:43,638
so I'll end things without a hitch.

518
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:55,317
I understand Myung's the real mastermind
behind the Bawoo Fund incident,

519
00:39:56,276 --> 00:39:59,071
but it's hard for me to accept
you have no connections

520
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:01,907
to Hwang at all.

521
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:05,368
The burden of proof is on you now.

522
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:08,163
Our evidence and testimony
will remain the same on the stand.

523
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,681
Good work.

524
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,730
As of today, the Special Task Force…

525
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,026
is under my command.

526
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:40,695
Senior Chief Hwang!

527
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:44,658
-Congratulations on your reinstatement!
-Congratulations!

528
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:52,666
Wow, it worked.

529
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,085
It worked for sure.

530
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:57,045
Wow.

531
00:40:58,213 --> 00:41:01,258
Wow, Hwang just did the impossible.

532
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,262
Hey, Jang.

533
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:07,639
The tables have turned.

534
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,767
Come over to our side.
Let's make this easy for us both.

535
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:15,981
I'll save the most details for you,

536
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:18,150
so you get the exclusive, okay?

537
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:23,405
If you don't want to be charged
with contempt, be quiet and sit down.

538
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:33,748
I don't think it's a bad suggestion.

539
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:40,881
I see,

540
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:43,925
you really have become a monster.

541
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:47,596
Because I have to win this time.

542
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:50,140
Is this the type of justice

543
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:52,601
you wanted?

544
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:56,354
Well, I'm not a prosecutor anymore.

545
00:42:29,888 --> 00:42:32,224
<i>Yong gave this to me</i>
<i>before he left for Mongolia.</i>

546
00:42:32,307 --> 00:42:35,227
He told me to use this pen to sign papers

547
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,979
incriminating the bad guys.

548
00:42:38,063 --> 00:42:40,106
So, why are you giving this to me?

549
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,068
I'm a co-conspirator
in Hwang's evidence fabrication case.

550
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:45,111
I can't be a prosecutor anymore.

551
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:48,907
I wish you the best,

00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,324
So have you changed your mind?

556
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:36,121
I was told to submit this report by today.

You've gotten stylish too.

565
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:11,906
But it seems
you've gotten worse at reading the room.

566
00:44:13,074 --> 00:44:15,160
I found no such clause
in the Prosecutors' Office Act,

567
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,704
under Duties of Prosecutors.

You think this is enough?

00:44:49,944 --> 00:44:51,780
The investigators will arrive soon.

576
00:44:52,447 --> 00:44:55,033
Why don't you go into your room
and give it some thought?

577
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:00,080
What is it you two want?

578
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:02,290
Revenge or something?

579
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:05,710
Money, of course.

580
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:08,713
What do you have besides money?

581
00:45:09,464 --> 00:45:12,092
If you leave everything in my name,

582
00:45:13,385 --> 00:45:16,137
I'll make sure you'll get medical parole.

583
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,976
Don't look at me like that.

584
00:45:22,477 --> 00:45:25,397
I'm only taking the money
because you are my dad.

585
00:45:26,981 --> 00:45:30,902
If it were anyone else,
I wouldn't end here.

you have the right to remain silent.

Anything you say can and will be used

You have the right to an attorney.

593

Senior Chief Hwang, let's talk.

594
00:46:22,328 --> 00:46:25,248
Are you really doing this to me, huh?

595

Hey, Hwang Gi-seok. Hey!

Okay.

Think we found everything
under his borrowed-name accounts.

610
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,281
Agreed.

This would have taken months
for my team to interpret.

616
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:55,463
Pay me a handsome advisory fee.

617

I'd be happy to use my talents

No, no.

Never mind that.

621
00:48:06,224 --> 00:48:09,477
I'll redeem all of Myung's secret funds

Oh, sure.

Don't worry about Tae-chun.

631
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:40,633
Just finish what I told you to do, okay?

632
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:43,344
Sure.

633
00:48:53,605 --> 00:48:56,983
Tae-chun was left in the dust,
and Hwang went up another level.

634
00:48:59,068 --> 00:49:01,029
You going to be okay with Hwang?

635
00:49:01,863 --> 00:49:04,616
So far, he's doing everything as told.

636
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,786
Now that I've moved him up,

637
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,706
I'll have to watch him
and find out what he's really after.

638
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,627
Was it too much for Tae-chun after all?

639
00:49:20,298 --> 00:49:24,552
What we needed thus far, was a prosecutor
who would use any means for a goal.

640
00:49:24,636 --> 00:49:26,596
Someone who works like a hedge fund.

641
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:31,476
Compared to Hwang,
Jang isn't a salesman but a fighter.

642
00:49:32,352 --> 00:49:33,978
He pursues without calculation.

643
00:49:35,647 --> 00:49:38,691
He's still just a pawn,
the weakest piece on the chessboard.

644
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,027
I'm not sure if he'll last until the end.

645
00:49:44,906 --> 00:49:46,449
I hope he perseveres.

646
00:49:50,953 --> 00:49:54,374
<i>In Mongolian chess,</i>
<i>there is a unique rule.</i>

647
00:49:58,044 --> 00:50:02,423
<i>While the pawn is the weakest piece,</i>
<i>which can only move one square at a time,</i>

648
00:50:02,507 --> 00:50:04,300
<i>once it reaches the other side,</i>

649
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:09,597
<i>it can move left, right, and wherever,</i>
<i>becoming the strongest piece in the game.</i>

650
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:18,439
<i>Whether he can survive this war</i>
<i>where only the strong survive</i>

651
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:21,275
<i>is now</i>

652
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:23,277
<i>entirely up to Tae-chun.</i>

653
00:50:25,863 --> 00:50:26,864
COMPLAINT

654
00:50:26,948 --> 00:50:28,991
Ms. Kim Bok-sun,
you're a Dongdaemun investor.

655
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:33,413
You want to sue Chairman Myung
and Prosecutor Hwang?

656
00:50:34,497 --> 00:50:38,251
That man and his son-in-law
work together to commit fraud.

657
00:50:40,086 --> 00:50:43,381
But why, of all people,
have you come to me?

658
00:50:44,882 --> 00:50:48,052
Because you arrested
the almighty Chairman Myung.

659
00:50:50,513 --> 00:50:54,058
When you arrested him a while back,

660
00:50:54,142 --> 00:50:56,644
Myung told me to come see him in prison.

661
00:50:56,728 --> 00:50:59,480
It was so sudden, so I went to see him.

662
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:02,775
<i>And he told me to sue him out of the blue.</i>

663
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,444
You want me to sue you?

664
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:08,489
Bok-sun, if you sue me…

665
00:51:12,118 --> 00:51:14,328
I'll return your Dongdaemun shares.

666
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:18,124
<i>So, she sued him like he asked.</i>

667
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:19,208
STATEMENT

668
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:21,919
<i>But when Myung was released,</i>
<i>not only did he not return her shares,</i>

669
00:51:22,003 --> 00:51:25,590
but he had Hwang indict her for libel.

670
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,052
Hwang looking out for Myung
is a common pattern.

671
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,098
Didn't you mention a while back,

672
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:37,477
Joon-gyeong wanted security footage
from Eastern District?

673
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,687
Yeah, she thought it was strange

674
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:43,065
<i>that CEO Oh died around the time</i>
<i>Myung went to Eastern District.</i>

675
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:46,235
<i>The reason</i>
<i>he was taken to Eastern District</i>

676
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:49,989
was because of the very lawsuit
Myung told Ms. Kim to file.

677
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:52,909
So there is something.

678
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,245
Judging by the circumstances,

679
00:51:57,455 --> 00:51:59,957
Joon-gyeong's theory may possibly be right

680
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,376
that CEO Oh's death wasn't suicide?

681
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,755
It's circumstantial at best.
We still don't have actual proof.

682
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:08,007
Eastern District's CCTV footage was clean.

683
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,843
Ms. Kim's testimony isn't enough
to prove this.

684
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,971
Well, of course the CCTVs came out clean.

685
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:18,351
Except,
we've yet to look into cameras that move.

686
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:20,895
Dashcams.

687
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:22,605
Yes.

688
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:27,151
Public service vehicles are parked
at the office parking lot all night.

689
00:52:27,985 --> 00:52:30,905
We'll probably find something
in their dashcams, right?

690
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:32,782
What if the footage isn't there?

691
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,618
Mr. Nam's already begun looking.

692
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:48,464
SENIOR CHIEF HWANG GI-SEOK

693
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:49,882
This office

694
00:52:51,008 --> 00:52:53,052
was supposed to be for you,
after I moved up.

695
00:52:54,178 --> 00:52:55,221
Right?

696
00:52:57,139 --> 00:52:58,516
Yeong-jin.

697
00:53:00,768 --> 00:53:03,104
Loosen up. It's fine.

698
00:53:03,688 --> 00:53:04,939
Shit happens.

699
00:53:05,898 --> 00:53:08,359
I'm rather relieved
to have you by my side.

700
00:53:13,781 --> 00:53:14,949
However,

701
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:19,161
you'll have to take
a few potential charges from me.

702
00:53:22,456 --> 00:53:24,333
You're asking me?

703
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,173
You want to end at rock bottom?

704
00:53:32,884 --> 00:53:35,469
Just rest up in there for a few years.

705
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:39,682
I'll get you an even higher building
than CEO Oh's.

706
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:52,445
Chief Lee was indeed
at Eastern District that night.

707
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:53,863
But that's all we have.

708
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,617
I checked every car
that was parked that night.

709
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,410
But Myung's not in any of them.

710
00:54:01,495 --> 00:54:04,999
If Chief Lee was there,
we have stronger circumstantial evidence.

711
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:06,584
But no proof.

712
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,505
Chief Lee being there
doesn't prove anything.

713
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:19,263
We're back at square one.

714
00:54:23,768 --> 00:54:25,102
Let's just call it a day.

715
00:54:25,937 --> 00:54:26,979
No.

716
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,523
There's got to be something.

717
00:54:29,607 --> 00:54:32,068
What? We don't have any real proof.

718
00:54:33,152 --> 00:54:34,654
If there's no proof,

719
00:54:36,322 --> 00:54:37,823
we'll create it.

720
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,051
How do you feel?

721
00:54:58,511 --> 00:55:00,596
We should be giving you something better.

722
00:55:01,263 --> 00:55:03,516
I'm not sure if <i>gukbap</i>
is good enough for you.

723
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:08,437
You think this is funny?

724
00:55:14,694 --> 00:55:16,362
Just because you have me locked up,

725
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:18,948
you think I'll give you a single penny?

726
00:55:19,031 --> 00:55:21,367
No way, Gi-seok.

727
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,245
You will never defeat me.

728
00:55:24,328 --> 00:55:25,705
You don't have to give me anything.

729
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:29,291
I found all
of your borrowed-name accounts.

730
00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:33,754
Take a look. See if anything's missing.

731
00:55:40,678 --> 00:55:41,971
How…

732
00:55:44,765 --> 00:55:45,766
LIST OF PROPERTY

733
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:48,310
How did you find this?

734
00:55:48,394 --> 00:55:51,689
Eun Yong. You're aware of his skill.

735
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:55,776
Eun Yong, that motherfucker--

736
00:55:57,111 --> 00:55:58,154
Be careful.

737
00:55:58,654 --> 00:56:00,406
Watch your blood pressure.

738
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:04,368
You have to live long enough
to pay for your sins.

739
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,626
Money is power.

740
00:56:14,128 --> 00:56:15,629
I love that saying.

741
00:56:17,715 --> 00:56:19,175
Keep an eye out.

742
00:56:20,593 --> 00:56:22,553
Watch who becomes the real king.

743
00:56:27,933 --> 00:56:29,518
Law and money.

744
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:32,897
Everything's on my side now.

745
00:56:39,695 --> 00:56:41,864
Why did you go to
the Eastern District that night?

746
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,200
When was that?

747
00:56:45,951 --> 00:56:48,329
The night CEO Oh committed suicide.

748
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,331
I know you remember.

749
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:55,961
Yang Dong-cheol of Eastern District,
you attended the institute with him?

750
00:56:56,837 --> 00:56:58,339
Didn't you call me

751
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:01,926
as a witness
to Chairman Myung's fraud case?

752
00:57:03,427 --> 00:57:04,595
Well,

753
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:07,264
for now, you're just a witness.

754
00:57:07,848 --> 00:57:10,434
But you could become a suspect
if another charge is filed.

755
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:12,686
Another charge?

756
00:57:13,938 --> 00:57:17,399
First, write down why you went there
that day, and what you did there.

757
00:57:18,526 --> 00:57:20,277
Write down everything you remember.

758
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:24,949
I guess you obtained some other footage?

759
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:32,081
I couldn't possibly confront you,
if this is all I had on you, Chief.

760
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:36,627
So just write down the facts.

761
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:40,965
It's up to you

762
00:57:42,508 --> 00:57:44,343
whether you'll be an accomplice
or a suspect.

Yes, Joon-gyeong.

00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:34,203
-Yes, sir.
-You may begin.

787
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:46,840
<i>As I had predicted,</i>
<i>Hwang chose his own ambition.</i>

788
00:59:46,924 --> 00:59:49,593
Like you said, this is what I'm good at.

789
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:52,805
I'll shake you down
and pin you to anything we find.

790
00:59:55,724 --> 00:59:57,559
As to what CEO Yoon Hye-rin felt

791
00:59:58,477 --> 01:00:00,437
when she took her life.

792
01:00:02,731 --> 01:00:03,899
You get to find out.

793
01:00:04,483 --> 01:00:05,734
What, you asshole?

794
01:00:07,027 --> 01:00:08,654
What do you think you're doing?

795
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:13,200
-Stop it.
-Who'd you think you are?

796
01:00:13,284 --> 01:00:14,576
You get it now?

797
01:00:15,577 --> 01:00:17,037
You get who's above you,

798
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,206
and where your place is?

799
01:00:23,711 --> 01:00:25,629
You think getting Myung's money

800
01:00:27,506 --> 01:00:29,133
will have the world at your feet?

801
01:00:37,516 --> 01:00:39,393
<i>Myung took the rat poison,</i>

802
01:00:39,476 --> 01:00:43,022
<i>but what devoured Myung</i>
<i>was Gi-seok's greed.</i>

803
01:00:46,608 --> 01:00:48,027
<i>Now it's time for Hwang</i>

804
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:51,030
<i>to pay the price.</i>

805
01:01:27,816 --> 01:01:31,612
As of now, build a case linking Eun Yong,
and his fund to all his connections.

806
01:01:31,695 --> 01:01:33,238
<i>Shake them all down.</i>

807
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:37,034
If you find fault, blow it up.
If you find nothing, improvise.

808
01:01:37,117 --> 01:01:38,285
<i>Sounds just like Hwang.</i>

809
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:39,828
<i>He goes straight for the heart.</i>

810
01:01:39,912 --> 01:01:42,081
Not the heart, but my uncle's back.

811
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:44,625
<i>It's time to really put an end to this.</i>

812
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:46,835
<i>Let's do an operation,</i>
<i>while you're in here.</i>

813
01:01:47,461 --> 01:01:48,712
<i>Prosecutor Jang.</i>

814
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:50,672
Can you do this?

815
01:01:50,756 --> 01:01:54,134
<i>You know how Oh Chang-hyeon</i>
<i>and Kim Seong-tae died, don't you?</i>

816
01:01:54,718 --> 01:01:56,804
<i>As to what kind of person Hwang is,</i>

817
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,515
you know better than anyone.

818
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:02,768
Am I wrong?

819
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:06,805
