PARK HOON
KIM HONG-PA

00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,004
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, CASES,

6
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,004
AND THE SETTINGS OF THE PROSECUTION
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

7
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,188
Hey, Jang Tae-chun.

8
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,982
How dare you bring this to light
without reporting it to me?

9
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:09,528
Actually, Mr. Hwang
suddenly called for me, and--

10
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:12,656
You little bastard. Hey!

11
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,908
Great work.

12
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,536
Thanks to you,
our department's reputation has improved.

13
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,040
That bastard, Hwang Gi-seok,
is great at sly things like this.

14
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,793
Man, that sneaky son of a bitch.

15
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,004
Will you be questioning Kim Seong-tae
this morning?

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,924
At least he turned himself in.
So don't be too harsh on him.

17
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,468
I won't summon him.

18
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,721
I have everything I need anyway.
Plus I've got a pile of other cases.

19
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,809
I bet Gi-seok is going to treat you
to a feast.

20
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,352
Keep up the good work.

21
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:43,437
Goodbye, sir.

22
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:44,563
Oh, Mr. Nam.

23
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,732
-Good morning.
-Yes, good morning.

24
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,239
Have you decided to accept
Mr. Hwang's drink?

25
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,547
Mr. Nam.

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,215
Yes?

27
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,217
If a rookie like me captures
Chairman Myeong,

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,302
the loan shark king,
it'd be unbelievable, right?

29
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,350
Only if you get him.

30
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,021
-If you fail, you'll die.
-I'm aware.

31
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,443
I'm too young to die, you know.

32
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,246
I'm going to step out for a bit.
Meeting at 9:00 about Chairman Myeong.

33
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,925
<i>Work with me.</i>

34
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:01,557
I'll make you the most powerful prosecutor
in the country.

35
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,312
Come on.

36
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,696
Careful.

37
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,458
Wow!

38
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,879
Only when you're standing up this high
can you see far ahead

39
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,673
and broaden your horizons.

40
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,467
Got it?

41
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,888
So,

42
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,268
what's your plan with Major Park?

43
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,023
The law serves no purpose for them.

44
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,194
Doing time in prison
will only affect their health.

45
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,573
If they still have everything
even after they get released,

46
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,451
this cycle will just repeat itself.

47
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,999
We need to take away what Chairman Myeong
cherishes more than his life: money.

48
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,670
As for Hwang Gi-seok,
we'll take away his power.

49
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,842
Connecting them to CEO Oh
won't be enough to make that happen.

50
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,555
I'm a businessman.

51
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,059
My weapon is money, not the law.

52
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,520
Money?

53
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,604
Money.

54
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,858
I'm going to buy the entire
prosecution service of South Korea.

55
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:35,943
You hear me?

56
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,536
This feels great!

57
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,609
ATTACHED FILE
JANG TAE-CHUN

58
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,865
SEND

59
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,461
<i>Hey, Jang Tae-chun!</i>

60
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,213
-<i>I just sent it.</i>
-Okay.

61
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,383
All right. Great.

62
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,054
Let's see.

63
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,226
You know leaking confidential information
is illegal, right?

64
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,813
Of course.
All investments come with a risk.

65
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,150
<i>I'm risking my life here, not my money.</i>

66
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,904
I don't need deposit guarantees.
Just make sure you get results.

67
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,281
Hey, Tae-chun--

68
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,368
He sure does take after me.

69
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,331
All right.

70
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,063
Hello, Mr. Oh. Nice to meet you.

71
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,856
Yes, nice to meet you too.

72
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,193
The view here is amazing.

73
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,988
I thought it'd be best to talk
in a relaxed environment.

74
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,825
Of course. I've had it rough lately,
so this is great.

75
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,118
Please take a seat.

76
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,331
My name is Eun Yong.
I'm in the moneylending business.

77
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,415
Ah, yes.

78
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,004
I was trained under
Chairman Myeong In-ju in the past.

79
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,841
Yes, I've heard a lot about you.

80
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:08,011
You're the only one that extorted money
from Chairman Myeong in Myeong-dong.

81
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,807
Yeah, we go way back.

82
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:17,437
I'm sure you know about my relationship
with Chairman Myeong, so why call me here?

83
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:24,153
I want to invest in your company
instead of Chairman Myeong.

84
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,907
If I want to do business in Korea, isn't
it critical to have connections like you?

85
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,287
Gosh, I'm flattered by your words.

86
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,582
But loyalty is of great value to me.

87
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,625
You've had two elections
since you retired.

88
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,170
But Chairman Myeong
couldn't make you a congressman.

89
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,882
I think you have a better chance with me.

90
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,801
He's over the hill now.
So cut your ties with that old fox

91
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,679
and accept my offer.

92
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,975
There are tons of rich people out there.

93
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,770
But you know who Chairman Myeong's
son-in-law is, right?

94
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,733
You mean Chief Hwang Gi-seok?
The so-called Chef Hwang?

95
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,026
Yes, you're right.

96
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:08,614
I know I trained him,
but he's going to make it big.

97
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,127
Take a look at this.

98
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,374
STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

99
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,172
This is a document you signed saying
you earned cash from stock manipulation.

100
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,966
I got it from Dongdaemun.

101
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:34,014
So? Are you trying to
blackmail me with this?

102
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,643
What do you mean by blackmail?
I'm proposing an investment.

103
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,354
How dare you try to fool me?

104
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,983
Hey, you loan shark.

105
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:49,029
You think you are on par with me
because you have some money?

106
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:54,284
You should've brought gifts
if you wanted to build connections.

107
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,328
How dare you shove this in my face?

108
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,921
I wonder what will happen
if this goes into Chef Hwang's hands.

109
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,632
What if this cripples his success?

110
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,426
With what he can cook up,

111
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,180
I'm sure he'll boil you in hot water.

112
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,563
For your sake, I'm safely keeping
evidence from the prosecution.

113
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,733
We'll just call it collateral
for our trust.

114
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:31,446
And I think you misunderstood me.
I asked you to meet me today

115
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,199
not because I wanted to beg
for your connections

116
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,244
but because I want to buy them.

117
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,830
Buy my connections?

118
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,915
What will you do with them?

119
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,335
With investment comes restructuring.

120
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,212
I'm sure you're feeling uneasy

121
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,799
because the dog you trained
has grown too big.

122
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,971
They won't budge that easily.

123
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,018
Chairman Myeong and his son-in-law
committed a crime together.

124
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,939
Current GMI Bank, former Bluenet.

125
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,275
Do you remember CEO Yoon?

126
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,695
There's nothing you can do
with a past incident.

127
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:16,491
That case has been closed
with CEO Yoon's death.

128
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:20,078
The accomplice is still here
to reveal the truth.

129
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,372
An accomplice?

130
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,292
Come in.

131
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm Park Joon-gyeong.

132
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,734
CERTIFICATE OF ENTRY & EXIT

133
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,821
I've contacted the immigration office
at the airport,

134
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,950
and it turns out that he recently flew in
on a private plane from Mongolia.

135
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,745
He has a private plane?

136
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,293
My father-in-law was right.

137
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,177
-Who's the girl next to him?
-Her real name is Hong Han-na.

138
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,472
In the capital market, she's known
as Butterfly Hong or Teacher Hong.

139
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,475
-A butterfly?
-No, not a butterfly in the wild.

140
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,644
She's the "social butterfly" Hong.

141
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:30,065
<i>She has global and domestic connections</i>
<i>to the financial and political world.</i>

142
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,151
<i>She's also the co-owner of the hedge fund</i>
<i>Eun Yong runs.</i>

143
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,945
<i>She manages the investors.</i>

144
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,407
But there's never any return without risk.

145
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,701
Why would a global hedge fund owner
come to Korea?

146
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,162
If you want, we can call her in and ask.

147
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,124
I'm sure we can find something
in her foreign exchange records.

148
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,627
No, no. It would look suspicious
if we make the first move.

149
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,221
Put me through to Director Choi
from Financial Supervisory Service.

150
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:06,476
Minimizing risk. Wouldn't you agree
this is the role of a hedge fund?

151
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,982
<i>Are you sure? I hear that the investment</i>
<i>is to Korea and not Mongolian real estate.</i>

152
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,985
Where did he hear that news?

153
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,534
Don't you think that profits matter?

154
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,619
I'll be back here on the payment dates

155
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,165
with a large amount of money
to make you happy.

156
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,749
Inshallah.

157
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,713
These good-for-nothing rich wimps.

158
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,674
They keep whining like little kids.

159
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,553
You have the campaign funds
for CEO Oh all prepared, right?

160
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,640
I've been making excuses in six different
languages because of that.

161
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,018
Oh, a very good job.

162
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,606
-How did it go with CEO Oh?
-Yeah.

163
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,816
How is he as a person?

164
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,238
Decent. He's quite ambitious.
But he's also a coward.

165
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,785
-You saw the files I sent you, right?
-No. What is it?

166
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,039
Information from the prosecution
acquired by seize-and-search.

167
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,715
What the-- Damn it!

168
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,467
Goddamn it!

169
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,680
Are you unaware of the consequences
if I get caught with these files on my PC?

170
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,724
Trying to put us out of business?

171
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,936
We're giving money to CEO Oh
so he can stop that from happening.

172
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,563
Isn't this how you do business in Korea?

173
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,859
Take a look.
The information on there is all money.

174
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,864
You found something that's worth something
in here while all this was happening?

175
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,867
Isn't money the only thing that moves
those like you, me, Chairman Myeong,

176
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,119
and everyone else in the capital market?

177
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,334
Come on. Just take a look. Please?

178
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,153
Will CEO Oh take care of
the core members of the prosecution?

179
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,697
Yes.

180
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,742
Is your friend Eun Yong
a person you can trust?

181
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,371
He's family.

182
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:36,042
We will finalize everything
with the party leader this evening.

183
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,546
If the investigation starts
after you turn yourself in,

184
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,424
the party will initiate their attack too.

185
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,262
-Okay.
-There's no turning back after that.

186
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,391
There's no limit as to what kind
of dirty tricks they'll play on you.

187
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,728
My military uniform
probably can't protect me this time.

188
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,896
Even If they find a tiny flaw,

189
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,317
Hwang Gi-seok will stab me to death
with the power he wields.

190
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,027
If you are willing to stop here--

191
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,404
Revealing the truth,
punishing the culprit.

192
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,449
My mom always told me

193
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,203
those two things never happened,
although she protested with all her might.

194
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,792
I'm going to do it right this time.

195
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,056
If your mom were here,
she'd never forgive me.

196
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:33,975
No.

197
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,061
I'm sure…

198
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,189
Mom would've supported us.

199
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,075
MYUNG SE-HU
HWANG GI-SEOK'S WIFE

200
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:53,453
The chairman of the board wants to see you
after the reception.

201
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,833
It's about the rebate case in the Seoul
western prosecutors' office.

202
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,669
The accused won't be in custody.

203
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:01,920
Good job.

204
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,464
Your father told you, right?

205
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,300
He's going to delist GMI Bank

206
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,761
and transfer your shares
to Myeongin Holdings.

207
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,138
Yes, I heard. Attorney Lee dropped by.

208
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:16,267
I'll transfer more shares
under our kids' names this time.

209
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,188
It's better to come into an inheritance
when they are younger.

210
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:22,941
Sounds good.

211
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,820
When should I arrange a meal

212
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,906
with the young prosecutor
you took the picture with?

213
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,409
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun?

214
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,828
He's out.

215
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,623
Have you heard of someone named Eun Yong?

216
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,418
He used to work for your father.

217
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,503
Manager Eun?

218
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,298
Prosecutor Jang is his nephew.

219
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,927
Those two were going behind my back.

220
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,513
He was up to no good, so I cut him off.

221
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,393
Manager Eun came back to Korea?

222
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,564
Are you close with him?

223
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:09,028
He's toxic in many ways.

224
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,949
You won't see him again.

225
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,124
You should trim your sides.

226
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,585
Should I?

227
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,921
You shouldn't wear a tie for your next
briefing on Assemblyman Baek.

228
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,802
Everyone keeps an eye on the color
of the tie right before an election.

229
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,231
How was your meeting with Minister Son?

230
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,566
What's all this?

231
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,746
It's nice and neat, right?
I did some cleaning.

232
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,710
You're not alone anymore.

233
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,047
Let's eat.

234
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,347
Wow. Looks good.

235
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,350
This is called khorkhog.

236
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,271
It's Mongolian cuisine,
and it goes so well with kimchi.

237
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,608
Here. Try some.

238
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,700
Back in Mongolia,

239
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,369
you'd cook this with a wild rat,

240
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,830
but finding a wild rat in Korea
wasn't easy.

241
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,082
I had to jump through hoops to get this.

242
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,879
So I made this with beef.

243
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,673
The meat is Hanwoo from Hoengseong.

244
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,843
No need to worry. Just dig in.

245
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,891
Gosh, this is delicious.

246
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,898
-It's a bit salty.
-It's supposed to be salty.

247
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,610
Your mom taught me how to cook.

248
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,279
Want to drink some soju?

249
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,663
It's been a while.

250
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,001
Gosh, this is good.

251
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,548
Why didn't my mom leave me any messages
before her death?

252
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,635
She left one for Minister Son.

253
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,640
She must not have wanted to
burden you any longer.

254
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,728
I understand her,
but it makes me bitter at times.

255
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,148
Ms. Yoon always felt sorry for you.

256
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,651
-My mom?
-Yeah.

257
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,611
That's not true.

258
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,281
She always said I was dull and reserved.
That made her disappointed.

259
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,034
That's why she adored you.

260
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:46,412
You made her laugh
and got the house all rowdy.

261
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,334
They say family and close friends
don't know each other well.

262
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,628
You and your mom are just like that.

263
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,930
But still, it's your birthday.

264
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,933
I said I'd buy you something good.
You even said no to seaweed soup.

265
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,559
-You always want this soup.
-I mean it.

266
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,854
Your soup is the best of the best.
This soup is magical.

267
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,816
It's salty, but so delicious.

268
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,567
It's the best!

269
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,863
Thank you for the food.

270
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,537
Gosh. Salty and delicious.

271
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,957
It'd be great if Joon-gyeong
eats well like you do.

272
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,210
Tell me about it. I'm much better
than your daughter, aren't I?

273
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,797
Definitely not.
No matter what, my daughter is the best.

274
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,639
I'm always sorry and thankful.

275
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:52,145
Her dad passed away when she was young,
so she matured very early on.

276
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,188
I hoped she'd stay as my baby girl.

277
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,316
Oh…

278
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,445
I'm sorry to talk about this
when you're alone.

279
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,032
Not at all. You made me realize something.

280
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,619
I realized my parents would've felt
the same way as you.

281
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,748
Thank you!

282
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:17,086
I think Ms. Yoon hoped that
you'd live a relaxed and happy life

283
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,256
without trying too hard.

284
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,511
What are your plans after this job?

285
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,431
-My plans?
-Yeah.

286
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,266
Nothing on your mind, right?

287
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,561
Gosh, you're still such a big nerd.

288
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,354
For starters,

289
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,274
you should travel around
and have some fun.

290
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,902
I've been to many countries,
so I know the best places.

291
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,445
Have you been to Mongolia?

292
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,574
Words can't describe the stars
in the night sky in Mongolia.

293
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:50,411
It's incredible. It literally looks like
the stars are falling from the sky.

294
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,206
No, wait a minute.

295
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,249
Iceland is great too.

296
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,586
The northern lights there are amazing.

297
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,589
It's unbelievable.
Actually, you should go to Switzerland.

298
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,884
Eating instant noodles while enjoying

299
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,929
the snowy landscape of the Alps
is also fantastic.

300
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,348
Anyway, I'll let you use my private plane,

301
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,225
so you can go wherever.

302
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,853
-Will you be okay?
-Of course.

303
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,731
I prefer horseback riding
over flying my plane.

304
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,442
This fight--

305
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,696
You might end up losing
everything you have.

306
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:32,120
That's a good thing. Because now…

307
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,706
I have something to fight for.

308
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,926
I understand that you feel wronged.

309
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,971
But that case was closed four years ago.

310
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,432
The election is around the corner.

311
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,186
I can't just sit back
and watch those beasts run wild

312
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,729
in the election again.

313
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,025
You're right.
We can't let them get to us again.

314
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,486
But, Minister Son,

315
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:10,533
Hwang Gi-seok from Special Investigations
is practically on our side this election.

316
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,870
Thanks to their harsh investigation
of Assemblyman Baek,

317
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,706
the ruling party's ratings took a dive.

318
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,544
All they are doing is hunting down
a powerless old man who once had power.

319
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,800
In the end, they'll hunt us down again.

320
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,429
All right, then.

321
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,058
Is the accomplice certain
about her decision?

322
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,896
If she changes her mind,
we'll have to face a backlash.

323
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,191
I assure you that will never happen.

324
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:47,069
I'll put everything on the line
and take full responsibility.

325
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,154
All right.

326
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,460
Ms. Kim! Look what you've done!

327
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,755
How could you stab me in the back?

328
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,135
Mr. Myeong, I must've lost my mind.

329
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:14,013
I'm such a crazy bitch. You crazy bitch!

330
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:18,935
I'm sorry. Please let it slide this once.
I'll never do it again.

331
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,728
What's the point, after all this time?

332
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,733
Should I sew your lips?

333
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,070
Or…

334
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,875
-should I burn them?
-Please save me!

335
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,295
I beg you, spare me!

336
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,673
People must think
I'm a gang leader or something.

337
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:53,636
We've been friends for a long time,
so we can solve this with money.

338
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,720
But,

339
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,392
to remind you of your wrongdoings
and as a sign of self-reflection…

340
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,480
let's get you a nice tattoo!

341
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,152
Didn't you say you became friends
with Eun Yong in juvie?

342
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,780
You didn't know he was in Korea?

343
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,741
When I went to prison,

344
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:18,786
we lost touch, so I haven't heard
from him for a long time.

345
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,121
Is that so?

346
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,205
Yes, sir.

347
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,383
Transfer Ms. Kim's assets under your name.

348
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,843
My name?

349
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,805
Seong-tae isn't here anymore,
so someone has to do his work.

350
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,603
I'll serve you well, sir.

351
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,189
JUDGE ADVOCATE
PARK JOON-GYEONG

352
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,654
-Have you arrived?
-Thanks. I'm here.

353
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,324
I'll call after I finish my deal
with CEO Oh.

354
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,118
Yeah. Bye.

355
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,800
APPLICANT PARK JOON-GYEONG

356
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:52,690
Did you call for me, sir?

357
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,609
I heard from Chief Park
you're wrapping up the Kim Seong-tae case.

358
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,947
Yes. I finished it up nicely,
just like you ordered, sir.

359
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:01,574
Really?

360
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,742
It doesn't look that way.

361
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:05,786
Sorry?

362
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,746
The name is Eun Yong.

363
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,166
He's your uncle, right?

364
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,594
What are you doing?

365
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,354
<i>Financial Supervisory Service is here.</i>

366
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,569
<i>I checked, and he flew</i>
<i>into the country a few days ago.</i>

367
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,822
And as soon as he arrived,
he's been on the move to buy shares.

368
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,408
But coincidentally, he's buying

369
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,330
GMI Bank shares,
the case in which his nephew is in charge.

370
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,581
GMI SHARES REPORT

371
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,210
-I had no idea--
-Did you, as a prosecutor,

372
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,086
use confidential information

373
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,672
to conspire with a concert party
for your own gain?

374
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,844
Put that down! What are you doing?

375
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:06,889
-I'll sue you for obstruction of business!
-Go ahead!

376
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,892
We'll sue you for obstruction of justice!
Out of our way!

377
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,201
I think I can take on three,
don't you think?

378
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,037
Did Chairman Myeong send you?

379
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,050
We're from Financial Supervisory Service.
Step away from the computer.

380
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,396
Oh, my!

381
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,773
Hi!

382
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,025
Abuse of power, bribery,

383
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:02,361
insider trading
using confidential information.

384
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:06,615
If I take this case, you'll become
a corrupt prosecutor in less than a week.

385
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,910
You'll be standing before the press
in cuffs.

386
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,420
Why did you do this?

387
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,444
I was planning on training you properly
because you seemed useful.

388
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,779
Why?

389
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:52,995
Why would you rack your dumb brain
and ruin your life?

390
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,917
Hey.

391
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,920
You're done now.

392
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,684
It's been a while.

393
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,312
How have you been?

394
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:32,868
I knew you'd take care of a few guys.

395
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,580
I'm sorry I couldn't come visit

396
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,750
when your grandmother passed.

397
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,966
Hey, Jin-ho.

398
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,094
Work with me now.

399
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,055
Working for Chairman Myeong--

400
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,451
Prosecutor Jang.

401
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,329
He asked for you to return
your entry card.

402
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,807
UNCLE EUN YONG

403
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,856
<i>Your call cannot be completed as dialed.</i>
<i>At the tone, please record your…</i>

404
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,450
<i>We have a problem.</i>
<i>Call me as soon as possible.</i>

405
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,268
-What's going on?
-The inspection team is here for a check.

406
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,994
Did something happen
between you and Mr. Hwang?

407
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,634
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

408
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,595
-Take the bag to the chairman.
-Right away, sir.

409
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,482
You may speak.

410
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,443
-<i>I've sent over the contract first.</i>
-What about him?

411
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,207
<i>It's a shame I didn't get to say</i>
<i>a proper goodbye.</i>

412
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,003
Wrap it up nicely, got it?

413
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,217
Yes, sir.

414
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:50,440
My kid studied hard on his own

415
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:53,151
and got into a good company
after taking an exam.

416
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,737
There's nothing I can do about that.

417
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,866
Is an assemblyman's son forbidden
from getting a job?

418
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,659
-Gosh, these people…
-Goodness.

419
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:07,291
Weren't you going to train Jang Tae-chun?
That's what I thought because of the news.

420
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,334
He's got the guts.

421
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:11,837
But he's tactless.

422
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,590
After all, he's from a lousy university.

423
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,427
I'll reassign the case on Kim Seong-tae
to Prosecutor Choi.

424
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,891
Your actions against me right now

425
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:27,519
are an attack against Korean democracy!

426
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:32,608
Sir, we don't have any cameras here.
You don't need to exaggerate anymore.

427
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,323
Make sure you write that on the report.

428
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,407
Yes, sir.

429
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:45,495
Hey, Lee Yeong-jin.
You used to be in Supreme Office, huh?

430
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:46,580
Yes, sir.

431
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,083
The deputy chief prosecutor there
was Cho Jang-hun, right?

432
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,293
The half-bald guy.

433
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,504
He got a hair transplant,
but, yes, he was deputy chief prosecutor.

434
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,715
Did you know?

435
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,717
He used to work right under me.

436
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,762
He told me a lot about you.
That you are smart.

437
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,516
Hey, but don't you have anything to drink?

438
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,604
Oh, well…

439
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,481
What would you like to drink?

440
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,613
Hey, Gi-seok! Are you there?

441
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,782
I'm thirsty.

442
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,701
Bring me a bottle of beer, will you?

443
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,831
Investigator, go grab us some beer.

444
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:30,916
Yes, sir.

445
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,379
Sir, we're getting beer right now.

446
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,673
Prosecutor Lee,
let's take a 20-minute break.

447
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,469
Okay! Thank you, thank you!

448
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,516
Gosh, Mr. Baek is so obnoxious.

449
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,268
How far are you going to take this?

450
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,858
-You went to the same high school as him?
-Yeah.

451
00:37:56,942 --> 00:38:00,362
-I mean, he's way older than me, but--
-He's a goner now.

452
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:04,700
It's about his son's unfair recruitment.
He has no hope for the next term.

453
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,369
It seems like his party abandoned him too.

454
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,453
Yeah.

455
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:14,167
Still, we don't want the opposing party
to spread their wings before the election.

456
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:17,713
After all, he's a senior prosecutor,
so we should protect his digni--

457
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,548
If you made a deal with him, let me know.

458
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,427
-Don't whine about it after it blows up.
-What did you say?

459
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,346
You're out of line here.

460
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:30,517
Out of line?

461
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,603
I guess I was.

462
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,153
So what?

463
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,074
Hey, Jeong-su.

464
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,785
Stop meddling in business…

465
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,749
you can't even handle, all right?

466
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,669
Just prepare well for your transfer
to the district office.

467
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,880
Don't you want your promotion?

468
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,179
Yes, sir.

469
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,014
Yes.

470
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:14,019
<i>I've taken care of Minister Son.</i>

471
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:19,149
I'll look forward to your investigation
based on law and order

472
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,692
in the future as well.

473
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,237
Of course, sir.

474
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:27,657
I promise to bring results
you'll be satisfied with.

475
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:36,249
-The press conference got canceled.
-What? All of a sudden?

476
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,752
<i>Thanks to the investigation,</i>
<i>our party rating is on the rise.</i>

477
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,129
The party thinks holding back
Special Investigations

478
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,631
won't help with the election.

479
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,092
Isn't the prosecution influencing
a past election

480
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,885
much bigger news than that?

481
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,512
<i>That's still only a possibility.</i>

482
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,556
But Assemblyman Baek's investigation
ensures our votes.

483
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,100
Nothing has changed.

484
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,228
I will turn myself in to the prosecution
and testify, as we planned.

485
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,816
The prosecution won't cooperate either.

486
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:05,362
I think CEO Oh met with our party leader
and persuaded him last night.

487
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:08,949
CEO Oh?

488
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,350
Are you feeling better now?

489
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,437
I'm dying here.
I've had one too many drinks.

490
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,484
You heard that the opposing party
has been taken care of, right?

491
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,194
Great work, sir.

492
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,824
So, did you get the contract
from Dongdaemun?

493
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,451
Of course. I'm close with everyone there.

494
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,544
Is this the right one?

495
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:07,174
Gosh, if you needed money,
you should've come to me.

496
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,178
What happened to the guy
who blackmailed me with this?

497
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,013
He didn't seem like a pushover.

498
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:18,977
Financial Supervisory Service raided
his fund, so there's nothing he could do.

499
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,106
He left the country
before they issued his travel ban.

500
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,499
Prepare the money before the election,
like you promised yesterday.

501
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,793
I always keep my word.

502
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,214
So, Mr. Oh,

503
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:50,258
stop leaving evidence behind
by moving independently.

504
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:53,220
Be sure to discuss everything with me
before you do anything.

505
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,682
-Gosh, that hurts!
-Hey, you prick.

506
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:00,769
Hey, Myeong In-ju.

507
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,773
Do you think I'm at a level

508
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:06,900
where I have to

509
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,152
discuss everything with you?

510
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:11,613
Not at all, sir.

511
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,367
It was a slip of the tongue, sir.

512
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:22,666
Make sure this doesn't happen ever again.
Behave like a real cartel leader.

513
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,043
-Got that?
-Yes, sir.

514
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,836
I'll serve you well, sir.

515
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,464
Since you are four years older now,

516
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,927
make sure you do everything properly
this election, all right?

517
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,054
Yes, sir.

518
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,621
Yong!

519
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,755
Why can't I reach--

520
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,091
You can't reach him either?

521
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:33,903
Where are we?

522
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,533
On the way to the airport.

523
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:42,871
What happened?

524
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:47,459
This is for the hospital bill
you paid for my grandma.

525
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:52,464
Thank you for taking care of her
while I was behind bars.

526
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,176
Your grandma is family.
No need to thank me.

527
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,554
This is as far as I can help you.

528
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,474
Don't ever come back to Korea.

529
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,894
If you do,
it's the end for the both of us.

530
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,694
Jin-ho.

531
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,365
Just come with me.

532
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:22,452
Stop this ridiculous work
and work with me.

533
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,787
You never change.

534
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,290
I know you made a fortune.
But your ways don't work here.

535
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,127
Do you know the kind of people
that visit Chairman Myeong's villa?

536
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,088
I'm doing this because I know.

537
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,678
Have you been doing drugs?

538
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:45,433
Don't you know what happened
to the guys that got hooked on drugs?

539
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,685
You're not the only one who changed.

540
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:50,063
Our lives…

541
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,274
were over the moment we got sent to juvie.

542
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,026
Still, doing drugs?

543
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,739
It's fine, as long as you control it.

544
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,533
It enhances your concentration too.

545
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,212
My car is nice, right?

546
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:17,507
Hey, I'm going to make it big now.

547
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:20,885
Thanks to you, I got my chance.

548
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,306
You wearing your seat belt?

549
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,142
Why? You scared?

550
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,561
The car is nice indeed.

551
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:34,983
Fuck!

552
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,337
Let go!

553
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,366
Damn.

554
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,086
Fuck.

555
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,674
Is this 911?

556
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:43,927
There's been a car accident here.

557
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,095
Please track my phone and come quickly.

558
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,640
Yes, thank you.

559
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,313
Gosh.

560
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,012
GENERAL SURGERY CLINIC

561
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:47,407
I think you can sell Orland Bio
at 14,000 won.

562
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,952
The guy who told me to buy it said
it'll go over 20,000 won a share.

563
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,621
Those who profit from stocks
spread rumors like that.

564
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,040
They'll sell and run.

565
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:01,546
Looking at the volume, I'd say
they are aiming for… about 14,000 won.

566
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,173
Really? That could've been a disaster.

567
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,556
-What? You two came together?
-What happened to you?

568
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,309
What do you mean, what happened?
I almost died.

569
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,060
You think this is funny?

570
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,062
Are you badly hurt?

571
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:21,941
Fortunately, the guy had a nice car.

572
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:23,735
He got lucky.

573
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,738
-But still, make sure to have a checkup.
-Okay.

574
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,240
-I'll prescribe you some pills for today.
-Okay.

575
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:31,576
Thank you. Here. Best of luck.

576
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:39,167
Why are you guys brooding?
I'm the one who got injured.

577
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,129
I'm fine.

578
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:49,010
The opposing party pulled out,
and Hwang Gi-seok started cornering us.

579
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,346
It's just like Chairman Myeong.

580
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:54,349
He found out our moves
and played his cards.

581
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,100
He even attempted to murder you.

582
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,854
-I'll get a warrant issued for murder.
-There's no need.

583
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,231
It's time to pay him back.

584
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:04,525
How will you get payback
when CEO Oh betrayed you?

585
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,405
I have just the right card
for this dirty dogfight.

586
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,074
Who?

587
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,241
The enemy's enemy.

588
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:16,412
It means we're on the same team.
Doesn't it?

589
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:36,140
Hello, sir.

590
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:42,522
Hey! I told you not to let anyone in here!

591
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,776
I have nothing to say to a reporter.

592
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,991
Seriously?
I said I have nothing to tell you!

593
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,745
I'm not a reporter.

594
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,590
What brings a vice president
of a hedge fund here?

595
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:13,469
Our company was raided by
Financial Supervisory Service today.

596
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:17,515
The one behind it seems to be
Hwang Gi-seok from Special Investigations.

597
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,268
Gosh, those dirty bastards.

598
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,357
Why don't you pour me one?

599
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:33,531
I'm sure you're not here to drink
out of sympathy.

600
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:39,203
I'm just a powerless assemblyman.

601
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:42,123
I'm sure you know I'm in no position
to grant you any favors,

602
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,375
as I can't pull strings anymore.

603
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:50,214
That powerless string of yours--
I'm here to offer you a fortune for it.

604
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:55,011
On top of that, you'll get your revenge.

605
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,432
I can't trust Assemblyman Baek.

606
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,516
Same here.

607
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,896
You two seem to be hitting it off.

608
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,149
He's a nastier snake than CEO Oh
and does politics for business.

609
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,943
I've dug into him for months
night and day.

610
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,445
He's a piece of garbage.

611
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,114
Why would you trust a person?

612
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:18,826
Business is about what each party wants.
It's about giving and taking.

613
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,244
By the way, you two…

614
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,915
really said you don't want any ramyeon?

615
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,585
I hate it when people ask for a bite
after saying they won't have any.

616
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,086
Enjoy your ramyeon.

617
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,713
Okay.

618
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:39,931
-Hey, Han-na.
-Are you sure you're okay?

619
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:43,226
The investors will throw a fit
when they find out about the car crash.

620
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,145
-You haven't been introduced yet, right?
-This is my partner, Hong--

621
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,522
-I'm Hong Han-na.
-Right.

622
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:48,856
Except for the number game,

623
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,984
I'm in charge of everything
at the hedge fund called Change.

624
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:53,820
Especially taking care of him.

625
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:56,364
I called your doctor, so drop by tomorrow

626
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,825
-and get a whole MRI body scan.
-Okay.

627
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,451
I'm Park Joon-gyeong.

628
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:04,914
Major, you look much prettier in real life
than in your photos.

629
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:09,126
-Hello. I'm a prosecutor from--
-Oh, you must be Jang Tae-chun.

630
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,380
If Yong is your uncle, am I your aunt?

631
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,173
Nice to meet you.

632
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:16,467
How did the meeting go
with Assemblyman Baek?

633
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:20,555
Hey!

634
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:26,936
Assemblyman Baek?
Gosh, that bastard is a heavy drinker.

635
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,230
Gosh, this is delicious.

636
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,439
Please!

637
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,859
Why are you screaming? Just a bite.

638
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,528
You never stop with just one bite.

639
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,449
-By the way--
-Why? What's wrong?

640
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,451
Will Chairman Myeong take the bait?

641
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:44,370
Of course, the smell of ramyeon--

642
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:48,666
The smell of money will lure him in.
He just can't help it.

643
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,877
What kind of bait?

644
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:54,922
You know the confidential information
you sent me last time?

645
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,300
I found something
that's worth money in there.

646
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:02,013
Can you move?

647
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,892
Seriously…

648
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,486
Oh, right! Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun!

649
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:22,450
I knew I'd heard that name somewhere.
I guess he's Manager Eun's nephew.

650
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,702
But that Manager Eun

651
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,537
came to Korea…

652
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,707
and left?

653
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,958
He left.

654
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:33,794
He left for good this time.

655
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,967
That's why I have a job for you.

656
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:41,719
What is it?

657
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,681
It's obviously about money.

658
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:50,853
When you were laundering money,
you left out some of GMI Bank's assets.

659
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:56,108
That can't be. I laundered and pocketed
everything that was worth money.

660
00:53:57,652 --> 00:54:00,029
You didn't take the patent
that CEO Yoon had

661
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,324
back when she owned Bluenet.

662
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,245
My goodness. That's a patent from
the '70s and '80s that no one uses now.

663
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,872
It's a useless antique.

664
00:54:09,956 --> 00:54:12,291
Gosh, you prick.

665
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,461
Of course it's a piece of junk to us.

666
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:18,297
But in developing countries like
South America and South East Asia,

667
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,590
it's worth money!

668
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:26,472
Make sure you register
CEO Yoon's patent for profit.

669
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:30,351
Then we'll find an overseas IT company
for backdoor listing!

670
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:34,230
Wow! The charts for this
will look beautiful.

671
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:36,732
This plan is grand and global.

672
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:38,943
This feels optimistic!

673
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,199
This is Manager Eun's idea, isn't it?

674
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,957
This is the manipulation plan

675
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,793
the Financial Supervisory Service
seized from his hedge fund.

676
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,920
Geez, that bastard.

677
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,507
He has a knack for finding
where gold is stashed.

678
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,344
But, sir,

679
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:09,140
ever since we delisted GMI Bank,
it's been on a special watch list,

680
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:11,809
so we can't get the patent rights.

681
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,437
What did you say?

682
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:18,774
Well, that's what usually happens.

683
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:23,863
You can even get confidential data
from the Financial Supervisory Service.

684
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,698
So anything is possible for you.

685
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:30,745
You punk.

686
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,250
It's been a while.

687
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,501
Please take a look.

688
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:40,212
What's this?

689
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,801
Oh, Prosecutor Jang. It's been a while.

690
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,181
You don't need to stand up. It's fine.

691
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:56,520
Enjoy your meal, sir.

692
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,355
Thanks.

693
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:02,568
You look like you have a lot on your mind.
Is something worrying you?

694
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,696
Gosh, Mr. Hwang. It's been a while.

695
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,282
Oh, Mr. Nam. I hope you are well.

696
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,242
Of course I'm well.

697
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:12,703
I'll come and visit you
after my retirement.

698
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:15,664
The door to my office is always open
for you, Mr. Nam.

699
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:17,249
Please do call me.

700
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:21,295
-I'll make sure you have a good time.
-Oh, my.

701
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,881
-It's a promise, then.
-All right.

702
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,674
-Enjoy your meal.
-You too.

703
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:26,926
Enjoy.

704
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,023
Why do you have to make it so obvious
that you hate him?

705
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,734
You deserve to win an Oscar, Mr. Nam.

706
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,278
I almost thought
you two were best friends.

707
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:51,325
I guess I deserve an Oscar then.
I especially hate him.

708
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:58,874
But… do you think
my uncle's plan will work?

709
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:02,086
If he's the only player who beat
Chairman Myeong at his own game,

710
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,712
I'd put my money on him.

711
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,013
Prosecutor Jang.

712
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,682
Yes?

713
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,642
The whale took the bait.

714
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,197
Hey, hey, hey.

715
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:34,410
Take a look. I've taken care of the dates
to last week and the patent transfer.

716
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:39,832
Thank you.

717
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,750
I got you a large-sized coffee.

718
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:49,925
Thank you for the coffee, sir.

719
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,439
Hello, Chairman.
I've transferred the patent rights.

720
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,483
All right. Good work. Come to my office.

721
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:07,735
Yes, sir.

722
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,993
-A car accident?
-Yes, sir.

723
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,745
Was Jin-ho high again?

724
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,873
I'm not sure of the details, sir.

725
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,459
He's breathing through a ventilator
at the moment.

726
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:26,545
Gosh, that little brat.

727
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,382
Something feels off here.

728
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:47,358
-I didn't expect to see you here, Mr. Lee.
-Oh, my. Look who this is. Mr. Nam.

729
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,402
What brings you here, Mr. Nam?

730
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:55,074
My goodness.

731
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,159
I'm here to arrest you, Mr. Lee.

732
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:09,046
I have Mr. Lee secured.

733
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,590
Okay. Time to go whale hunting.

734
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,301
Let's go.

735
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,563
Mom,

736
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:30,776
today is the last day I'm visiting you
in my military uniform.

737
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:34,280
Although I won't
have dignity as a soldier,

738
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:38,742
I'll make sure to retrieve
the dignity that you once lost.

739
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:43,789
I love you, Mom.

740
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,623
-What's going on?
-First of all,

741
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:30,294
please tell us why
you have requested a press conference.

742
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,340
I would like to confess a crime
that was committed

743
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:36,925
three years ago during an investigation.

744
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:40,512
As a former prosecutor,
I have to inform you that

745
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:42,514
you may have to face charges

746
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:46,310
such as defamation and libel
as consequence of this press conference.

747
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,396
There is no law that can punish me
for revealing the truth.

748
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:54,735
Then please, can you introduce yourself?

749
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:16,340
I am…

750
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:19,718
the daughter of CEO Yoon Hye-rin,
who faced an unfair death

751
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:22,179
as a result of insider trading
by those in power.

752
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:26,392
And I'm one of the culprits
in the bribery-and-manipulation case

753
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,310
that led to CEO Yoon's death.

754
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,439
Please cancel
all his afternoon appointments.

755
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,652
I ask this question to the accomplice
of the crime I committed,

756
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,738
Hwang Gi-seok of Special Investigations:

757
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,032
What is justice…

758
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,201
to you?

759
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:32,958
<i>What if you have to become a monster
to fight monsters?</i>

760
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,685
<i>You can refuse to testify,
appoint a lawyer,</i>

761
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,212
<i>or put pressure on us
through your son-in-law…</i>

762
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:39,381
-But let's go to the Prosecution first.
-What did you say?

763
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:41,842
<i>A total of six men of equal rank
to the chief prosecutor…</i>

764
01:02:42,021 --> 01:02:43,981
Getting an arrest warrant won't be easy.

765
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:46,054
<i>Because the situation has changed,</i>

766
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:47,723
I have a new offer.

767
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,099
I will…

768
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:50,976
<i>make you a National Assemblyman.</i>

769
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:52,895
<i>There's only one way…</i>

770
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:54,897
<i>Please stop everything you're doing.</i>

771
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,940
<i>I have a search and seizure warrant.</i>

772
01:02:57,846 --> 01:02:58,847
<i>Can you…</i>

773
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:00,655
<i>please contact Eun Yong?</i>

774
01:03:00,912 --> 01:03:04,826
