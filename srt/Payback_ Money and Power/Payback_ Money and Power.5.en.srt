ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,004
AND THE SETTINGS OF THE PROSECUTION
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

7
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,987
-I have Mr. Lee secured.
-<i>Okay.</i>

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,739
Time to start the whale hunt.

9
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,205
What is this?

10
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,372
<i>First,</i>

11
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:24,043
<i>tell us why you requested</i>
<i>the press conference.</i>

12
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:29,465
<i>I'd like to confess the crimes I committed</i>
<i>during my time</i>

13
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,674
<i>as the Prosecution.</i>

14
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,261
<i>As a former prosecutor myself,</i>

15
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,263
<i>this sort of press conference</i>

16
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:40,059
<i>is susceptible to</i>
<i>a defamation and libel lawsuit.</i>

17
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,020
<i>No law can punish one</i>
<i>for telling the truth.</i>

18
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,439
Then,

19
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:48,484
why don't you introduce yourself?

20
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:08,712
BAEK IN-SU PRESS CONFERENCE

21
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,548
I am

22
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,467
the daughter of CEO Yoon Hye-rin,
who died unjustly

23
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:16,136
due to corrupt power dealings.

24
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,806
I'm also a co-conspirator
in the bribery manipulation case

25
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,517
which caused her untimely death.

26
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,108
Cancel Chief's afternoon itinerary.

27
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,613
<i>I'd like to ask the person</i>
<i>who co-conspired with me,</i>

28
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:37,449
<i>Chief Hwang Gi-seok</i>
<i>of Special Investigations,</i>

29
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,286
<i>what is justice…</i>

30
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,620
FORMER PROSECUTOR CONFESSES

31
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:42,913
<i>…to you?</i>

32
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:53,841
We had no idea
Park Joon-gyeong would work with Baek.

33
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,801
This wasn't her idea.

34
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,428
Then whose?

35
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,607
<i>-Three years ago…</i>
-I'm watching it.

36
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,443
-Little bitch is fierce.
<i>-my mother was interrogated…</i>

37
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,236
You mentioned Jang's uncle.

38
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,156
He has relations with Park?

39
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,408
Manager Eun must have had known

40
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,994
the late CEO Yoon.

41
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,164
Are you sure this Eun Yong
is taken care of?

42
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:29,084
I personally saw to it in real time.

43
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,629
<i>Don't worry, Gi-seok.</i>

44
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,339
<i>It's for times like this</i>

45
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,926
that I bought drinks for CEO Oh
and the old geezers at Seocho-dong.

46
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,929
What the hell?

47
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,141
I'm Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.
Seoul Central District Office.

48
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,976
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun?

49
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:50,773
Attorney Lee has been arrested
for misappropriation and malpractice.

50
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,691
<i>You are also under arrest</i>

51
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,402
-for the same crimes.
-What?

52
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,528
<i>…documents of evidence.</i>

53
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,490
What the--
The hell do you think you're doing?

54
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,575
Don't you know who I am, you shits?

55
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,118
I'll strip you of your titles!

56
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:06,038
-<i>Let me go!</i>
-<i>You have the right not to testify.</i>

57
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,958
<i>You may choose your attorney,</i>
<i>or have your son-in-law threaten us.</i>

58
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,752
-But first, please come with us.
-What did you say?

59
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,547
Hey, let go now! I said, let go!

60
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:19,677
<i>Chief Hwang had me arrested</i>
<i>in order to conceal the truth…</i>

61
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,261
<i>I won't let this slide!</i>

62
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,478
He's here.

63
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:42,199
<i>Myungdong's loan shark,</i>
<i>charged with stealing from company assets,</i>

64
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,661
<i>has been revealed as</i>
<i>the father-in-law of Chief Hwang,</i>

65
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,330
<i>recently under fire</i>
<i>for prosecutorial misconduct.</i>

66
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,458
<i>Public interest is surging</i>
<i>amidst suspicions</i>

67
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,586
<i>against high-level prosecutors'</i>
<i>cover-up practices.</i>

68
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,471
Our deal is still on.

69
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,308
The contract you proposed as collateral.
It's gone, no?

70
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,102
It may be gone,

71
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,979
but as you can see, I'm fine.

72
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,525
Since the situation has changed,
here's a new proposition for you.

73
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,986
I hear the Prosecutor who arrested
Chairman Myung

74
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,487
is your nephew?

75
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,365
I doubt you'll conjure up anything

76
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,660
with a low-level prosecutor like him.

77
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,455
You're right.

78
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,582
In order to size up to Hwang,

79
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,418
he'll need your support.

80
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,086
Why would I do that?

81
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,798
I will make you

82
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,884
a National Assemblyman.

83
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,220
Offering a gift this time?

84
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,600
Listen, my friend.

85
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,311
They say,
you can't do politics without money,

86
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,314
but money isn't everything either.

87
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,566
This sounds too familiar.

88
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,487
Chairman Myung also promised me
a local constituency--

89
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,239
What about Assemblyman Baek's
Third District?

90
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,241
It's a stronghold for the ruling party.

91
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,786
Would that be possible?

92
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,624
Baek has little hope in the next election.

93
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,167
I would think

94
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,127
he understands that more than anyone.

95
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:25,219
Which means more people will strive
to take his seat.

96
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,680
But regarding money,

97
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:29,973
I top them all.

98
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,185
As you know,
I've grown pretty close with Baek.

99
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,441
INCOMING CALL
CHIEF HWANG GI-SEOK

100
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,407
If you don't take that call…

101
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,580
I'm going to assume
you're sealing the deal with me.

102
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,215
I promise I didn't know.

103
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,175
Hwang, you know how this goes.

104
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,846
Doing arrests without a warrant.
It's to feed the press before anything.

105
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,015
Jang did this unilaterally,
without his superior's approval?

106
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,601
I'm serious.
The bastard didn't report a word of this.

107
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,727
You dumbass.

108
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,898
You call yourself a chief,
and that's the best excuse you got?

109
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,359
Listen, I'm really sorry.

110
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,944
But Hwang, listen.

111
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,822
Arrests without warrants
only last 48 hours.

112
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,200
I'll take care of everything
during the suspect examination.

113
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,035
Chief Park.

114
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,665
Chief Park.

115
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,794
-Hey, Jeong-su.
-Hey, come on. Let go.

116
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,005
Fine.

117
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,716
Punch me if you want.

118
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,685
Let's do this right, okay?

119
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,314
Report to me in real time.

120
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,025
Of course, man.

121
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,406
Gi-seok.

122
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,290
My transfer to Busan.
It's still happening, right?

123
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:22,461
I already signed a lease
to an apartment in Haeundae.

124
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,094
PROSECUTION SERVICE

125
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,393
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OFFICE

126
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,178
Your father-in-law

127
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,930
is in our interrogation room.

128
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,267
I'll give you time to speak to him.

129
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,894
He's a suspect in your case.

130
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,147
Let's not create any misunderstandings.

131
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,317
Chief Hwang.

132
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,073
I'm going to find my own way

133
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,284
to the seventh floor.

134
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,292
Catch a Special Investigations prosecutor,

135
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,002
then enter Special Investigations.

136
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,190
PROSECUTOR JANG TAE-CHUN

137
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,247
Is Myung's attorney here?

138
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:29,254
Three more have submitted
the application for appointment.

139
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:32,049
Six men equal in rank
to the district chief.

140
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,342
Oh, man.

141
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,054
It'll be a challenge
to even get an arrest warrant.

142
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,724
We caused the commotion,

143
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:41,975
but can we pull through?

144
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,437
You said it yourself.

145
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,855
Fail to get him…

146
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,483
or die.

147
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,624
So, you're back on with CEO Oh?

148
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,465
TEMPORARY PRESS PASS

149
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,801
He gave me a press pass.

150
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,554
Now you can come and go,
without leaving records.

151
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,601
Wow, how much is this thing?

152
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,522
One little line in this logo
is probably worth a building.

153
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,691
The middle line symbolizes uprightness.

154
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,819
The others: fairness, truth, justice,

155
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,779
and human rights.

156
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,322
Wow.

157
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,908
Is that a question in the bar exam?

158
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,417
Having you become a prosecutor,

159
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,044
I hoped this country would change
for the better.

160
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,464
Do you ever regret quitting?

161
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,802
Nothing in the world is for free.

162
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,888
What about you?

163
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,559
You won't regret wasting your fortune
on revenge?

164
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,394
What do you mean "wasting"?

165
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:12,149
I'm investing money into knocking sense
into South Korea's Prosecution.

166
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,818
Listen, these lines mean:

167
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,279
Fairness, justice…

168
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,326
Can't be "quick delivery."
What'd you say it was?

169
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,456
Those qualities can't be bought.

170
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,881
You do what money can't buy,

171
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,383
by returning to the Prosecution.

172
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,219
You've left the military,
so return to Prosecution.

173
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,139
I'll cook something up
for resigned prosecutors

174
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,891
to get re-hired.

175
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,482
No big deal.

176
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,447
ARREST WARRANT

177
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,533
Myung and Attorney Lee aren't talking,
but the evidence is solid--

178
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:08,038
So, the patent office official claims
the money was borrowed and not a bribe?

179
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,250
Yes, but I'll find the forged document
and prove its quid pro quo nature…

180
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,631
I mean, I'll fix any inadequacies
and report back immediately.

181
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,218
I'm ready for any criticism.

182
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,720
I'll fix the papers a hundred times
if I have to.

183
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,185
-You're good.
-What?

184
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,896
It's approved.

185
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,525
Even the court won't be able to nullify
an arrest warrant like this.

186
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,443
You're approving this at first go?

187
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,695
Once is enough, no?

188
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,989
I'll allocate all other cases

189
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,866
to Prosecutor Choi.

190
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,576
You concentrate on this case for now.

191
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,498
Let's go, kid. Get to work.

192
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,042
Crack this big case.

193
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,628
Let's get you promoted
to Special Investigations.

194
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,213
Go, Tae-chun!

195
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,634
We, at Change Investment Partners,

196
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,637
invested capital
into high income funds per sector.

197
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,556
Each high income fund management company

198
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,642
executes investments coinciding
with policy objectives.

199
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,520
After Hong Kong's market close,
it's Shanghai, then London.

200
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,355
Six and a half hours later, New York.

201
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,401
Three hours later,
it's Seoul, Tokyo, and Sydney.

202
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,821
Our fund investments move
around the clock.

203
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,740
<i>Myung managed these men through CEO Oh,</i>

204
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,867
<i>all equal in rank to the district chief.</i>

205
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:32,581
<i>When you want to make a deal,</i>
<i>you must hit the core of their desires.</i>

206
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,583
…we find flexible solutions.

207
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,552
You get to a certain position,
then you get easy money, right?

208
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,305
You have connections
and plenty of information.

209
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,265
But the question is,

210
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,725
can you use that money

211
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,645
without drawing unwanted attention?

212
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,232
Eton College in London.

213
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,776
Collingwood School in Vancouver.

214
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,488
Yew Chung in Beijing.

215
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:09,284
Your children studying overseas
can draw any amount of money,

216
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,745
whenever and wherever they are.

217
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,665
You all have been subjected to
financial investigations.

218
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,916
I assume you know it well.

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,296
It may take time to dig through
Myung's borrowed-name accounts,

220
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,633
but it's bound to be exposed
with strong intent.

221
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,218
I believe that's why you've always been

222
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,679
slightly anxious and uncomfortable inside.

223
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,266
But our offshore mutual funds…

224
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,853
are impossible to trace.

225
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,940
Unlimited foreign exchange transactions.

226
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,151
The lowest tax rate in the world.

227
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,488
Whatever confirmation hearing you face,

228
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:51,159
we promise you won't need
to publicly disclose your wealth increase.

229
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:55,580
We understand the basic difference
between your fund and Myung's.

230
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,874
But…

231
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,084
Sir.

232
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,962
I ordered the inspection
against Hwang as you asked,

233
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,383
but isn't he too valuable to just rid of?

234
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,345
Look, Director of Inspection.

235
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,972
Think of the Prosecution as a whole.

236
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:17,227
Keeping someone marred by the press
is a burden to the institution.

237
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,403
I think our faultless Chief Park
would be great as his successor, no?

238
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,448
I'm Chief Park Jeong-su.
Thank you for your consideration.

239
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,311
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER
OF HUMANE RESPECT

240
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,113
Did I come too early?

241
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,615
Ma'am, your visitation is delayed
by 30 minutes.

242
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,743
Apparently, someone else is visiting him.

243
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,120
Who is it?

244
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,205
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
DETENTION CENTER

245
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,249
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS,
WE'LL HELP

246
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,380
Been a while, Chairman.

247
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:31,509
Well, look who it is.
It's Yong, our Manager Eun!

248
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:40,977
Kid, why don't you ever visit me
during the holidays?

249
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,147
You sure lack manners.

250
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,775
It's good to see you're healthy.

251
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,693
How is your health?

252
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,657
I heard you got
into a pretty bad car accident.

253
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,165
I have to outlive you, no?

254
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,210
I'm a lot younger and much richer.

255
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:09,756
If that's the case,
live like a king in the pastures.

256
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,383
Why'd you crawl back here?

257
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,598
I can't stand being indebted to someone,
so I came to pay my dues,

258
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,308
and to exact revenge.

259
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,643
That so?

260
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:28,316
You think you can pull it off
with the kid prosecutor?

261
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:34,197
You can't indict me
with misappropriation and malpractice.

262
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,201
I'll pay some fine, then it'll be over.

263
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,247
I learned more from you
than just money business, didn't I?

264
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,921
I purchased one too.

265
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,717
Oh, one moment.

266
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:03,601
Apparently, the suspect evaluation's done.

267
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,854
The court has issued the warrant.

268
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,105
What?

269
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,025
Chairman.

270
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,612
You should take this chance
and do some self-reflection.

271
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,825
Meanwhile, I'll dig up the wealth
you illegally stashed

272
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,660
with the kid prosecutor.

273
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,498
Let me be a patriot.

274
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,167
I'll retrieve your money
and aid the government funds.

275
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,130
Farewell.

276
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,028
INCOMING CALL

277
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,446
HWANG GI-SEOK,
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS

278
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,243
Hello, Gi-seok.

279
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,787
Why the hell is the arrest warrant issued?

280
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,498
Gi-seok, what's all the rage?

281
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:11,169
<i>The thing is,</i>
<i>the evidence was pretty overwhelming.</i>

282
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,756
-What, you bastard?
-<i>Come on, Gi-seok.</i>

283
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:19,344
Stop bugging me with unnecessary matters
and get ready to be inspected.

284
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,973
<i>Hey, if you open a law firm,</i>
<i>I'll get you a large bouquet.</i>

285
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,185
Are you sure you won't regret
what you just said?

286
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,228
I've been in regret for a long time.

287
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,440
I lost the deposit on that apartment
and canceled the contract.

288
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:36,819
I hear there may be changes
during the next promotional season.

289
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,697
You can't--

290
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,993
Chief Hwang Gi-seok.

291
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,954
Supreme Prosecutors' Office, here.

292
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,038
SUSPENSION ORDER

293
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,498
As of this moment, you are suspended

294
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,750
<i>from all of your duties</i>
<i>until the inspection is over.</i>

295
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,103
LET'S LIVE A CHEERFUL
AND ORDERLY LIFE

296
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,980
EVIL BEGETS SIN,
GOOD BEGETS BLESSING

297
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,609
PATIENCE IS THE BEST MEDICINE
FOR ANY AFFLICTION

298
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,200
You go ahead. I'll catch up soon.

299
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,284
Yes, ma'am.

300
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,457
EARN TRUST WITH KIND WORDS

301
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,460
He seems healthy.

302
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,796
If you were by his side,

303
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,673
this wouldn't have happened.

304
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,384
You knew we weren't going to last long.

305
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,054
That's why I liked you.

306
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,348
When it comes to money,

307
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,268
you're practically reflections
of each other,

308
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,938
but you two differ
in how you treat your family.

309
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,652
Yes, you weren't like your father either.

310
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,532
That's why I plan to protect my family.

311
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,911
I guess our relationship
is an ill-fated one after all.

312
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,207
See you around.

313
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,059
Heard the warrant was issued, right?

314
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:34,187
Well, our Chairman is fucked.

315
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,399
And I'm royally fucked.

316
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:42,403
You're a lawyer and a veteran prosecutor,
so you'd know.

317
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,322
Might as well admit your crimes.

318
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,241
Wouldn't it better to cooperate?

319
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,747
Look here.

320
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,084
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

321
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,378
-Yes?
-You beat up a teacher at school, right?

322
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,800
You beat him up with a chair,
got him hospitalized for… 8 weeks?

323
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,093
Anyhow.

324
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,054
Though you were a minor,
it was a severe crime.

325
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,765
You should've gone to juvie
for at least two years.

326
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,893
The prosecutor who got you out?

327
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,521
It was me.

328
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,693
Wow, now that I think about it,

329
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:25,738
we have a debt to settle.

330
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:30,159
Let's face it. If weren't for me,
you'd be in and out of juvie.

331
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:34,455
It could've been you sitting here
in my place, no?

332
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,463
Since you sure know
how to bribe and be bribed.

333
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,052
I understand you took a hefty sum
back then.

334
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,638
Wow, you know me so well.

335
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,058
Speaking of,

336
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,937
tell your uncle this.

337
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,898
Tell him to pay me a visit.

338
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,609
We can work out a good deal again.

339
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,825
I'll give you all the testimony you want.

340
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,410
Okay?

341
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,588
This is the testimony
I gave with Assemblyman Baek

342
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,923
at the press conference,
regarding the scandal.

343
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:29,760
That's a timeline of the conspiracy

344
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,470
I partook with Hwang.

345
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,390
Are these good for burden of proof?

346
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,685
The tampered files are
under forensic inspection.

347
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,438
Just bring them here.
We'll do the forensics.

348
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:46,027
I don't trust the Prosecution,
so I gave it to a reputable institution.

349
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,614
I'll submit more evidence,
just so there aren't any issues.

350
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,949
All right, good going.

351
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,327
No wonder you were top of your class.

352
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,078
You can return to your post.

353
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,582
You won't be a co-conspirator
in the Bluenet case,

354
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,293
but a victim
in the evidence fabrication incident.

355
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,421
Your attitude is proof enough to me
you're born to be a prosecutor.

356
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,382
Next time,
fight for justice as a prosecutor.

357
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,968
It's been rough for you.
You deserve the reward.

358
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,058
No, I don't deserve it.

359
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,984
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
INTERROGATION ROOM

360
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,570
Damn it, that weasel.

361
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:33,282
How dare he attempt to switch sides
and strike a deal in his favor?

362
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,993
No way.
We have enough evidence without his help.

363
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,580
No, he was the one caught red-handed.

364
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,626
Lee's testimony is crucial
if you want to make

365
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,586
the connection between Myung and Hwang.

366
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,422
You know Rambo's case is in limbo, right?

367
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:52,343
So, I should take the weasel's dirty deal?

368
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,095
Of course.

369
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,138
You never know
with Special Investigations.

370
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,808
Look, Chairman Myung is arrested.

371
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,768
Hwang's past is now out in the open.

372
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,271
The atmosphere at Prosecution
has changed overnight.

373
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,189
What do we know for sure?

374
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,440
We have the upper hand?

375
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,317
No!

376
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,946
This whole thing
can be overturned overnight.

377
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,533
So, you have to play the trump card

378
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,118
while you have the upper hand.

379
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,578
Geez.

380
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,086
Huh?

381
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:40,516
JUSTICE TO SOCIETY,
HAPPINESS TO THE PEOPLE

382
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,813
<i>The acquittal awarded by the court today</i>

383
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,149
marks the beginning of a new fight.

384
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:52,778
We are going to expose the truth
behind this prosecutorial misconduct.

385
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:57,825
So Mrs. Yoon and I,
we will fight to the end.

386
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,580
Doesn't suit your taste?

387
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,667
No, it's good.

388
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,130
It's been a while
since my daughter made me dinner.

389
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,631
Then, why aren't you eating?

390
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,137
Mom, how about you rest for a bit?

391
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,182
You must be worn out
from spending time inside.

392
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,059
If you go around with Minister Son--

393
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,894
I felt so wronged.

394
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:30,691
It's unfair that I was imprisoned
for something I didn't do.

395
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,860
The company is in shambles because of me.

396
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,821
My friends have been harassed
because of me.

397
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:40,493
I was treated like a sinner,
subjected to an insulting investigation.

398
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,833
Still, I withstood it in prayer.

399
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,378
But still,

400
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,298
they accused me of fabricating the ledger.

401
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,259
I really wanted to die.

402
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm scared.

403
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,184
I'm so scared to fight again,

404
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,437
but if I don't want someone else
to suffer like I did.

405
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,897
I have to fight back.

406
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,485
No, you just think about you.

407
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,822
You're not even a politician like Mr. Son.

408
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,826
But I'm a prosecutor's mother.

409
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,621
I can't tell you to be
a righteous prosecutor,

410
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,749
and disregard the truth myself.

411
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:37,258
Don't worry. This isn't enough to faze me.

412
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:42,054
I'm going to enjoy this meal you cooked
and fight to the end.

413
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,516
Let's eat.

414
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,194
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

415
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:05,453
THIS PERSON WISHES TO RESIGN
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS…

416
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,249
Miss Park Joon-gyeong.

417
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,293
We're from
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

418
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,920
We begin the interrogation

419
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,798
for forgery of private documents,
and the obstruction of justice.

420
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,426
These documents you handed over
to Special Investigations.

421
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,804
Were you the one who forged them?

422
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,404
Prosecutor Park, you may go.

423
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,452
Your mother has passed away.

424
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:32,706
EVIDENCE COLLECTED

425
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,167
<i>I'm the one who forged…</i>

426
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,171
<i>the bribery document. Forgive me.</i>

427
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,259
<i>I'll take all the blame.</i>

428
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,687
Sorry for the wait.

429
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:59,441
It's been hectic,
since being promoted to Chief.

430
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,198
I'm sorry I couldn't attend
your mother's funeral.

431
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:07,783
But…

432
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,620
why did you want to meet here?

433
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,457
I checked the visitors' log
the day my mother died.

434
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,502
Huh?

435
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,089
While I was interrogated
at Supreme Prosecutions,

436
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,341
my mother was also here.

437
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,551
It was you, right?

438
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,846
What did you say to her?

439
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,642
Did you threaten my mom,
while you had me locked in there?

440
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:34,768
Are you…

441
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,771
interrogating me?

442
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,066
I won't forgive you.

443
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,445
I'm going to fight to the end

444
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,948
to reveal the truth
about your true colors.

445
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,241
What gives you the right?

446
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,077
Park Joon-gyeong.

447
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,247
The charges against you
for evidence fabrication…

448
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:58,000
We're sweeping it under the rug,
since your mother passed.

449
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,543
You're family to us.

450
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:03,213
We don't see the point
in investigating someone who's passed.

451
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:04,673
But, what now?

452
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,301
Reveal what?

453
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,895
I heard you resigned.

454
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:21,940
Good thinking.

455
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:27,029
Join a law firm somewhere, and stay quiet.

456
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,635
Hello, Miss Park.

457
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,471
What brings you here?

458
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,517
Oh, I heard you were returning
to Prosecution.

459
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,561
-Is that why you're here?
-I'm here to see you.

460
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:01,939
Me?

461
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:06,318
I gave it a lot of thought once I heard
I could return to the Prosecution.

462
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:09,029
My father died
when I was in middle school.

463
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:11,573
Since then,
my sole dream was to fight for the weak

464
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,034
and become a righteous prosecutor.

465
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,161
Come back.

466
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:17,913
If you join us,

467
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,582
I think you'll be of great help
to the investigation.

468
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,840
I wanted to give this to you.

469
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,093
What is this?

470
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:37,599
A fountain pen?
Is it a recorder of some sort?

471
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,768
Does this have some important transcript?

472
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,604
Yong gave this to me
before he left for Mongolia.

473
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,483
He told me to use this pen to sign papers

474
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:49,403
incriminating the bad guys.

475
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,742
So, why are you giving this to me?

476
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,536
I'm a co-conspirator
in Hwang's evidence fabrication case.

477
00:33:58,245 --> 00:33:59,997
I can't be a prosecutor anymore.

478
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,293
I wish you the best,
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

479
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:16,472
What do you do when you have
to be a monster to fight the monsters?

480
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,309
Just now,

481
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,437
a man named Lee Su-dong offered
to do a filthy deal with me.

482
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,439
What do I do in these situations?

483
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,713
Oh, you're home.

484
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:57,554
Oh, that was an accident.

485
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,649
What kind of man is your father?

486
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,442
Huh?

487
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,444
I mean…

488
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,239
He got greedy over a petty sum,
and now what?

489
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,493
How long is he going to live that way?

490
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,577
Huh?

491
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:24,540
Until when is he going to live
like a lowlife?

492
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,667
Until when?

493
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,046
Until when?

494
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,741
Do you feel better now?

495
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,968
You didn't have to hurt your hand.

496
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:23,932
Sorry.

497
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:33,942
You know why I chose you, right?

498
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,448
We could have bought any house
with my dad's money.

499
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,325
The thing is,

500
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,872
money can't buy
the kind of house I want to live in.

501
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,960
The Blue House.

502
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:56,673
Your father-in-law

503
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,385
is still someone we need.

504
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,972
The money he made out of greed

505
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,058
is why you've risen so high.

506
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,897
But everyone we bought with money
has betrayed us.

507
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,941
So put them back in their place.

508
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,528
What can we do now?

509
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,866
I told Dad to take care of them himself.

510
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,375
-Himself?
-Yeah.

511
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,294
So you're saying,

512
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,548
the bastard, Oh Chang-hyeon betrayed me

513
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,594
and introduced Eun Yong
to the seniors of the Supreme Office?

514
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:45,055
-Is that it?
-Yes.

515
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:54,856
Attorney Shim.

516
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,485
I need to call someone.

517
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:02,072
Help me make calls at my convenience
for when I return to prison.

518
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,492
I'll speak to the prison ward.

519
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:07,995
Okay.

520
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,045
Enjoyed your dinner?

521
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,632
Shall we resume the interrogation?

522
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,094
I don't feel well.

523
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,221
Let's call it a day.

524
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,309
You went to the bathroom for three hours.

525
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:32,853
You took two hours to eat.

526
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,981
I can't let you go just yet.

527
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,442
Let's confirm a few things--

528
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,236
Attorney Shim,

529
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,989
make a call to your friend,
that district prosecutor.

530
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,242
This prosecutor is ignoring
the rights of the suspect

531
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,745
and wants to press on
with the investigation.

532
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,622
Mr. Jang, let's call it a day.

533
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,754
How long do you think
you'll be able to avoid this?

534
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:04,509
How long do you think I'll stay in here?

535
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,513
As long as your list of sins.

536
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,354
I heard Eun Yong is your uncle.

537
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,899
My, my.

538
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,444
Kid prosecutor,
you may have won the arrest warrant

539
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,404
with your uncle's help.

540
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,699
Better get off your high horse.

541
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,660
The world

542
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,288
isn't as easy as you think.

543
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,211
Lee Su-dong was caught red-handed.

544
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,630
Even the courts

545
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,507
-acknowledge your involvement--
-So…

546
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,885
What did Lee Su-dong say?

547
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:52,557
Did he testify that I gave him the orders?

548
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,771
Investigate according to your laws.

549
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,565
I'm clean.

550
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,109
I have no problems.

551
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,618
Lee Su-dong suggested a deal to Tae-chun?

552
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,954
He's a lawyer himself,

553
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:17,541
so he knows his testimony is most critical
to get Myung indicted.

554
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,210
Lee Su-dong…

555
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,462
He is the type of man who can be bought.

556
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:25,966
Let's wait it out.

557
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:28,718
Tae-chun has to decide

558
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:32,139
what kind of prosecutor he wants to be.
That way he makes no regrets.

559
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,601
For how long will <i>you</i> live in regret?

560
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,521
I heard you refused to return
to Prosecution.

561
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,984
I have to be responsible for my actions.

562
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,405
I spoke to the police,

563
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,074
they say Lee Jin-ho disappeared
from the hospital.

564
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,909
I thought he was in the ICU.

565
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:55,787
He was moved to the general ward,
since his state improved.

566
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,747
I think he took the chance to run.

567
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,251
Can you guess where he is?

568
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,090
If you want to find Jin-ho,

569
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,843
there are drug dealers
among Kim Seong-tae's boys.

570
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,846
If you look there, you'll find something.

571
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,723
Drugs?

572
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,686
Myung and Kim often used that method

573
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,812
to train the boys.

574
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,815
Jin-ho changed due to the drugs.

575
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,778
I should have taken care of him.

576
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,824
You can't take care of everyone.

577
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,744
In the end,
people make their own decision,

578
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,871
and they're held responsible for it.

579
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,331
No.

580
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,418
If Jin-ho had one good person
looking out for him,

581
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,670
he may have turned out different.

582
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,798
Just like how I changed,
thanks to your mother.

583
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,822
<i>Lee's testimony is crucial</i>
<i>if you want to make</i>

584
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,699
<i>the connection between Myung and Hwang.</i>

585
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:17,535
You know Rambo's case is in limbo, right?

586
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:21,456
So, I should take the weasel's dirty deal?

587
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,166
Of course.

588
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,252
You never know
with Special Investigations.

589
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,390
<i>I see you're not a prosecutor,</i>
<i>but just a legal professional.</i>

590
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,934
We have the evidence to prove a crime,

591
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:44,145
but you're looking through the books,
searching for reasons to disprove it.

592
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,647
I can see why Hwang likes you.

593
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:08,253
So, have you spoken to Mr. Eun?

594
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,674
I'll call him now.

595
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,510
Okay.

596
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,318
Hey, Tae-chun.

597
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,903
<i>Lee Su-dong says that if you visit him,</i>

598
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,239
he'll testify in my favor.

599
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,160
-<i>Really?</i>
-Mr. Eun.

600
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,453
<i>It's Lee Su-dong.</i>

601
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,040
<i>Hey, you know how we do things</i>
<i>around here.</i>

602
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,624
<i>Let's meet in person.</i>

603
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,298
Hey, Uncle.

604
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,469
Don't accept any of Lee Su-dong's offers.

605
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:06,728
I'm going to keep my promise
to become a prosecutor

606
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,522
who sees this investigation to the end.

607
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,817
Leave it to me from here.

608
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,281
Okay, will do.

609
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,078
UNCLE YONG, CALL ENDED

610
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,635
So you're an idiot?

611
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:58,655
<i>It's still a relief.</i>

612
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:02,909
So, Assemblyman Choi's secretary
confessed?

613
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:04,577
Yeah.

614
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,040
If you handle this well,

615
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:11,793
you're transferring
to Special Investigations.

616
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:13,586
Did your father say so?

617
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,715
Last week, he played golf
with the district chief.

618
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,226
Se-hui.

619
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,231
Did you tell your dad
that Assemblyman Choi's secretary

620
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,816
was giving me a headache?

621
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,530
He keeps saying,
he just got into a car accident,

622
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:44,242
but I've dealt with plenty cases like this
at Criminal Investigations.

623
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,328
He was physically beat up.

624
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,585
It was your father, right?

625
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:56,921
I asked him to do it.

626
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:02,051
If you fail this case,
you must tender your resignation, no?

627
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,599
Did you forget the promise you made me

628
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,518
when we got married?

629
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,742
Next time you discuss work with your dad--

630
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:29,871
Fine, I'll run it by you first.

631
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:36,628
Chief.

632
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:43,218
There was a meeting earlier today
at the Supreme Office.

633
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,513
