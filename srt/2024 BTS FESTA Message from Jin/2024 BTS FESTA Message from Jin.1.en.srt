1
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,583
Hello, ARMY

2
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,255
I'll say hello

3
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,506
Two, three, Bangtan

4
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,382
Hello

5
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,717
I'm Jin of BTS

6
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,852
ARMY!

7
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:08,029
I've finally returned to the home

8
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,198
that I missed so dearly

9
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,622
I'm so nervous right now

10
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,506
It feels like I'm debuting all over again

11
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,005
I can't even sing properly

12
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,439
My face is trembling
and my hands are shaking

13
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,386
I'm in total chaos

14
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,640
I was discharged from
the military yesterday, everyone

15
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:43,543
So things still feel a bit awkward

16
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,943
and my mindset's not fully back yet either

17
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,280
So if I make a mistake tonight
or don't do so well

18
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,410
I'd be grateful if you could
watch with kindness

19
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,876
It's also been a year and six months
since I last sang

20
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,856
so I kept my eyes closed on purpose

21
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,008
because I was worried I'd mess up
when I heard your cheers

22
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,470
Wow, this is really tough

23
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,722
Boys, where are you?

24
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,936
I miss you guys

25
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,190
I'll say hello one more time

26
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,149
Hi, ARMY

27
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,150
This is Jin!

28
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:36,242
And hello to all ARMY
watching online as well!

29
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,285
This is Jin

30
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,920
Be calm, my heart

31
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,214
Stop racing

32
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:57,722
I believe many ARMY were very happy

33
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,767
to hear the news that I'd be on stage tonight

34
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:06,397
I'm sure it made you all happy
and excited to be together again

35
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:12,653
I sent you monthly messages
the whole time, right?

36
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:18,242
But since we can be together
in person again

37
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:23,331
here is Seokjin in June 2024
greeting you directly!

38
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,540
Hi!

39
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,513
Thank you, thank you

40
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:45,978
There's so much I wanted to tell ARMY
when we met again

41
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:51,150
But now that we're actually here together

42
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,313
and with all your cheers and support
I'm starting to slowly feel at ease

43
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:58,993
I was...

44
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:01,827
really anxious down there

45
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,081
and shaking like crazy
They got it all on camera, by the way

46
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,957
so you'll be able to see it later

47
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,921
Now that I'm here, receiving all this
energy from you in person

48
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,758
I feel like it's enough for me
just seeing you all in front of me

49
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,594
ARMY, do you feel the same?

50
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,770
On that note, then...

51
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:28,396
why don't we greet each other
from a bit closer?

52
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,986
I'll start from this side

53
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,286
Hi!

54
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,833
Hi!

55
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,671
I missed you all so much

56
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,553
Right, this is the life I used to have

57
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,732
Hi!

58
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:29,248
You must have wondered
how I was doing

59
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:33,544
during the time we were apart

60
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,007
Well, I went to the military

61
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:44,472
I made a lot of friends there

62
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,475
and they were all really young

63
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,644
People beginning their service now
are twelve years younger than me

64
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,857
So when the new recruits would come in

65
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,942
I'd ask, "What year were you born?"

66
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,304
and they'd say, "I was born in 2004, sir!"

67
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:02,414
Wow...

68
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,116
"We're twelve years apart," I'd say

69
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,618
"Just call me Uncle"

70
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,455
"H-how could I, Sergeant Kim Seokjin?"

71
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,999
"Just call me Uncle, I'm telling you!"

72
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,626
"B-but... I can't..."

73
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,668
"Wow...

74
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,338
They're not following orders
What should I do with them?"

75
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,301
We'd joke around like that

76
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,180
We were all on very good terms

77
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:33,020
They even promised they wouldn't cry
when I got discharged

78
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,940
but they all ended up crying

79
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,400
so I felt sad and cried, too

80
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,030
There was one friend who said
he'd for sure grab onto my legs

81
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,407
and sob as if there was no tomorrow

82
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,535
but he didn't

83
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,454
I'm disappointed in you

84
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,252
Anyway, so that's how life was for me

85
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,588
On the other hand

86
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,674
I've also been curious
about how ARMY has been

87
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:07,488
and also about what kinds of things
have been going on out in the world

88
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,975
So let's take this time to catch up

89
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:17,606
and learn about everything that happened

90
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:21,527
while I was away

91
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,699
Since...

92
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,495
I got discharged just yesterday
I didn't have time to prepare a lot

93
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,455
I even forgot how to sing

94
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,586
Thank you, thank you for understanding

95
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:44,898
So, in order for me to adjust more quickly
to civilian life

96
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:47,595
since I've only been back for a day

97
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,639
I'm hoping ARMY will be able
to help me out a lot

98
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,640
Okay?

99
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,279
During our time away,
various "challenges" went viral on Earth

100
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,303
To quickly adapt to life back here
let's master these challenges

101
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,327
and make ARMY happy

102
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,244
Okay, everyone

103
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,706
Our first mission has arrived

104
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:22,296
"During our time away, various 'challenges'
went viral on Earth

105
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,078
To quickly adapt to life back here
let's master these challenges

106
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:29,511
and make ARMY happy!"

107
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,640
That's the mission, ARMY

108
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,018
There have been so many challenges, right?

109
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,831
Even my bandmates did some of them

110
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,526
and I've seen some online, too

111
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,404
As I was getting discharged, I thought

112
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:51,575
"I wonder if there's a challenge
ARMY would like to see me do"

113
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,121
But I also hoped you wouldn't have any

114
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,248
It's just too embarrassing!

115
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,792
Remember

116
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,587
I may look like this, but I'm 33 now

117
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:07,591
But, I'll still do them

118
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,802
and that's because I'm a professional

119
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,721
I'll do it!

120
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,934
So, my first mission is to
quickly learn some on the spot

121
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:21,230
and show them to you!

122
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:29,196
First, let's take a look
at what challenges were popular

123
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,800
There are a few I don't know, though

124
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,014
They never showed up in my algorithms
since I only get gaming videos

125
00:16:55,014 --> 00:17:00,310
I do know the "Slick Back" one
where you go like this...

126
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,770
And...

127
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,065
I know the "word spacing" challenge

128
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,068
And...

129
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,530
I know the "Queen Card" challenge

130
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,160
I know the "Cat on the Han River" challenge
and the "PoPiPo" challenge, too

131
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,578
Which one should I do, ARMY?

132
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,082
Pardon?

133
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,463
Then, let's combine ARMY's opinion

134
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,965
together with mine...

135
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,635
and choose one!

136
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,220
Let's see

137
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,934
Sorry I keep talking about the military

138
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,853
It's only been a day

139
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,565
But the guys would watch challenges
practically all day long

140
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,524
And they'd be like

141
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,893
"Sergeant Kim Seokjin
do you know the word spacing challenge?"

142
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,489
and would show me a few examples

143
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,116
Then I'd say to them

144
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,787
"Oh, but I don't really like
this kind of thing..."

145
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,205
But I think ARMY will enjoy it

146
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,749
so I'm going to give it a try!

147
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:11,520
[Word spacing challenge]

148
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,969
This one doesn't really require practice

149
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:20,599
So just give me the lines
and I'll give it a go right away

150
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,975
Okay, let's go

151
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,367
"Hey, you take it!"

152
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,412
"Hey, you take me"

153
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,092
Okay, let's try the next one

154
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,440
"Be on your way!"

155
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,904
"I'm your baby!"

156
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,368
Ah... I feel sad

157
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,369
Next one, please

158
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,677
"Come on... Give me a discount!"

159
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,725
"Give me a cookie!"

160
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,775
Next one, please!

161
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,160
j-hope would be great at this one

162
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,163
I'll try doing it like j-hope

163
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,625
"I am King Taejo!"

164
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,795
"Giant spider! Get it off meee!"

165
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,809
What do you think, ARMY?
Was that good enough?

166
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,771
Thank you

167
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,398
Wow, this is tough

168
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:39,154
But since I got ARMY's seal of approval
I'll move on to the next challenge

169
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:43,659
The second challenge is...

170
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,244
"that" one, everyone

171
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:49,470
["Cat on the Han River" challenge]

172
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:58,774
Sorry for yet another military story!

173
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,176
But the guys would keep
showing me videos

174
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,720
asking if I had seen them before

175
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,597
Then, they'd ask me to do it

176
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:12,020
So I'd say, "Nah, that's not me"
But tonight, I'll give it a try

177
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,693
I'm not too familiar with this one
so I'll watch it first

178
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,029
practice a bit, then try it

179
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,216
Okay, let's give this a shot!

180
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,168
ARMY, are you satisfied with that one?

181
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,923
Thank you for only making me do that once

182
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,137
Okay, now

183
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,855
You meanies...

184
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,276
Okay, if ARMY wants more

185
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,611
I'll do it!

186
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,738
This wasn't in my plan

187
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,323
but I'll do it once more

188
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,574
I'll go again

189
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,061
I tried my best, everyone

190
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,729
Let me off the hook now!

191
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,776
Thank you

192
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,071
Okay, now

193
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,656
Two challenges was a lot, right?

194
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,661
Or do you want more?

195
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,622
Are you sure?

196
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,959
Because I don't

197
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,338
But since ARMY wants more

198
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,464
I'll do

199
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,551
just one more!

200
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,016
When I was told about these challenges

201
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,228
I thought about which ones to do

202
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,025
What? Which one's "Sorry for being cute"?

203
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,282
Well, I already did enough cute ones

204
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,451
so... sorry!

205
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:18,498
I'm going to try one of the dance ones now

206
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,838
Not "Slick Back"

207
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,675
What was it...

208
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,095
I'm going to do
Jung Kook's "Seven" challenge

209
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:40,020
I've got to support my bandmates, right?

210
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,771
But I can't stress this enough

211
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:47,027
I just got discharged yesterday

212
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,225
And it's not like I could practice dancing
in front of all the other guys there

213
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,826
so I don't know it well

214
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,829
I watched Jung Kook's

215
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,500
and also Jimin's "Like Crazy"

216
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,543
I saw a couple of them

217
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,212
but I did see Jung Kook's first

218
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,713
so I'll just do his

219
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,550
I'll watch the video once
because I really don't know it well

220
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,053
Can you please show me the video
one more time?

221
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,747
One more time, please

222
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,234
Okay

223
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,656
It's a bit embarrassing to do this alone

224
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,243
so can I have my dancers join me?

225
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,079
Dancers, please come on up!

226
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,666
Welcome

227
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,763
I really hope

228
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,516
I can get this right in one go

229
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,685
Okay, here I go!

230
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:28,438
I managed to memorize it and not mess up

231
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,941
One more time?

232
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,861
If I do it once more, I might mess up

233
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,363
Then I'd have to do it again

234
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,572
and then again

235
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:41,868
We can't spend all our time
doing only this, right?

236
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,788
You really want it?

237
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,377
Okay, if you want it
I guess I have no choice

238
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,121
Wow

239
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,956
I hope they somehow edit this one out

240
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,710
and only keep the previous takes

241
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,716
Thank you, ARMY

242
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,968
Will you count this as a success?

243
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,724
I'll send a video of this
to Jung Kook later

244
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,767
and ask him how I did

245
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:55,108
I think we'll wrap up the challenges here

246
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:59,362
I still have a lot of missions left to do

247
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,283
But are you satisfied
with what we've done so far, ARMY?

248
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,704
But, you know...

249
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,833
There are

250
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,793
so many challenges out there

251
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:19,174
And although I didn't start it

252
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,135
one of my songs did become a challenge

253
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:32,187
This is something I was planning on
keeping sealed away forever...

254
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,024
But would you like to see it?

255
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,238
Oh, and for the "eotteohari" part

256
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:46,326
it'd be nice if you could all sing along

257
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,078
Okay then, here I go

258
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,529
Thank you

259
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:18,048
Incoming message

260
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:24,239
Hello.
I'll keep this short. I miss you.
I miss you very much so

261
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:27,380
I now have about a year to go.
Are you enjoying my release
from last month, "RPWP"?

262
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:30,985
How are you all doing?
Time feels so sluggish when I anticipate our reunion

263
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,113
but I'm holding on. With my tenor saxophone...
I'll play "Dynamite" for you when I return!

264
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:39,422
Stay healthy throughout this scorching summer.
Being thrusted into such new environment got me
discovering emotions I never new existed

265
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:44,006
And it makes me think about how Jin must have felt
being the very first one to go.
Great job for making it, and congrats!

266
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:48,154
Please give ARMY lots of love on my behalf.
And I'm sorry to entrust you with this huge task

267
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:51,672
But hey, Hoseok will be joining you soon, too!

268
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:56,534
My love for ARMY is just as resolute as our first day.
How even wilder and more radiant you must be
by the time I see you again

269
00:32:56,578 --> 00:33:00,825
I believe even this heartache we're experiencing
is all there for a reason

270
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:04,990
If my heart aches, so be it. I'll persevere.
It's been 11 years. It's just 1 year more

271
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:09,230
"ARMY!" I haven't called you like this in a while.
Our love and history aren't going anywhere.
I love you!

272
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:12,824
Signed, Namjoon
May of 2024

273
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:16,826
Hi. This is Jin.
How are you all. It's been a while

274
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:21,051
I wanted to check in with you more
but circumstances made it difficult.
I am very sorry

275
00:33:21,076 --> 00:33:25,276
My discharge day is coming up.
I'm so nervous and excited haha

276
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:29,634
I heard my members worked hard
to make you happy while I was away.
I knew I could count on them...

277
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:33,327
Now it's my turn to make you happy.

278
00:33:33,352 --> 00:33:38,418
I'm on my own so it might not be enough
but I'll try my very best

279
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:43,109
I've been planning it for a year now.
Just wait until I'm discharged, and
I'll show you one by one

280
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:47,334
Thank you for being with us
through thick and thin
ARMY, I love you!

281
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:52,493
P.S. Keep up the good work, kiddos!

282
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:57,802
Hey ARMY! This is SUGA!

283
00:33:57,826 --> 00:34:02,126
Long time no see! It feels almost a bit
awkward to be writing to you like this haha

284
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:06,623
I'm doing very well.
The movie has been out, I got through
the training center

285
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:10,947
just keeping myself super busy.
I hope ARMY has been doing well, too!

286
00:34:10,972 --> 00:34:15,272
I can't believe I'm spending this June 13
without ARMY, but I'm relieved to know
that Jin will keep you company hehe

287
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:19,597
Please celebrate this year's June 13 as well.
Keep the festivities coming!

288
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:23,922
I'm counting down the days I'll be
able to join you again, too!

289
00:34:23,947 --> 00:34:28,247
Always stay safe, and never feel discouraged.
Let's look forward to the day we'll meet again!

290
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:32,572
I miss you so much, ARMY!
See you soon! Bye!!

291
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:38,752
Hi ARMY! How you all doing?

292
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:44,342
I'm spending my days as Sergeant Jeong Hoseok
and a squad leader, working out to stay in shape
because my discharge is coming up in 4 months

293
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,867
and even practicing some
conversational English to keep myself busy

294
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:52,426
I don't know if you would agree on this
but I think I've gotten a bit calmer

295
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:57,250
Perhaps I've truly grown up??
Ha!! ← Judging from this, perhaps not

296
00:34:57,548 --> 00:35:03,539
June came in what felt like a blink of an eye.
I'm sure it's so much better with Jin finally with you.
It's also a reminder that our reunion is approaching

297
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:08,004
That's enough of me.
I want to hear from YOU now

298
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:10,682
How have you been?

299
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,707
You aren't skipping meals, are you?

300
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:14,732
Getting quality sleep?

301
00:35:14,757 --> 00:35:17,156
Latest hobbies or interests?

302
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,114
How have your days been without us?

303
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:23,606
What do you want to say
when you see us?

304
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:27,632
And be honest.
Have you "cheated" or not?

305
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:30,789
Have you or have you not run with Sun-jae?

306
00:35:30,814 --> 00:35:34,778
Ever since turning 30, I'm just getting
more curious by the day!

307
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:39,111
Or maybe it's just me wanting to hear from you more?
Because the day we'll meet again is so near?

308
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,459
I'm so anxious...

309
00:35:42,484 --> 00:35:47,188
To tell you the truth...
Time has been passing slower lately

310
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:52,456
I've been dreaming quite a bit...
Maybe I'm getting too ahead of myself

311
00:35:52,481 --> 00:35:57,944
I don't know how well I'm conveying
my emotions through this letter

312
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:03,103
But I hope you can feel what this
Sergeant Jeong Hoseok feels right now!

313
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:07,524
I miss you!
I wanna see you!

314
00:36:07,658 --> 00:36:13,145
Stay healthy, enjoy June
and let's count the days until October!
See you then!

315
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,971
I love you!
Your hope

316
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:24,527
P.S. Looking forward to 1 year from now on!
Love u "BTS," love u "ARMY"

317
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:31,403
To. ARMY
ARMY, this is Jimin
Long time, no see!

318
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:35,482
I'm just gonna pour my heart here!
ARMY... I miss you so much

319
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:40,557
It really isn't easy hehehe
I'm spending every day imagining
how it'd feel to meet you again

320
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:44,581
What color should my hair be?
I should be more fit by then, right?

321
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:48,605
How long should my hair be?
What earrings should I wear? What clothes?

322
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:52,629
What song should I sing?
My heart beats so fast
when I think of these things at night

323
00:36:52,653 --> 00:36:56,653
it keeps me awake.
Just thinking of how amazing it must feel

324
00:36:56,677 --> 00:37:00,677
How are you all?
Are you not skipping meals?
Getting some exercise?

325
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:04,701
Who am I kidding, of course you aren't!
Hehehehe (You really have to, though)

326
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:08,725
Has anything bad happened?
If it did, I hope it's still manageable

327
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:12,749
ARMY needs to be happy
And I need to make you happy
which is why it's frustrating

328
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:16,773
But I'm doing quite well, so don't you worry
and Jin is getting discharged real soon!

329
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:20,797
Have fun with Jin for now.
Then before you know it,
we will return to you one by one

330
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:24,821
Let's all gather around
embrace one another
and have the time of our lives

331
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:28,845
I'll catch up with you in the next letter.
I love you, ARMY. Take care!
- Jimin

332
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:36,316
ARMY! You have no idea how much I miss you
Ha... How are you all doing?

333
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,340
I'm eating well, sleeping well, training well
living a pretty healthy life overall

334
00:37:40,364 --> 00:37:45,439
I'm receiving positive energy from
all these young men, and learning so much
from these new experiences

335
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:48,891
Not to brag, but I've placed first
a couple of times too lol

336
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:53,225
I seem to have a knack for gun shooting!
I got lots of compliments and I'm learning
judo and jiu-jitsu from my brothers in arms!

337
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,666
I feel like a new man!
I'm grateful that I can train alongside these men,
though I'm barely catching up

338
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:01,691
It's been super motivating.
There have been minor injuries
but I promise I won't push myself too far!

339
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:04,484
I'm just having a blast, that's all.
You feel me? Hehe

340
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:08,508
In my free time, I just find a corner
and... dance.
I can't help myself!

341
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:12,532
I don't want to lose my edge,
so I've been practicing lightly
every now and then!

342
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:16,556
I also overcame my fear of heights.
It wasn't so bad, after all!
Just kidding, it was. But I got through it

343
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,580
Now that I've told you I'm doing well
so should ARMY

344
00:38:20,604 --> 00:38:23,604
Don't ever get sick,
don't ever feel uneasy

345
00:38:23,629 --> 00:38:27,065
I know we're always worried sick
about one another, but let's not be.
We'll meet again real soon

346
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:31,927
Let's pour our hearts out when that day comes!
I miss you and love you so much.
I purple you to the moon and back. Bye!

347
00:38:34,284 --> 00:38:36,773
Dear ARMY
Hello, this is Jung Kook

348
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:40,292
It's been forever since I wrote a letter.
Excuse my handwriting,
it seems to have gotten worse lol

349
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:44,692
ARMY! I'm doing quite well
It's not always easy but I'm powering through
thinking of the day I'll see you again

350
00:38:44,717 --> 00:38:48,832
Sometimes, I forget my troubles
when I think back to some of our
funny memories, hehe

351
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:53,094
Did you like the fan song "Never Let Go"?
Even while recording
I knew this had to become a fan song

352
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,919
I hope my message came through
loud and clear haha

353
00:38:56,944 --> 00:39:00,722
I wanted to perform it for you too
but I didn't have the time to put it into action

354
00:39:00,747 --> 00:39:04,852
I really want to make it happen one day though
(not that anything has been prepared as of now)

355
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:08,676
But I would really love to...
And listen to your cheers...
And perform great songs again...

356
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,500
The freezing winter is finally behind us
and summer isn't even here yet,
but here I am, wishing winter was here already

357
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:16,324
Time is so slow! Lol
I must miss you all too much

358
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:20,148
But I should make the most of my days
and before we know it,
I would be standing before you

359
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:25,221
So power to us! Anyway, ARMY!
Stay healthy and safe until we meet again!
That way, we can enjoy our reunion in full!

360
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:28,327
I miss you so much.
And I love you so much!

361
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:32,152
My letter looks so bad, though lol
Well, I'll see you again! Good bye!
- Jung kook

Message from Namjoon, Seokjin, Yoongi
Hoseok, Jimin, Taehyung, Jung Kook
On June 13, 2024

363
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,571
Hello again, everyone

364
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,409
I'm back after changing

365
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:20,334
It's so nice singing "Super Tuna"
together with all of you

366
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,337
But, still...

367
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,382
I'll be sealing this song away forever

368
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,805
I felt something was missing, though

369
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,683
and asked Kye Beom-ju
with this song

370
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,561
"Hurry and make a second verse, please"

371
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,064
And that's why I sang a second verse tonight

372
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:45,818
I'll be releasing the full track soon

373
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,655
I hope?

374
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:55,494
We also received some warm messages
from the other six members just now

375
00:40:55,494 --> 00:41:00,166
And they're all working hard
in their respective places

376
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,586
Tonight's a special night for us, isn't it?

377
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:08,799
I think that's why the members
wrote those messages for ARMY

378
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,553
Everyone will return soon

379
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,931
and we'll all be together again

380
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,560
I'm looking forward to it so much as well

381
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,770
and I hope they come back soon

382
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,355
Come back, guys!

383
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,024
ARMY, you feel the same, right?

384
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:33,478
What's mukbang without Eat Jin?

385
00:41:33,503 --> 00:41:35,383
Enjoy all the Earth foods you've been craving
and catch up with the latest food trends

386
00:41:35,408 --> 00:41:36,908
Show them Eat Jin is back!

387
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,957
ARMY, our second mission has arrived!

388
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:45,211
And what's something I've been doing
since a while back?

389
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,046
Yes, it's none other than

390
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,798
"Eat Jin," my mukbang content

391
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,051
It's been quite a while

392
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,970
since I've showed myself
enjoying food to ARMY

393
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,796
so for the second mission

394
00:41:57,821 --> 00:42:01,758
I'll be doing an "Eat Jin" for ARMY

395
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:04,843
and selfishly eat on my own

396
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,861
Tonight's menu

397
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,382
will be something

398
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:18,869
that I really missed and craved

399
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:26,585
I also picked a viral food
that I didn't get to try

400
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,673
Let's have a look

401
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,429
Okay

402
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:45,521
We have tanghulu here

403
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,607
and we have tuna

404
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:57,449
There are some drinks, as well

405
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,705
I'll enjoy these delicious foods

406
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,789
for all of you

407
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,917
I'm quite nervous, though
so I'm not sure if I can eat well

408
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:11,589
But since it's part of the mission
I'll give it a try

409
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,592
I just sang "Super Tuna"

410
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,262
And while wondering what to eat
for "Eat Jin" tonight

411
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,348
I ended up choosing tuna

412
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,725
That's okay with you, right?

413
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:31,317
This is fresh tuna ordered this morning
and it just arrived now

414
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,862
The tuna was all like, "Pick me, pick me!"
and came straight from the East Sea

415
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,155
For real!

416
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,283
I apologize

417
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,829
Was that too much of a dad joke?

418
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:47,875
Okay

419
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,879
In addition to the tuna

420
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,132
I'll be drinking some zero-calorie sodas

421
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,593
They're really popular these days, right?

422
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,429
I always have them stocked up at home, too

423
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,474
I have boxes of them stacked up

424
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,603
There are some I know
and some I haven't tried yet

425
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,481
so I've prepared these for tonight as well

426
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,692
And as for the dessert...

427
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:17,821
This started trending
after I went to the military

428
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,865
so I haven't had much of it

429
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,952
I think it was when I became a sergeant

430
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,872
One of my unit members gave me some
saying, "Try some of this!"

431
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,792
and I told him
"No, I don't eat stuff like that"

432
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,378
But I had it, and it was pretty good

433
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,422
So tonight will be my second
or third time eating it

434
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,926
I'll enjoy it for you

435
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,887
and I'll describe the taste for you, too

436
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,685
I can't believe I'm doing this live

437
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,466
I'll start with the tuna

438
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,894
Sorry, I won't be sharing tonight

439
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,406
The tuna lovers here
might criticize me for doing this

440
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,534
but I prefer chojang with my tuna

441
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,168
Hey now, we all have our preferences
No need to boo, right?

442
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,620
It's...

443
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,914
a very luxurious

444
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:37,336
elegant, and great-tasting tuna

445
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,466
Now, I'll try a different part of the tuna

446
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,892
This isn't really "in" anymore
but here's some ASMR

447
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,630
Never thought I'd get applauded for eating

448
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,342
Let's try a drink now

449
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,826
Someone put sesame seeds in the chojang

450
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,702
One moment, please

451
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,791
It's not okay for me

452
00:48:48,363 --> 00:48:50,156
Wait, but all of these are sweet

453
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:53,660
I'll just try a small one, then

454
00:49:08,424 --> 00:49:10,190
Okay, I get why these are popular

455
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:12,512
It's a very stimulating taste

456
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:16,891
It's sticking to my teeth, though

457
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,565
I'm going to try just one more

458
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:44,752
We'll be here till midnight
if I eat everything

459
00:49:49,966 --> 00:49:52,635
You all have school and work tomorrow

460
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:55,305
You don't?

461
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:00,018
Okay

462
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:02,228
That was a great meal

463
00:50:03,229 --> 00:50:05,273
Yes, one more sip since I'm thirsty

464
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:23,207
My stomach's not really full

465
00:50:23,207 --> 00:50:26,419
but ARMY, you're always
my favorite people to eat with

466
00:50:28,296 --> 00:50:33,217
Thanks to you, I had a great meal

467
00:50:33,217 --> 00:50:38,514
And although I didn't eat that much
just now

468
00:50:38,514 --> 00:50:41,309
did you still enjoy
the return of "Eat Jin"?

469
00:50:43,353 --> 00:50:47,148
This is all I was able to prepare
since I didn't have much time

470
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:52,779
but next time I'm back from the military
I'll prepare something even better

471
00:50:59,035 --> 00:51:02,664
And I think some of you may be eating

472
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:07,585
along to this "Eat Jin" segment

473
00:51:07,585 --> 00:51:10,129
I hope you enjoy your food
and I'd appreciate it

474
00:51:10,129 --> 00:51:14,550
if you could think of me eating
while you enjoy your meal

475
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,730
We did challenges tonight

476
00:51:29,357 --> 00:51:32,860
and "Eat Jin" too, and through that

477
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,905
we made up for some of the time
we've been apart

478
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:39,826
But unfortunately
it's already time to wrap things up

479
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:44,038
Did you have fun tonight, ARMY?

480
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:52,422
Seeing so many ARMY
enjoying themselves makes me realize

481
00:51:52,422 --> 00:51:57,635
"Yes, this is where I belong"

482
00:51:57,635 --> 00:51:59,429
"This is my home"

483
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:03,224
I was reminded of that

484
00:52:05,143 --> 00:52:07,687
Before we part ways tonight

485
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:13,901
I'd like to express my feelings to you

486
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:18,156
one more time, ARMY

487
00:52:24,287 --> 00:52:29,834
I had a few military leaves
so when I'd go see our label

488
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:34,756
And they asked me
what I wanted to do for June 13th

489
00:52:36,132 --> 00:52:41,262
I told them, "This is definitely
something I have to do

490
00:52:41,262 --> 00:52:43,222
since all the others are away

491
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,611
Since all the others are away

492
00:52:56,611 --> 00:53:00,239
even if I can't prepare anything in advance

493
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:03,451
and have to prepare everything
on the day of the event

494
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:07,079
this is definitely something I have to do"

495
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:11,667
As soon as the clock struck 12 last night

496
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:16,714
I began preparing for everything
like recording "Super Tuna"

497
00:53:16,714 --> 00:53:23,012
I prepared for the hugging event
and other things today

498
00:53:23,012 --> 00:53:24,847
So I'm sure it was lacking

499
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:27,892
and I even forgot how to sing

500
00:53:27,892 --> 00:53:34,690
I was so nervous
so I'm sure tonight was lacking in many ways

501
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:39,904
But despite all that, I'm so thankful

502
00:53:39,904 --> 00:53:43,115
for your unconditional love
and for having a good time tonight

503
00:53:43,115 --> 00:53:47,870
and I'd like to tell you
that I'll always be by your side

504
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:51,666
Thank you so much for enjoying the show

505
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:53,793
and for being here tonight

506
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,683
Though we've been apart for a while

507
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:07,663
you've waited for me so patiently
with such unwavering hearts

508
00:54:07,687 --> 00:54:08,933
and I'm so grateful for that

509
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:15,599
I'll always be orbiting around ARMY

510
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:20,090
and I'll always try to be the light
that shines for you all

511
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:26,868
So, now I'll say goodbye
with one last performance

512
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,454
ARMY, will you keep singing along with me?

513
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:38,250
To all the ARMY here
and to all the ARMY watching online

514
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,797
thank you so much

515
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,304
This has been Jin of BTS

516
00:54:46,304 --> 00:54:47,305
I love you, ARMY!

517
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:20,851
Thank you!

518
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:36,992
Thank you so much
for coming tonight, everyone

519
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:41,330
Thank you

520
00:58:51,465 --> 00:58:53,425
I had so much fun!

521
00:59:00,057 --> 00:59:01,934
I forgot to do my hand kiss
at the beginning!

522
00:59:01,976 --> 00:59:03,644
Aw, man!

523
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:07,273
Thank you so much, everyone

524
00:59:08,524 --> 00:59:11,763
I really had so much fun! Get home safe!

525
00:59:14,071 --> 00:59:15,698
I'll be going now

526
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:20,161
Since I didn't do a hand kiss at the start
I'll finish with one

527
00:59:20,202 --> 00:59:21,245
Camera on me, please

528
00:59:28,878 --> 00:59:30,504
See you, bye!
