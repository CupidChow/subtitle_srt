1
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:41,640
Mom.

2
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,880
I want to ask you.

3
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,119
If you had known from the start

4
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,799
that Dad would leave so soon,

5
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,119
would you still have chosen to be with him?

6
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,159
Of course I would.

7
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:54,679
And,

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,320
I would try my best to treat

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,320
every single time we met

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,079
as if it were the last.

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,159
And cherish it deeply.

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,599
While love is still here,

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,280
cherish it fully.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,319
Do you want to sleep here?

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,439
Boss, you're finally awake!

16
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,359
I'll get the doctor.

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,239
Where is she?

18
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,760
You're awake.

19
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
You slept for a long time.

20
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,000
This time I made a new version of chicken soup.

21
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,959
It's even better than yours.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,959
This is the end I know is coming.

23
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,280
Don't be sad for me.

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm already so grateful.

25
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,280
At the end of my life,

26
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,319
to have met you,

27
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,959
to have had such beautiful times...

28
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm already so happy.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,479
Don't cry.

30
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,560
I hope that when I leave,

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,280
the people who love me are smiling.

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,199
Only then can I rest in peace.

33
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:32,919
Great!

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,039
Perfect!

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,919
And... cut!

36
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,639
Thanks to the efforts

37
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,439
of our actors in every aspect,

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,919
and everyone's persistent

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
cut-after-cutting work...

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,520
I announce

41
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,360
that's a wrap!

42
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,159
Alright!

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,800
Happy wrap day!

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
We've finally wrapped!

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
Let's have a drink tonight. Sure, let's go.

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,039
Going home! Going home!

47
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,840
Come on, let's eat together!

48
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,719
Manager Lu.

49
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,360
You lie down here.

50
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,759
I'll step out.

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,319
Why don't you just say

52
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,319
you want to see Miss Yin directly?

53
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,400
It's not embarrassing.

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,319
I didn't say it's embarrassing.

55
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,479
I just want to see her.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,599
I really do want to see her.

57
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,719
But not today.

58
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,800
She has to attend some award ceremony.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,639
Mixing with those male actors again.

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,840
Look who's here.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,560
Get out, get out.

62
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,840
Oh, oh, oh.

63
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,280
So impatient?

64
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,919
Are you afraid that while you were gone,

65
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,960
I'd fall for some other actor?

66
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,639
Maybe a little afraid.

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,719
You should be.

68
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,639
Because I actually

69
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,759
saw a quite handsome actor recently.

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,479
What was his name...

71
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,240
Uh...

72
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,040
It was...

73
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,519
Liu Yichang.

74
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,639
Him?

75
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,319
I'm not scared of him at all.

76
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,319
He looks like a monkey.

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,519
Not even as good as that... what's his name, Zhou Tong.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,120
Hurry up and get ready.

79
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,759
Don't embarrass me later when you come with me.

80
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,000
Why should I go?

81
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,560
To the award ceremony with me.

82
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,160
Well, alright then.

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,720
Does that mean I can see Li Muchen?

84
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,639
That would be nice.

85
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,040
Pretty good.

86
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,040
Congratulations to Yin Shanshan!

87
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,319
Well done!

88
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,639
Having the opportunity to receive this honor is my privilege.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,920
I want to thank all the crew members here,

90
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,120
thank the director

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,879
for creating such a moving work.

92
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank the behind-the-scenes crew for their full dedication.

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,839
And thank the other actors

94
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,879
for their brilliant performances.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,519
And of course,

96
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,160
I have some personal thanks.

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,720
I want to thank

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,360
those who stay by my side and those who love me.

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,839
Lin Ru.

100
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,839
Xiao Xia.

101
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,120
Jinbai.

102
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,560
Xia Yan.

103
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:43,920
And also

104
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,079
Ms. Yin.

105
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,399
And of course,

106
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,199
the people in this world

107
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,800
with the best taste,

108
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
the best judgment,

109
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,879
and that is

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
my fans.

111
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,279
Actually, there's one more person.

112
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,360
The most important person.

113
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:04,959
It's him.

114
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,279
He's the one who led me out of life's difficulties.

115
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,319
He's the one

116
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,759
who made me recognize my true self.

117
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,120
He once told me, a person's life is long.

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,959
Meeting the wrong person at the wrong time,

119
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,279
that's helplessness.

120
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,879
Meeting the right person at the wrong time,

121
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,279
that's sorrow.

122
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
Meeting at the right time,

123
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
meeting the right person,

124
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
that is happiness.

125
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,759
When my eyes see no other,

126
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,399
and are filled only with you.

127
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,839
I am willing to become the starry sky,

128
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,639
and stay by your side forever.

129
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,120
I believe

130
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,040
I have found happiness.

131
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,639
This person's name

132
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,519
I think everyone knows.

133
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:02,319
Shen Jiaqin! Shen Jiaqin!

134
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,720
He's so tsundere.

135
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
I've said all that,

136
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
and he still won't come up to claim me.

137
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,360
Go on! Okay!

138
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,120
Hello, everyone.

139
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,759
I am Shen Jiaqin.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,439
My wife says I'm tsundere.

141
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,319
Then I'll show you just how tsundere I can be.

142
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,639
Come on, let's raise our glasses together.

143
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,839
To a heartfelt celebration!

144
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,199
And to even greater success!

145
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,160
Cheers!

146
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,040
Everyone, enjoy the meal, take your time.

147
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,959
I'll toast others

148
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,759
Don't drink too much today.

149
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,680
Don't worry.

150
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,439
Those two got pretty close

151
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,600
while I was away.

152
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,839
No development at all.

153
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,439
So,

154
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,160
I transferred Lin Ru to be

155
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
Jinbai's agent.

156
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,319
I thought if they

157
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,879
look after each other every day,

158
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,559
they might make some progress.

159
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,200
You clearly haven't experienced office life.

160
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,399
Who would like someone

161
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,240
who causes them trouble every day?

162
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,200
Then what should we do?

163
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,320
But I've already promised Xiao Xia she can be my agent.

164
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
I swapped it for water. Drink as much as you want.

165
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,200
Isn't our Sister Xia so considerate?

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,480
Quite cunning.

167
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,519
Have a seat.

168
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,440
No, thanks.

169
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
I want to sit over there.

170
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,559
Why do I suddenly feel like

171
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,919
I need to use the restroom?

172
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,840
So when you said you were dating before,

173
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,720
it was Lu Yun?

174
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,519
Mm-hmm.

175
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,559
What's going on with you?

176
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,399
Boss.

177
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,879
Just following your instructions.

178
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,720
Build good relations

179
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,080
with Miss Yin's people. Build good rapport.

180
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,759
Communicate more.

181
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,840
Coordinate better.

182
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,639
Did I teach you to chase after her?

183
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,399
Boss, don't worry.

184
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,519
Her and I,

185
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,840
we both ship you two.

186
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,399
Alright then.

187
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,799
Haven't you two talked about Shanshan in private?

188
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,960
Of course we have.

189
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,440
I'll tell you after dinner.

190
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,440
Lin Ru.

191
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:04,840
Come here.

192
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,639
Xiao Xia is dating.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,799
It's Lu Yun.

194
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,919
Quick, tell her about it.

195
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:18,919
How did you manage it?

196
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,080
Sweet talk, of course.

197
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,480
So it seems men

198
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
only require a set of Child Psychology.

199
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,840
Seize the present moment.

200
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,320
You must be happy.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
But the one who really needs to seize it should be you, right?

202
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,919
What I need to seize is my career and future.

203
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,720
Next project...

204
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,960
I finally don't have to be in the same one as you.

205
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,679
What's wrong?

206
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,639
Filming with your idol,

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,799
aren't you happy?

208
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,080
Idol?

209
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,679
Do you know what an idol is?

210
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,120
You need to maintain a sense of distance.

211
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,039
Distance, understand?

212
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,720
Not necessarily.

213
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,440
What if in your next project,

214
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,559
I just drop in as the female lead?

215
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,480
Don't even think about it.

216
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,120
My role in this project...

217
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,320
the styling is super ugly.

218
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,879
You care so much about looks,

219
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,840
you couldn't handle an ugly look, could you?

220
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
do you know

221
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,159
what 'face of the group' means?

222
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,600
No matter how ugly the styling is,

223
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I can pull it off.

224
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,399
I will absolutely not tell you

225
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,799
what my next project is.

226
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,159
Just kidding.

227
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,120
All the best.

228
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,480
You too.

229
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,720
The tortoise races the rabbit.

230
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,879
The pig is the referee.

231
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,639
Who do you think will win?

232
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,360
The rabbit.

233
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,320
What a fair referee you are.

234
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,799
I'm tired.

235
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,159
I'm so tired.

236
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,840
Rest for a while.

237
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,720
Shanshan.

238
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,679
Shanshan.

239
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,320
Wake up.

240
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,519
Shanshan.

241
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:00,799
Shanshan.

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,720
What are you doing? I was dreaming!

243
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,039
You interrupted me, now I can't reconnect with the dream.

244
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,879
What's the ending of this novel?

245
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,519
What novel? What are you talking about?

246
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,080
The one you wrote, this one right here!

247
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,159
How did what I wrote end up in your hands?

248
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Lin Ru showed us.

249
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,440
Said you're a writing genius.

250
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,519
Said she'll be your agent in the future.

251
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,399
The whole class has passed it around.

252
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,679
Shut up!

253
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,000
Keep shouting and I'll give you a major demerit!

254
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,399
Did Shen Jiaqin really die?

255
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,399
I don't know.

256
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,519
I haven't seen him again either.

257
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,879
You have?

258
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,600
So he really existed?

259
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,799
I wrote about things that happened in my dreams.

260
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,639
Later, even in my dreams,

261
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,519
I never saw him again.

262
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
So what's the actual ending?

263
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,840
I don't know either.

264
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,440
Well, I think

265
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,200
they will definitely meet again in the future.

266
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,960
And live happily together for the rest of their lives.

267
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,480
Mm.

268
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:01,519
Mm.

269
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:02,919
I hope so too.

270
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,799
Shen Jiaqin.

271
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:07,799
Goodbye.

272
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,559
Shanshan.

273
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,480
Come on, let's go check out some handsome guys.

274
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,919
Less than a month into school,

275
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,879
and you're already brawling in a group?

276
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,759
Bullying classmates?

277
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,519
Do you even want to study here?

278
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,000
If not, then get out!

279
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,600
There are two super handsome guys in this year's freshman class.

280
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,919
I don't have parents.

281
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,320
You're talking back?

282
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,960
What's your name?

283
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,559
Shen Zhihe.

284
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,840
Your problem...

285
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I'll talk to you alone after school.

286
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,000
Shanshan.

287
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:39,919
Hey.

288
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,159
I'm Yin Shanshan.

289
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,080
Remember this:

290
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,320
From now on, he's under my protection.

291
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,360
Yin Shanshan, you call your parents in too!

292
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,399
Happy graduation!

293
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,279
Yin Shanshan.

294
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,720
I like you.

295
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,799
I want to do it again.

296
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,080
Shanshan.

297
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,360
The ten years we missed,

298
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,360
this time,

299
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,080
you have to pay it all back to me properly.
