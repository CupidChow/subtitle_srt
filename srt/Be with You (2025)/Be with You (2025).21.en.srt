1
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,960
It's just... you suddenly arranged

2
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,159
such a big production, I'm not used to it

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,759
But these flowers... are really beautiful

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,479
Let me tell you

5
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,399
these flowers...

6
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,399
were specially picked for you by Jinbai

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
Then we should take lots of photos for Jinbai!

8
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
Give the fans some nice content

9
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,560
Just photos?

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,239
Some videos would be good too

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,760
Today is your day, after all!

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,200
The three of us are gathered here just for you

13
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,920
Listen to me, just relax and enjoy it

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,719
Don't worry about us

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,439
Sorry, sorry about that

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,439
Hello?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,480
Lu Yun

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,400
Oh

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
Shen Jiaqin didn't apply his medicine

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,200
Oh my god

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,280
I have to take him back to apply it

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,359
Or it'll be too late

23
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:26,879
Okay, okay, okay

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,760
Shanshan

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,480
What medicine do I need?

26
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,280
I'm so sorry

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,439
I have no choice, it's just...

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,599
Good luck!

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,079
Wait

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,959
Happy Birthday!

31
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,760
I really hope

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,359
my best friend

33
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,879
finds happiness

34
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:50,959
Jealous?

35
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,439
I'm not jealous

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,519
If you're not jealous

37
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,159
why did you rush over here

38
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,640
before your leg injury even healed?

39
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,680
Could it be...

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,040
you're afraid I'll rekindle something with a certain someone?

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,959
I just heard

42
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,759
that a certain someone was photographed on a solo date with a certain someone

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,919
I'm worried it might affect my upcoming projects

44
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,599
Photographed by whom?

45
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,719
The paparazzi

46
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,199
And the paparazzi?

47
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,120
Handled

48
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,520
If it's handled, why are you here?

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,639
Because I know

50
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
that someone introduced her ex-boyfriend

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
to her best friend

52
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,080
How did you know?

53
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,479
I've known for a while

54
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,800
You noticed it too, didn't you?

55
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,319
Lin Ru likes Jinbai

56
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,840
I only realized it when I went back to our high school recently

57
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,120
I saw their dynamic was off

58
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,439
All these years, why...

59
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,639
didn't I notice at all?

60
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,759
Make a wish... for lovers to finally unite

61
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,080
Is it Shen Jiaqin and Yin Shanshan?

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,280
Have you two really gone public?

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,439
Can I take a photo with you both?

64
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,919
Sure

65
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,280
Once again, Happy Birthday to you

66
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,080
Thank you

67
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,719
Thank you

68
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,960
You're the one preparing my birthday gift

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,319
and you're thanking me?

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,639
I'm thanking you for all these years

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
Preparing your birthday

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,560
is the least I could do

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,479
The first couple of years, it was with Shanshan

74
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,199
Later on, I was your staff member

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,000
If I didn't prepare your birthday properly

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,280
would your fans ever let me hear the end of it?

77
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,639
It's not just the birthday parties

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
I mean a lot of things

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,280
I want to thank you for them all

80
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,319
During my most difficult times

81
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,759
I relied on you too

82
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,759
When I was hospitalized, you stayed with me

83
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,759
Every event

84
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,360
every late night on set

85
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,879
you took care of everything meticulously

86
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,639
Xu Jinbai! Xu Jinbai! Xu Jinbai!

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,399
Make way, sorry, make way please!

88
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,600
Xu Jinbai! Xu Jinbai!

89
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,879
He already worked

90
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,199
for eighteen hours straight yesterday!

91
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,560
He only slept three hours today!

92
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,639
Why does he have to wait so long?

93
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,160
There were so many gaps in between!

94
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,240
Because we have too many small, messy scenes

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,920
The transitions took a lot of time

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,959
I'm really sorry, Sister Lin Ru

97
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,560
Our deepest apologies

98
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,319
We've already seriously

99
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,480
exceeded budget and schedule

100
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,759
Please, do us this favor

101
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
I'm your staff member

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
and also your good friend

103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,959
This matter...

104
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,800
It's a small thing

105
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
You know

106
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,720
if it weren't for you

107
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,120
Shanshan and I

108
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,879
probably wouldn't have lasted ten years

109
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,560
What do you think of this one?

110
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,759
Shanshan will definitely like it

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
It couldn't be...

112
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
a birthday surprise from Jinbai, could it?

113
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,879
Isn't this the one you've always liked?

114
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,040
He actually noticed I liked this...

115
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,639
See how thoughtful he is

116
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,959
Jinbai

117
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,600
Shanshan said she loves it

118
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
She can't bear to wear it

119
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,040
Says she has to treasure it

120
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,839
What was I supposed to do?

121
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
I told you your taste is so straight guy

122
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,759
But I think

123
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,439
no matter if something is pretty or not

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,639
it's the thought that counts

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,560
I just hope you two

126
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,879
are happy and joyful together

127
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,759
Birthday gift

128
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,439
Alright

129
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,160
Sorry about that

130
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,120
You still went with the one I picked

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,279
Such a typical straight guy

132
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,160
Don't you like it?

133
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,040
I do

134
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,240
It's pretty

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,839
Let me help you put it on

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,639
Even though it's not something you'd normally pick...

137
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,560
Don't you think I'm too self-absorbed?

138
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,800
Giving someone something you yourself like

139
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,160
is its own kind of romance

140
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,639
In another sense

141
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,160
it's also confidence

142
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,199
Strength

143
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,000
When you focus entirely on yourself

144
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,480
you pay less attention to the people around you

145
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,079
But that's just who you are

146
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,439
The people who like you

147
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,839
like you for your self-absorption

148
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:17,959
Lin Ru

149
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,040
I remember the first time I saw you

150
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,240
you were playing Bach's Arioso

151
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,240
I've played piano since I was a child

152
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,679
The longer I played, the more I understood

153
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,120
I could never become a master

154
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,360
I would never achieve excellence

155
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,519
Until I saw you

156
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,600
Playing a duet with you

157
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,759
was the first time I felt

158
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,679
that a touch on the keys could reach the soul

159
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,080
I truly wished

160
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,919
to become your closest partner

161
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Even if it was just accompanying you

162
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,240
So I applied

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,960
to be the music room monitor

164
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,799
Using waiting as a pretext

165
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,000
to get the chance to sit beside you

166
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,480
Sorry

167
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,559
making you wait so long again

168
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,360
If you keep practicing all night like this

169
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,720
I'll tell the teacher tomorrow

170
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,480
to find someone else to manage the room

171
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,639
Please, I'm begging you

172
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,279
Have mercy on me

173
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,080
Tomorrow, I'll bring you a drink

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Two!

175
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,480
Deal!

176
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,320
You have always been the secret

177
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,360
I kept deepest in my heart

178
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,960
Even my best friend

179
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,360
didn't know

180
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,559
Shanshan always says to me

181
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,919
how lucky she is

182
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,240
that I'm the music room monitor

183
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,919
That way, she can use the excuse of accompanying me

184
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,039
to come see you

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,559
But I never told her

186
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,000
that managing the music room

187
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,200
organizing arts festival rehearsals, taking the art entrance exams...

188
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,559
Every legitimate reason to see you

189
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,279
was backed by my carefully calculated little schemes

190
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:01,960
Let's go

191
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,759
Let's go

192
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,960
But I also hope so much

193
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
that one day

194
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,159
you would see me, among all the people who adore you

195
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,799
Notice me

196
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
Even if there's only a sliver of hope

197
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,759
I want to try, just once

198
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,480
I want to walk hand in hand with you

199
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,759
under the sunlight

200
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,320
Xu Jinbai

201
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,720
I like you

202
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,879
Let's be together

203
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:49,840
Okay

204
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,240
Birthday gift

205
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,399
Don't you like it?

206
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,320
I do, of course I do

207
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,120
Transparent, delicate, warm and flawless

208
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,399
It's so clearly your taste

209
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,080
Then put it on quickly!

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,759
Shouldn't this be kept as a family heirloom?

211
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,720
I'll accept the gift

212
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,200
Okay

213
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,080
I'm finished eating

214
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,480
I have some work to sort out tomorrow

215
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,279
I'll head off first

216
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,480
Let me walk you out

217
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:45,840
No need

218
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,080
Thanks for the flowers

219
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,320
Happy Birthday

220
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,759
I'm off

221
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,919
My final

222
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,840
legitimate reason to see you

223
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,960
is that we both

224
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,000
became the most important people to Shanshan

225
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,960
Ten years

226
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,559
I didn't dare step forward

227
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,600
nor could I step back

228
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,919
I was afraid of breaking this delicate balance

229
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,039
I understand

230
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,360
Shanshan wanted to give me a push forward

231
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,279
But it seems

232
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
with my ability

233
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,600
I can only go this far

234
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,000
In the future

235
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,559
we will still be

236
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,519
the best of friends

237
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,279
Hello, dear

238
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,080
Sorry to bother you

239
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,919
on Valentine's Day

240
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,320
Yes

241
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,679
I wanted to ask about Shanshan's

242
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,200
work schedule for tomorrow

243
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,360
Yes, that's right

244
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:32,559
Thank you

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,480
Thank you both

246
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,679
Wishing you a happy union forever

247
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,320
Bye

248
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,600
Bye, bye

249
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,840
Announcing a relationship

250
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,919
Real or not

251
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,120
feels damn good
