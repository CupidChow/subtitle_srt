1
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:40,679
Don't look.

2
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,920
I've got a sharp eye for these things.

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,159
If he liked me,

4
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,240
why would he reject me?

5
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,000
The dating show finale...

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,119
Everyone ended up in pairs.

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,719
Except for me.

8
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:58,479
Whatever.

9
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,880
I'll just lean into a persona.

10
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:01,880
Cursed

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,000
To Be

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,159
Single

13
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:04,799
How's that?

14
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,079
Then let me, someone truly cursed to be single forever,

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,760
clink glasses with you.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,719
Cheers!

17
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,280
Cheers!

18
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,400
Men are all trash!

19
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,719
Look!

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,640
He perms his hair!

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,840
He wears a ponytail!

22
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,040
Even if you get hit by a car, don't go for someone like that!

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,319
You hear me?

24
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,680
I hear you.

25
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,400
You wear a ponytail too.

26
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,719
So what?

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,360
He's wearing a red sweater

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,680
under his black jacket!

29
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,719
Tell me, who with any fashion sense

30
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,680
would dress like that?!

31
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,479
Right?

32
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,240
But...

33
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm actually relieved.

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,479
I...

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,039
Today, I...

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,280
saw Cao Wen's mom.

37
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,599
I think...

38
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,000
growing up on my own was just fine.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,879
As for us...

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,159
We will both have

41
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,039
the best lives.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,280
Really?

43
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,360
Really.

44
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,520
You get me.

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,560
Come on, cheers!

46
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,080
Come on!

47
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,120
Cheers!

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,479
Cheers!

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,960
Xia Yan, don't let her drink so much.

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
She can't hold her liquor.

51
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,319
Shanshan,

52
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,560
you should stop too.

53
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,800
You two...

54
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,039
from the show to real life...

55
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,400
How about

56
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,159
settling it here and now?

57
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,080
Fight, fight, fight!

58
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
Fight, fight, fight!

59
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,919
Fight, fight, fi...

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,960
Fine.

61
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,319
I'm the third wheel.

62
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,960
I'll disappear.

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,040
Where are you going?

64
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,959
Xia Yan!

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,560
You...

66
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,000
Take good care of her.

67
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,399
Where are you going?

68
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,240
I'm leaving.

69
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,759
Xia Yan!

70
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,720
Stop drinking.

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
What are you doing?

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
Okay, okay, okay, that's enough!

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,720
The bottle's empty.

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,639
Boring.

75
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,199
Let me take you back.

76
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,439
No, no.

77
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,399
I'll take her.

78
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,160
I have something to say to her alone.

79
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll take her back.

80
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,160
You have nothing to say to her.

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,639
Wait for me.

82
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,920
No more drinking.

83
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,639
I'll wait for you outside.

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,040
Shanshan.

85
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,160
I know what you're going to say.

86
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,600
The reason for the breakup, right?

87
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,439
I already know.

88
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,839
I understand.

89
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,439
I respect it.

90
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,519
I accept it.

91
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,839
He got hurt.

92
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,040
Was it serious?

93
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,160
Boss Zhang called him for a private performance,

94
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,279
and he got badly injured.

95
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,920
He also pissed some people off.

96
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,600
People who can decide the fate of his career.

97
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,120
You knew all along?

98
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,759
Why didn't you tell me?

99
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,720
I just didn't want you to bear

100
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,480
the same pressures I did.

101
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,519
You didn't need to.

102
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,040
Protecting you is my duty.

103
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,079
Haven't the past ten years been like this?

104
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,360
Xu Jinbai.

105
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,560
Do you think you love me?

106
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,319
Of course I love you.

107
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,560
Actually, all this time,

108
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,519
I've been waiting for you to tell me the truth.

109
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,199
I never got it.

110
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
You didn't even ask me.

111
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,800
You never asked me

112
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,600
if I had the courage to face the difficulties with you.

113
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
You just decided

114
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,160
I couldn't handle it.

115
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,079
Is that love?

116
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,160
Of course I love you!

117
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,079
It's responsibility

118
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,360
habit

119
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
or guilt.

120
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,480
But none of that is love.

121
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,639
Is it because I've been following you all these years

122
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,600
All these years...

123
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,240
Shanshan

124
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:46,720
Don't touch me!

125
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,639
We've already broken up.

126
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,759
My sweet, soft, comfy bed!

127
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,440
My favorite place, home!

128
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,679
So comfortable~

129
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,840
Say

130
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,120
Yin Shanshan!

131
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,240
Quick, quick, quick!

132
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,360
As this romantic holiday draws to a close,

133
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,399
have you found the one who makes your heart flutter?

134
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,799
Do you have the courage

135
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,600
to make your final love confession?

136
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,799
Our three goddesses now stand before the Doors of Love.

137
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,279
Gentlemen, if you are ready,

138
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,279
please step behind the one who has captured your heart.

139
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,759
You know you can't sing, right?

140
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
But you are very good-looking.

141
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,080
I want...

142
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,799
to try and walk this path with you.

143
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,360
Yin Shanshan caught hitting on her best friend's boyfriend!

144
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,159
Actively hugs rich second-generation heir, enters hotel!

145
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,559
Only to see her

146
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:52,600
Only to see her

147
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,159
throw herself into a man's arms!

148
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,240
Upon closer inspection, it's confirmed

149
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,399
this person is actually Xia Yan's boyfriend!

150
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,200
Suggest Yin Shanshan play a villainess next time,

151
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,960
type-cast, she'd definitely win Best Actress.

152
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
So many personas in the entertainment industry,

153
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,720
but Yin Shanshan's fake innocence is the most disgusting.

154
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,720
Someone should investigate the actors she's worked with before,

155
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,240
probably quite a few victims.

156
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,039
Yin Shanshan! Yin Shanshan!

157
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,039
Is it true or false? Please respond!

158
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,840
Shanshan, please answer us!

159
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,679
Please clarify things for us!

160
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,240
Yes, please give us an answer!

161
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,399
Xu Jinbai.

162
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,799
You traded a ten-year contract with Boss Zhang

163
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,639
for Yin Shanshan's stability.

164
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,039
Is he backing out already?

165
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm the one backing out.

166
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,440
What?

167
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,679
No wonder this incident has such a huge impact.

168
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,200
Turns out you added fuel to the fire.

169
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,480
Why?

170
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,000
That's Yin Shanshan!

171
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,039
She's the one we've always protected!

172
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,240
Even if you broke up,

173
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,440
but ten years ago...

174
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,000
We won't break up.

175
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
She can't leave me.

176
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,320
She simply can't manage without me.

177
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,240
I just want her to know

178
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,159
how dark this industry truly is.

179
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,879
If even one hand tries to hold her down,

180
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,559
she has no way to break free.

181
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,399
Actually, you and I both know

182
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,559
the reason she's had such a smooth career all these years

183
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,600
is because you and I have been paving the way for her.

184
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,240
If I told you this today,

185
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,200
I bet you wouldn't dare tell her.

186
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,799
You clearly love her.

187
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,279
Why must you...

188
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,559
My goal in doing this

189
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,480
is solely to make her grow up.

190
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,960
After going through all this,

191
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,000
she will understand

192
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,039
that I did it for her own good.

193
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
She can't leave me.

194
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,480
You still don't understand her well enough.

195
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Even if she leaves this industry,

196
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,960
she won't compromise because of such threats.

197
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,720
That's because I was the one compromising for her all along!

198
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,759
What if I weren't here?

199
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,440
If no one was here to compromise for her?

200
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,559
So what do you plan to do?

201
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,919
Tomorrow is the scheduled press conference, right?

202
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,399
I'll start a live stream.

203
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll tell everyone

204
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,480
that Shanshan and I have been together since our student days.

205
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,519
I originally planned to propose and go public

206
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
on the variety show.

207
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,840
But some people just don't know their place.

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
They knew perfectly well Shanshan was in a relationship,

209
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
yet they pursued her relentlessly.

210
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,399
Of course,

211
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,919
I'll tell everyone

212
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,080
that Shanshan just temporarily lost her way.

213
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,360
It wasn't intentional.

214
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,799
I will forgive her.

215
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,679
Aren't you outright accusing her of cheating?

216
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,840
She never did that!

217
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,080
The truth of the process doesn't matter.

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,720
Only the outcome matters.

219
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,360
This will ruin her acting career!

220
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,759
All these years,

221
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
wasn't it me

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,200
who step by step brought her to where she is?

223
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,879
Ruin it?

224
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,159
I can build it up again for her!

225
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,200
Xu Jinbai,

226
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
why have you become like this?

227
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:12,799
A ru.

228
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,240
I don't trust anyone else by her side.

229
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,480
Except for you.

230
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,840
You are her very best friend.

231
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,320
My purpose in doing this is completely

232
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,480
to protect her.

233
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,399
Another scandal broke.

234
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,600
Let's find a place to discuss solutions.

235
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,360
I booked a meeting room at the hotel.

236
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,080
Third floor, 2 PM.

237
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,759
Let's talk there.

238
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,840
Hotel, third-floor meeting room.

239
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,679
2 PM.

240
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,440
Hotel meeting room.

241
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,240
2 PM.

242
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,519
Boss, sorry,

243
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,360
but a new group of guests

244
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,399
just checked in.

245
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,519
We didn't know until they arrived, they're all reporters.

246
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,240
You know we can't exactly refuse guests, right?

247
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,720
Change it to the cafe.

248
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,480
Okay?

249
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,919
No.

250
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,480
That place is in a busy area.

251
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,320
If you're photographed,

252
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,399
people will think you're on a date.

253
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's make a group chat.

254
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,759
We'll switch to the usual spot.

255
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,600
I've sent you the address.

256
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,799
The negative public opinion is out of control now.

257
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,919
Coming for You

258
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,840
rejected you.

259
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,879
But the contract was already signed!

260
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,000
Now all actor contracts

261
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,480
require a Public Opinion Guarantee clause.

262
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,000
Yours counts as negative.

263
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,000
They can terminate directly and demand compensation.

264
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,000
Fortunately, Director Chen still likes you somewhat.

265
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,399
He didn't mention compensation.

266
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,200
But Boss Zhang's side

267
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,519
has already sent a lawyer's letter.

268
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,559
Demanding termination.

269
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,000
And demanding sky-high penalty fees.

270
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,679
The money from your studio plus your personal accounts...

271
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,039
we're still short by seven figures.

272
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,639
So much?

273
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,759
Your contract with the company was unfair to begin with.

274
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,639
The company takes the lion's share of the pay.

275
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,440
And you have to pay for your own promotion.

276
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,279
After several PR crises,

277
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,320
the finances are severely strained.

278
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,399
That baldy Zhang...

279
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,039
Can't we sit down and talk it out?

280
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,720
Last time there was a big fuss too,

281
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,440
didn't it blow over?

282
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,679
Last time, Jinbai smoothed it over for you

283
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,639
by agreeing to renew his own contract.

284
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,960
This time...

285
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,919
This time, I want to rely on myself.

286
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,240
I'm sorry.

287
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,000
I've dragged you all down.

288
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,840
Actually, it's our problem.

289
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,039
You...

290
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,039
We've already investigated.

291
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,039
The paparazzo who broke the story

292
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,120
works for a rival of our H Hotel group.

293
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,240
Miss Yin,

294
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,080
is our designated spokesperson and the film's female lead.

295
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,360
That's why she got caught up in this.

296
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,720
However, the paparazzo issue

297
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,840
has been resolved.

298
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,480
He will release a statement later,

299
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,600
saying all previous reports

300
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,720
were fabricated.

301
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,559
As for the variety show side,

302
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,720
it's because their producer

303
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,600
took a bribe.

304
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,159
That's why they maliciously edited the finale

305
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,919
and deleted a lot of the original footage.

306
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,600
We've already clarified this matter.

307
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,200
We're just wrapping things up now.

308
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,879
Moreover, we will also

309
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,799
re-screen all the staff

310
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,679
working on the film set.

311
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,919
We'll make each of them

312
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,039
sign a commitment letter,

313
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,559
guaranteeing that similar incidents

314
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,600
will absolutely not happen again.

315
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,679
But the damage is already done!

316
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,240
Once you're replaced and contracts are terminated,

317
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,000
people

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,720
won't believe these

319
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,799
paid-off explanations.

320
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,600
This affects Yin Shanshan's reputation!

321
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,480
The reputation she's built up over so many years!

322
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,000
Now she's a scandal-plagued celebrity.

323
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,679
Do you know how important

324
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,120
reputation is for an actor?

325
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,919
This could ruin her career for life!

326
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,639
I understand.

327
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,720
So, all your losses

328
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,559
will be covered by us.

329
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,440
Also, regarding the Coming for You

330
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
production team issue,

331
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,840
I will also find a way to resolve it.

332
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,200
It won't affect her future work.

333
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,639
Confirming the affair between you and Yin Shanshan?

334
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,559
Her sleeping her way into the role?

335
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,320
Shoot this film,

336
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,799
then immediately retire from the industry? Is that it?

337
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,599
What if we have Jinbai and Xia Yan

338
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,119
issue statements to clarify?

339
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
Xu Jinbai won't agree.

340
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,559
Why?

341
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,440
Boss Zhang won't let him get involved.

342
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,200
Otherwise, he'll be shelved too.

343
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,680
But...

344
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
He could just tell the truth!

345
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,400
The show wasn't

346
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,559
anything like how it was broadcast!

347
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,240
Is there any truth in this industry?

348
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,039
Or publicly announce your relationship with Xu Jinbai.

349
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,279
I think your

350
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,599
couple fans are pretty loyal too.

351
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,039
Maybe Boss Zhang will see the value in a celebrity couple.

352
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,599
He might think...

353
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,400
Impossible.

354
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,200
I've already broken up with him.

355
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,440
I can't give him

356
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,759
this kind of false hope.

357
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,200
What about a contract couple, then?

358
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,680
Not even if time flowed backwards.

359
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,759
Time...

360
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:55,559
flowed backwards?

361
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,960
No

362
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,400
No
