1
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,240
Joining a dating show?

2
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,759
No, no, no.

3
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,280
Absolutely not.

4
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:45,799
Publicly dating?

5
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,920
It clashes way too much with your

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,759
Nation's Little Sister image.

7
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:48,880
So what?

8
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,000
The Nation's Little Sister has to grow up someday,

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,679
and fall in love someday, right?

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,359
And this way, the whole nation can witness it.

11
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,799
Have you even watched a dating show before?

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,880
Isn't it just a reality show?

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,840
The way dating shows go viral isn't just

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,359
about being sweet and romantic.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,840
Elite returnee, rich beauty...

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,760
How many viewers nowadays

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,280
buy into that superior persona?

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,040
And the innocent, naive sweetheart...

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,359
Do female viewers even like that type?

20
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,560
The audience for dating shows is mostly women!

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,400
For heaven's sake, use your brains!

22
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,480
Sorry, Sister Yan.

23
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,120
Little Yanyan,

24
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,359
don't be so serious.

25
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,799
Just be your usual charming self.

26
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,959
You're so captivating,

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,159
what male guest wouldn't be drawn to you?

28
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,239
But am I going there to attract men?

29
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,280
I'm going for the buzz, to go viral!

30
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,200
Don't you know that?

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,120
Eating eight cakes a day...

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,920
De-stressing by eatingLuosifen (River Snail Rice Noodles)...

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,959
This big eater foodie persona

34
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,159
is so outdated, isn't it?

35
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,560
But,

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,560
eating Luosifen...

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,719
we can keep that.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,840
That's it?

39
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,120
Tomorrow,

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,280
each of you gives me five proposal drafts.

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,240
Understood?

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,319
Five?!

43
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,759
Why are you still standing there? Get to work!

44
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,960
On the sixth day, he gave her flowers again.

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,719
He brings flowers every time they meet!

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,240
This guy is so smooth!

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,919
Don't get carried away.

48
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,719
It's all scripted.

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
So did they end up together?

50
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,120
Hmm?

51
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,560
See, this

52
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,919
is way better than those artificial idol dramas.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,680
This dating show...

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm definitely joining.

55
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,439
Sis,

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,800
I showed you this

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,919
so you'd know these shows have fabricated personas.

58
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,439
Your Nation's Little Sister image

59
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,919
isn't popular in this kind of show.

60
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,560
It's not for you.

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,240
Then I'll break that image.

62
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll let everyone see

63
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,719
a fresher,

64
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
more real Yin Shanshan.

65
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,599
From an innocent sweetheart

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,520
to

67
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,439
a blunt sweetheart.

68
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,319
How about that?

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes, Director Chen, don't worry.

70
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,080
Our funding will definitely arrive on time.

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,599
I won't be joining the variety show.

72
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,759
I'm not really

73
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,080
the type to appear publicly.

74
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,439
Thank you for your hard work.

75
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,599
So painstakingly devoted.

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,039
A man working hard behind the scenes.

77
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,240
When will this hopeless, secret affection

78
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,319
finally see the light of day?

79
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Did I step on your vocal cords?

80
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,919
During the days I was in a coma,

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,199
the hotel's net income dropped by six percent.

82
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,439
Boss, I've been trying my best.

83
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,280
Shen Zhihe took advantage of your coma

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,080
to relentlessly attack our hotel.

85
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,479
He's not just stealing our clientele,

86
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,000
he's also trying to snatch the investment for Coming for You.

87
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,360
I used every trick in the book

88
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,680
to stop him from succeeding.

89
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,439
He wants to invest in this project?

90
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,680
I heard the day after you fell into a coma,

91
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,319
he went to see the film producer.

92
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,800
Even the idea to promote the dating show early

93
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,000
to generate hype

94
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,080
was his.

95
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,800
He suggested the candidates too.

96
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,879
Give me the guest list.

97
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,079
I've already handled it.

98
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,720
He didn't succee...

99
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,360
Wasn't this your recommendation? Right?

100
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,439
I know, Yin Shanshan.

101
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
B-But Xu Jinbai

102
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,480
was Director Chen's preferred male lead all along.

103
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
That's normal.

104
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,959
Dating You, Coming for You!

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,839
Let us begin the most heart-fluttering

106
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,199
exclusive romantic journey!

107
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,600
We've invited several guests you all know,

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
or often hear about,

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,199
but have never seen before

110
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,000
to join us on this dating journey.

111
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,720
We hope that by observing their journey to love,

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,000
you can all feel the beauty of romance.

113
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:41,959
Besides me,

114
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,920
the panel has two other mystery guests

115
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,160
who will join you all

116
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,839
in watching the guests' interactions in real-time.

117
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,959
Cao Wen.

118
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,560
You know her?

119
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
She's good friends with my sister.

120
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,079
That reaction...

121
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
Something's up.

122
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,959
Hello everyone, I'm Cao Wen.

123
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,639
Um,

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,560
Haoran

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,439
just came back from Manchester.

126
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,279
My Chinese isn't great.

127
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,279
Do you remember me?

128
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
Doesn't seem familiar.

129
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,319
Aren't you...

130
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,480
I'm Angela's brother.

131
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,079
We... we've met before.

132
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,720
Sister, please sit here.

133
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,199
Have a seat.

134
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,439
I've seen your performances before.

135
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,279
Very cool.

136
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,800
Let me introduce myself first.

137
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,399
My name is Xia Yan.

138
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,920
My biggest hobby

139
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,720
is...

140
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,279
following others around and joining in their fun.

141
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,480
Her introduction is so awkward!

142
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,639
I can already feel

143
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,560
the cringe of an introvert pretending to be outgoing.

144
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,879
Sis, have an orange.

145
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,319
Thanks.

146
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,319
Who will the new guest be?

147
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,879
Shen Jiaqin?

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,120
Hello, hello.

149
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,040
Please, sit.

150
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,480
Jiaqin,

151
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,480
why are you here too?

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,199
Are you feeling awkward

153
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,800
because there are so many people here?

154
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm the same, when there's a crowd,

155
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,120
I never know what to say.

156
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,879
But luckily I know you.

157
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:24,519
Xia Yan

158
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,560
is actually a

159
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,759
tongue-tied little cutie in private?

160
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,360
The way she latches onto someone she knows...

161
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,319
is exactly like me!

162
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,360
Yin Shanshan's mouth is so sharp!

163
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,560
Is there anything she doesn't criticize?

164
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,600
I actually used to like her?

165
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,360
I must have been blind.

166
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,040
Alright, alright,

167
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,800
stop reading.

168
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,040
You can't stand it either, huh?

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,759
I say, sis,

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,160
could you please

171
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,959
use your brain a little when you speak?

172
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,240
Didn't they invite me to the panel

173
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,800
precisely to give commentary?

174
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Why else would they want me here?

175
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,920
But they only want you

176
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,519
to say what they want to hear,

177
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,360
not your real thoughts.

178
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,399
Then how is that any different

179
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,439
from acting from a script?

180
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,279
This is a reality show!

181
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,480
You got that right.

182
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,720
It's acting.

183
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
Didn't I give you the show's

184
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,839
planned couple pairings and setups?

185
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,639
Just hype them up in that direction!

186
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,480
Even though dating shows are all acted,

187
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,079
they don't have to be that fake.

188
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,639
Sis Shanshan, calm down.

189
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,319
Maybe

190
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,759
you could just be like Xu Jinbai,

191
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,519
and not say a word.

192
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,959
Xu Jinbai is here.

193
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,679
He's the other mystery guest?

194
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,200
Shanshan,

195
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,559
every word you say will be analyzed by everyone.

196
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,960
I never should have agreed to let you come.

197
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,480
So Xu Jinbai is here...

198
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,480
You knew?

199
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,519
Yes, I knew.

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,039
And he wants to star in this film,

201
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,960
so it's normal for him to be a guest, right?

202
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,840
And that Xia Yan is a guest too!

203
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,480
He just thought the main house was more impactful,

204
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,360
so he went there instead.

205
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,240
Look at her trending searches,

206
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,759
her numbers are skyrocketing every day.

207
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,320
Can't you learn from her?

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,799
Alright, alright,

209
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,720
stop changing the subject.

210
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,639
So,

211
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,799
just now,

212
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,720
the person in the observation room next to me was Xu Jinbai?

213
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,919
And now, the person in the room next to me

214
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,879
is also Xu Jinbai?

215
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,919
Yes.

216
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,759
I'm going to find him.

217
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,679
Yin Shanshan!

218
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,840
You keep saying you want to star in this film,

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,960
that you want to fight for yourself this time.

220
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,919
But the moment Xu Jinbai shows up,

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,039
you'll just ditch the post-show interviews?

222
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,720
I won't neglect my work.

223
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,919
I just need to know

224
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,240
why he disappeared back then.

225
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,399
Why he suddenly broke up with me.

226
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,120
I just want to know why.

227
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:40,840
Fine.

228
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,879
You'll have plenty of time to find out later.

229
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,519
The production team just messaged me.

230
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
They said the panel's feedback isn't as good as the main house's.

231
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,080
So they want you and Xu Jinbai

232
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,440
to join the main house together.

233
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,960
What would I do there?

234
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,799
Date him?

235
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,000
Or watch him date someone else?

236
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,480
Anyway, Xu Jinbai has already agreed.

237
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,240
I'm not going.

238
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,480
Fine.

239
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,440
Don't go.

240
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,519
Then we'll quit the show.

241
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,720
Great, saves me the trouble.

242
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,480
From now on,

243
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,799
let's just stick to filming idol dramas.

244
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,480
Um,

245
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,480
has the production team

246
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,639
given me any

247
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,600
specific couple storyline?

248
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,600
Not at the moment.

249
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,279
But no matter who you pair up with,

250
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,720
as long as your couple gets the highest popularity,

251
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,039
the female lead role in this movie

252
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,399
is definitely yours.

253
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,000
Then I need to come up with a

254
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,399
fresh,

255
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,039
unique persona.

256
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,759
How did I come up with this

257
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,759
truant who climbs walls persona?

258
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,279
The last time I climbed a wall was...

259
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,440
Get down. You're heavy.

260
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,120
What are you doing here?

261
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,679
If you haven't done a move in years,

262
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,120
don't try it again.

263
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,360
How did you know?

264
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,159
Sis Shanshan,

265
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,399
you...

266
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,960
I get it.

267
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,480
You're a guest on this show too, aren't you?

268
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,000
This is great!

269
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,360
Another familiar face is here.

270
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,000
You two knew each other before too, right?

271
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,519
You two...

272
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,720
Is it true?

273
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,960
True what?

274
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,759
Of course not!

275
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,279
Don't imagine things, Sis Shanshan.

276
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Right, Jiaqin?

277
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,759
Welcome back to school, everyone!

278
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,600
Our new guest, Yin Shanshan,

279
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
has now joined us.

280
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,120
But there's still one more mystery guest

281
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,039
waiting outside the door.

282
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,039
The auntie selling Chinese Pancake at the school gate is still there.

283
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,960
The usual: two eggs, one sausage.

284
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,039
Eat it while it's hot.

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,279
I didn't expect

286
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,159
Shanshan and Xu Jinbai to know each other from school.

287
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,960
Shanshan and I were high school classmates.

288
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,200
Oh, not only you're her high school classmate.

289
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,879
And I'm not?

290
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,000
Besides, the best food at the school gate

291
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
was takoyaki,

292
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,360
not this thing!

293
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,279
Sorry, sir

294
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
I don't really remember you.

295
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,120
And you are?

296
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,480
No need to remember me.

297
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,000
Just remember the girls.

298
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,480
Why would you remember me?

299
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,919
Shanshan and I took art school entrance exams together in high school.

300
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,480
We even debuted in the same film.

301
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,039
Although we haven't been in touch for years,

302
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,840
Shanshan was indeed

303
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
a very important person

304
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,159
to me in my student days.

305
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,399
So important.

306
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,200
What did you eat for breakfast?

307
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,399
Your voice is so deep.

308
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,879
Each of you has

309
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,399
one date invitation card.

310
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,240
You can invite your crush.

311
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,360
Of course, they have the right to refuse.

312
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,879
You can also choose to save your invitation cards.

313
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,840
If you save more than two cards,

314
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
you can unlock

315
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,759
an irresistible heart-fluttering date!
