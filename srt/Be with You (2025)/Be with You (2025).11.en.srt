1
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,679
The way Shen Jiaqin is now...

2
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,920
it really reminds me of that little punk

3
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,240
from his student days.

4
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,600
Team Leader Shen was one of our first volunteers,

5
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,119
and he's stuck with it the longest.

6
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,040
He basically makes time every week

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,239
to come care for the patients.

8
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,680
Terminal patients don't actually need much.

9
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,799
Sometimes, just talking with them

10
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,280
makes them really happy.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,719
Xiao Wu!

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,640
I need to get back to work.

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,640
Feel free to look around.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,599
Coming!

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,359
Shen Jiaqin!

16
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,920
Shen Jiaqin, can't you see me?

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
I've called your name several times!

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,439
Are you blind?

19
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,120
I'm busy.

20
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:27,920
No, no, wait!

21
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,719
I really need to ask you something.

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,439
After our car accident,

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,879
I went through this...

24
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,760
incredibly surreal experience.

25
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,680
I went back to the past.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,239
I time-traveled into

27
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,840
another version of myself in a different time.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,680
I...

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,159
After I fell into a coma, I opened my eyes,

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,359
and I was a high school student.

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,159
You don't have to scare me like that.

32
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,879
The group will cover

33
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,920
all your expenses.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,640
No, no, that's not it!

35
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,319
I'm not trying to extort you!

36
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,480
Everything I'm saying is true!

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,599
I went back to the past.

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,400
I went back to my high school years.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,799
And then I met you.

40
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,959
You said we knew each other,

41
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,560
and that we were

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,200
best friends.

43
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,319
That's completely different from my memories.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,439
And then... then... then you...

45
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,000
Then you used this watch...

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,319
and sent me back to the present.

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,080
So all the strange things that happened to me before...

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,039
were because of this watch?

49
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,240
This watch...

50
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,000
is the only keepsake my mother left me.

51
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,520
It might not be worth much,

52
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,520
but don't get any ideas about it.

53
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,479
You really don't know anything?

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,159
You really don't remember at all?

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,159
Worst case scenario...

56
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,400
I'll just go back to the past.

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,000
Are you done playing around?

58
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,319
That's enough.

59
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,680
This is a hospice ward.

60
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
It's the last place they can find comfort.

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,360
Someone with a princess complex doesn't belong here.

62
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,080
Why don't I belong here?

63
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,319
I came here to be a volunteer!

64
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,319
Let me tell you,

65
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,599
I have a lot of life experience.

66
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,639
I might understand what they need

67
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,439
better than you do!

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,039
Based on your acting experience?

69
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,840
So what?

70
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,439
Don't look down on my acting experience!

71
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,360
I'll have you know,

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,879
if I were preparing a surprise for them,

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,199
I would never

74
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,840
put on a mascot costume and jump around

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,439
in front of children

76
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,439
who are going blind!

77
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,439
What would you do then?

78
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,159
Don't they want to go to an amusement park?

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,520
Then take them to a real one!

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,960
Do you know how difficult it is

81
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,000
for them to leave this ward?

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,479
What brilliant idea do you have?

83
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,000
Dream on.

84
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:45,960
I...

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,879
I'll definitely think of a way!

86
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,479
What are you doing?

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,840
Don't talk.

88
00:03:59,319 --> 00:03:59,960
Just feel.

89
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,960
Keke's blindness isn't total darkness.

90
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,120
It's because the tumor is pressing on her optic nerve,

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,280
causing her vision to deteriorate rapidly.

92
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,919
But actually,

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,360
the world in front of her

94
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,960
isn't pitch black.

95
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,879
She can still perceive light,

96
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
perceive colors,

97
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,160
and sense the movement of people and things around her.

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,879
Just like you are now,

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
with this gauze over your eyes, seeing the world.

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,040
Open your eyes.

101
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,560
Now, we've arrived in the forest.

102
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,680
So, using these blurry lights and shadows,

103
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,560
combined with sensory perception

104
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,800
and verbal guidance,

105
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,199
we can make her

106
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,439
imagine corresponding scenes.

107
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,839
You want to use this method

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,439
to make Keke believe she's really at the amusement park?

109
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,839
Exactly.

110
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,879
You scared me to death!

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,959
Yin Shanshan!

112
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,319
Why aren't you resting in your room?

113
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,959
What are you doing?

114
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,720
If the paparazzi take pictures again

115
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,000
and make up weird stories, what then?

116
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:30,839
I...

117
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,120
I... I'm at the hospital!

118
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,199
I'm not wandering around!

119
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,639
Then what's this?

120
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,759
I knew it was you at a glance!

121
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,199
Who are you hugging?

122
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:45,800
I...

123
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,120
I'm volunteering!

124
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,759
Volunteering requires hugging?

125
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,680
Look clearly!

126
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,800
I was just covering his eyes!

127
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,319
Cut the nonsense! Tell me, who is he?

128
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,439
What if he goes to the paparazzi?

129
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,000
Photos like this, out of context, are easily misunderstood.

130
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,879
Shen Jiaqin.

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,519
Boss.

132
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,879
You and Yin Shanshan were hugging!

133
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,560
What's going on?

134
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,439
Why didn't you tell me?

135
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,360
What photo?

136
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:27,600
No,

137
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,560
we weren't hugging.

138
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:29,920
Liar.

139
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,319
Still lying!

140
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,319
I recognized you two immediately.

141
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,360
Come on,

142
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,240
confess!

143
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,279
Where did this photo come from?

144
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,480
Why are you suddenly doing charity work,

145
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,040
learning about terminal patients?

146
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,279
The female lead in Coming for You

147
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,480
has a terminal illness.

148
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,000
I just want to understand

149
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,439
what Director Chen meant by

150
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,879
the soul of the performance.

151
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
What it really is.

152
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,800
You're suddenly so invested in this project...

153
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,959
Did you hear those rumors?

154
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,079
What rumors?

155
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,920
Nothing, nothing.

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,639
What rumors?

157
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,560
Xu Jinbai is back.

158
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,319
Rumor has it he agreed to star in this film.

159
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh.

160
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
Jinbai is back?

161
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,480
But what does his return have to do with me?

162
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
I broke up with him ages ago.

163
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:30,839
Really?

164
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,839
You're not being so enthusiastic because of him?

165
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,639
Of course it has nothing to do with him!

166
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
This time, my effort

167
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
is for myself.

168
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,480
I don't want to rely on fans,

169
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,439
or on popularity.

170
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,800
I just want to rely on my own understanding of the script

171
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,120
and my research into the role,

172
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,360
using my own acting skills to earn it.

173
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,120
If you really mean that,

174
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,879
then I support you.

175
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,319
It's getting late.

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,319
I have rehearsals tomorrow.

177
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,000
Wait,

178
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,639
I promised to stay here overnight.

179
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,120
Otherwise, your mom will scold me again.

180
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm perfectly healthy.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,120
I don't need you to stay.

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,240
If you don't tell and I don't tell,

183
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,360
how would my mom know?

184
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,879
You really went to Boss Zhang for Shanshan?

185
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,840
It's what I should have done.

186
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,080
I failed her.

187
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,480
Boss Zhang will never let Shanshan off the hook.

188
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,639
Why bother?

189
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,879
But he already agreed.

190
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,320
Agreed?

191
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
The company will stop all the attacks

192
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,399
from the marketing accounts against Shanshan.

193
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,919
If she gets any new work opportunities in the future,

194
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,840
the company won't maliciously obstruct her anymore.

195
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,279
How is that possible?

196
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,120
Boss Zhang is so profit-driven.

197
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,200
Did you make a deal with Boss Zhang?

198
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,320
How could I?

199
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,440
You're overthinking it.

200
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,960
Please take good care of Shanshan for me.

201
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,679
Did you renewed your contract?

202
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,639
But that Zhang Daqian

203
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,000
only uses you to make money.

204
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,159
Making you do things you don't want to do.

205
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Wasn't this injury proof enough?

206
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,919
He doesn't care about your health at all.

207
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,039
The ten-year contract is about to expire.

208
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,200
And you're talking about renewing it now?

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,320
Alright, alright, A-Ru.

210
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,440
Coming for You

211
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,320
is a project I've already accepted.

212
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,519
But the female lead isn't confirmed yet.

213
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,720
The production team, to build hype early,

214
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,360
specially created a variety show.

215
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,440
They call it a dating show,

216
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,039
but it's really for casting.

217
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,120
The producer talked to me.

218
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,919
I've already agreed to participate.

219
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,679
Keep an eye out for Shanshan too.

220
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,759
You're always making decisions for Shanshan.

221
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,559
Does this kind of so-called sacrifice

222
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,919
really mean anything?

223
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,480
I know her too well.

224
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,759
She has no idea

225
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,399
how dangerous this world can be.

226
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,720
But one day she will grow up.

227
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,120
She will find out eventually.

228
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,120
Then let her never grow up.

229
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,600
Let her never know.

230
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,639
Let her live in this beautiful world forever.

231
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,679
Keke, we're about to go out now!

232
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,279
Can you feel the warm sunshine?

233
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,879
It's so warm!

234
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,159
Sister,

235
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,240
the wind smells like flowers.

236
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,759
There are lots of flowers in the yard.

237
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,519
Sister will take you to smell them now.

238
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I want a flower.

239
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:01,960
A flower?

240
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,159
Flower.

241
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,039
We can't just pick flowers from the yard.

242
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,320
So...

243
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,240
So...

244
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,240
So, so, so...

245
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,639
Sister bought a bouquet for you!

246
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,519
Thank you, sister.

247
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,480
We're here.

248
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,200
Big brother will carry you to the car.

249
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,039
Keke,

250
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
our amusement park journey

251
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:49,960
is about to begin!

252
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,080
We're going to the amusement park! I'm so happy!

253
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
To the amusement park!

254
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
Now we can watch the acrobatics show!

255
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,960
I want to ride the merry-go-round!

256
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,440
Here comes the merry-go-round!

257
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,480
Where's the lady with curly hair?

258
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,360
Keke,

259
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,200
what lady with curly hair?

260
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,559
The lady with curly hair who watches the merry-go-round.

261
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,159
Mom said

262
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,399
the curly-haired lady checks the height

263
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,879
before I can ride the horse.

264
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,240
I thank you on Keke's behalf.

265
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,679
I thank you for her too.

266
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,919
Thank you.

267
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,600
Do I look good?

268
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,960
Very pretty.

269
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,360
Next time, I hope it's short hair.

270
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,039
The horse went round and round so many times.

271
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,279
There was laughter all around.

272
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,759
Mom,

273
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,240
you're crying.

274
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,200
No, I'm not.

275
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Is it because I didn't take you with me?

276
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,240
Are you unhappy?

277
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,039
No.

278
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,720
Mom is happy

279
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,919
because I see you having fun.

280
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,120
When I grow up,

281
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,480
I'll definitely take you with me too.

282
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,600
Okay, okay. Then you must take your medicine

283
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,200
and listen to your big brother and sister.

284
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,600
Director Chen?

285
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,679
I didn't expect to meet you here.

286
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,240
I just wanted to experience it for myself.

287
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,720
Director Chen, why are you here?

288
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,320
A friend of mine

289
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,679
knew I needed material,

290
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,120
so he specifically

291
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,600
asked me to come witness this scene.

292
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm lucky to see their

293
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,559
joyful expressions after

294
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,440
their dream came true.

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,480
What is it?

296
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,960
You're different from what I imagined.

297
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,120
I remember telling you

298
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,519
you weren't my ideal Lu Jin.

299
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,679
Actually, personality-wise,

300
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,639
you're quite similar to Lu Jin.

301
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,600
Sunny, bright,

302
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,120
and fearless.

303
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:37,960
But,

304
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,240
you're clearly the kind of girl

305
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,639
who's been well-protected.

306
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,960
You haven't experienced pain or failure.

307
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,879
But Lu Jin is different.

308
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,679
She's a girl who remains sunny

309
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,159
even after experiencing pain and failure.

310
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,240
In terms of life experience,

311
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,559
I think Xia Yan is more suitable for the role of Lu Jin.

312
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,639
The reason I'm telling you all this today is that

313
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,639
I see something in you now

314
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,080
that I hadn't noticed before.

315
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,360
For example, your empathy,

316
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,120
your perceptiveness.

317
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,360
Most importantly, you know what it is?

318
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,279
You dare to change.

319
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,559
So Director Chen, does that mean

320
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,120
you'll still consider me

321
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,879
for the female lead in Coming for You?

322
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,879
I'm afraid not.

323
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,519
But I can invite you to participate in

324
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,000
the Coming for You variety show.

325
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,600
Yes!

326
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,279
Of course!

327
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,720
Thank you, Director Chen!

328
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,879
A dating show?
