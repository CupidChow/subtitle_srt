1
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,200
Shen Jiaqin

2
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:43,840
I like you.

3
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,439
I love you.

4
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,119
I did save your life,

5
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,320
but at the same time,

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,039
I almost ruined it.

7
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,480
Tell me,

8
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,519
did you secretly

9
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,719
do a lot of things for me before?

10
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,879
My current temperament,

11
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,120
it must be because of you.

12
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,079
Right.

13
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,319
Because I love you,

14
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,439
so I spoil you.

15
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,959
What have you done with this watch?

16
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,560
Tell me.

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,640
I've done a lot of things.

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,879
A whole lot.

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,280
So I was such a terrible person?

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,200
I always thought

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
I was some kind of chosen one,

22
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,040
could recklessly shake up the entertainment industry.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,959
Shouldn't Lin Ru have given you

24
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,120
a huge red envelope?

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,040
You're way better

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,079
than those PR teams she hired.

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,760
I should be the one giving her a big red envelope.

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,280
I said she should give you one.

29
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,359
What she did was much more

30
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,159
than what I did.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,760
I

32
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,840
just needed to find a way to tell her things.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
She was the one who solved the problems.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,159
How did you get her to believe you?

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,240
She might not believe,

36
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,039
but she would mitigate risks for you.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
What's wrong?

38
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,400
Don't be upset.

39
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,199
We just helped handle some things

40
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,560
that could have harmed you.

41
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,039
Think about it.

42
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,240
So many people like you,

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,199
it must be because of you.

44
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,520
Because I'm adorable,

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,400
and exceptionally beautiful.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,159
I know.

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm just touched.

48
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,919
The people around me

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,240
all love me so fiercely.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,719
Especially you.

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,800
From now on,

52
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,520
don't use this anymore.

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,800
Now that I have you by my side,

54
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,919
no matter what happens,

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,919
I can face it.

56
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,919
Let me keep it for you.

57
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,240
It's broken anyway.

58
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,039
Can't use it even if I wanted to.

59
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,879
Then I'll leave it with you.

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,960
Reversing time...

61
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,960
sounds like it comes with a great cost.

62
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,240
No more from now on.

63
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,000
Auntie.

64
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,400
Don't worry.

65
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,439
I'll take care of him from now on.

66
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,840
Shen Zhihe.

67
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,080
Why is he calling me?

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,360
Answer it.

69
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,080
He's probably come to his senses,

70
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,520
wants to make peace with you.

71
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,759
Don't leave my sight.

72
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,439
Speak.

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,159
You're with her again?

74
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,680
Stay away from her.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,840
Or I won't say anything.

76
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,639
If you have nothing to say, I'm hanging up.

77
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,680
It's a threat to your sweetheart's life.

78
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,720
Don't listen if you don't want to.

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't leave my sight.

80
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,639
Don't worry.

81
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,439
Go on.

82
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,759
Help! Help!

83
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,120
Help!

84
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,759
Save me! Help!

85
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,439
Help!

86
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,680
Help! Help!

87
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,120
Help!

88
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,079
Help!

89
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Help!

90
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,199
Save me!

91
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,439
Help!

92
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,759
Help!

93
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,319
Help!

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,040
Save me!

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Help!

96
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,720
Help!

97
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,560
Help!

98
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,879
Help!

99
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,360
Help!

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,720
Help!

101
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,839
Help!

102
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,639
Help!

103
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,000
Help!

104
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,040
Help!

105
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,519
Help!

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,120
Save me!

107
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,399
Help!

108
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,759
Help!

109
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,680
Open the door!

110
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,920
Open the door!

111
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,879
Shen Jiaqin!

112
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,800
Shen Jiaqin, save me! Shen Jiaqin!

113
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,920
Shanshan!

114
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,800
Where are you?

115
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,120
You're finally here!

116
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,040
You have the watch!

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,360
The watch!

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,519
Who's there?

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,439
Shen Jiaqin!

120
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,480
Where is this place?

121
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,079
This is...

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,759
Whose memory is this?

123
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,240
Mr. Shen, the morgue is on B2.

124
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,920
Make the arrangements soon.

125
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,160
Let your mother rest in peace. Please accept our condolences.

126
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,160
I...

127
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,920
I don't have a mom anymore.

128
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:55,959
Me too.

129
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,560
But why don't I remember this?

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,480
Could this be a memory from back then,

131
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,279
that Shen Jiaqin and I experienced,

132
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,319
but was overwritten by the watch?

133
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,720
Bye bye!

134
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,040
Let's go!

135
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,879
Slow down, slow down!

136
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,720
I can't, I can't!

137
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,439
I really can't run anymore!

138
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,800
I want takoyaki!

139
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,680
After graduation,

140
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,399
who knows when

141
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,560
I'll get to eat this again.

142
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,319
Let's go eat now.

143
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,680
Let me ask you,

144
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,279
why did you take the college entrance exam a year early?

145
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,039
Wouldn't another year of study be safer?

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,120
I'll tell you tonight.

147
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,279
I say you'll definitely be a big star in the future, right?

148
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,799
Sounds like you've been to the future and seen it.

149
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,840
What if it's

150
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,919
you who came back from the future?

151
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
That was my mom's company.

152
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,519
You gave it to him?

153
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,320
He's just a bastard!

154
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,279
Why does he get to take

155
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,080
what my mom left for me?

156
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,200
Shen Jiaqin!

157
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,759
The people you care about

158
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,200
will all die.

159
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,399
Everything you care about

160
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,080
will die.

161
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,759
Yin Erfeng is dead.

162
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,080
Let me see.

163
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,159
Let me go in and see!

164
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,399
Let me see!

165
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,679
Calm down! Calm down!

166
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,960
Shen Jiaqin!

167
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,840
This is all your retribution!

168
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,120
Erfeng?

169
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,720
Erfeng?

170
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,399
You're still here.

171
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,960
I'm here.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,759
You're still here.

173
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,200
As long as you're here.

174
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,399
As long as you're here.

175
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,799
It's so late already.

176
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,159
Aren't we going back yet?

177
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,240
I'll go buy two bottles of water.

178
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,240
Wait for me.

179
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,639
Erfeng!

180
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,200
This is all your retribution!

181
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,240
I've tried countless methods.

182
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,279
I want to be with you.

183
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,559
I want a future with you.

184
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,720
But I don't know how to keep you.

185
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,399
I locked Shen Zhihe up.

186
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,080
Shen Jiaqin!

187
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,399
Let me out!

188
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,279
Took you away.

189
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,679
But...

190
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,600
No matter what I do,

191
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,759
I can't keep you.

192
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,000
The people you care about will all die.

193
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,679
Retribution.

194
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,320
I don't want to lose you.

195
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,519
I don't know what I should do

196
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,120
to be with you.

197
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,600
So...

198
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,720
Shen Jiaqin reversed time so many times

199
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,679
to save me.

200
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,639
All these things I never knew.

201
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,159
Jiaqin

202
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,840
Don't be sad.

203
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,519
Life and death are predetermined.

204
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,240
Mom.

205
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,720
I have nothing left.

206
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
The people I love the most...

207
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,919
I can't keep any of them.

208
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,559
I don't want to leave you.

209
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,120
And I don't want to leave her either.

210
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,159
Have you been to see it?

211
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:37,360
Mom.

212
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,679
Do you have a better way?

213
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,120
So I can keep you,

214
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,000
and keep her too?

215
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,759
My time is up.

216
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,320
Can't be saved.

217
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,000
If you still have an attachment to this world,

218
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,279
you can try to save the one

219
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,799
who is

220
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,600
most important to you.

221
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,240
But...

222
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,799
I miss you so much too.

223
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,240
Don't worry.

224
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,480
I will definitely try my best to save her.

225
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,960
But I've already tried so many times.

226
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,639
I simply have no way

227
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,879
to change her fate.

228
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,559
But I just don't believe it.

229
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,840
Because

230
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,840
I've already seen her future.

231
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,399
She was living well,

232
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,639
living happily.

233
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,039
So many people loved her.

234
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,639
She was doing things

235
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,200
she loved the most.

236
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,159
But I just...

237
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,919
You can try

238
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,159
to find the fork in the road of fate.

239
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,559
Ms. Yin was alive and well.

240
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,960
She accepted me,

241
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
she protected me,

242
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,960
let me grow up carefree.

243
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,559
I miss her.

244
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,039
I want to go home.

245
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,759
Why am I here?

246
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:31,679
Right!

247
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:33,799
The fork.

248
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,600
This...

249
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,279
is my most valuable possession.

250
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,919
I leave it to you.

251
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,399
In this lifetime,

252
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,440
I have no regrets.

253
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
I hope you can be like me,

254
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,159
strive for the ones you love.

255
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,600
Some things are destined.

256
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,159
Don't force it.

257
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,240
I understand.
