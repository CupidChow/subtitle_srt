1
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,920
Xu Jinbai, you...

2
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,359
I knew it

3
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,200
I knew you would still come

4
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,439
Why?

5
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,280
Why?

6
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,159
I want to know why, too

7
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,040
Ten years of feelings...

8
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,560
Why did it suddenly end

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,280
just like that, for no clear reason?

10
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,319
For the last month or two, yes

11
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,439
I disappeared

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,719
But you clearly know

13
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,079
what I was going through

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,680
I didn't do anything to hurt you

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,400
I didn't drag you down, did I?

16
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,599
I used a ten-year unfair contract to help you!

17
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,120
I was even willing to do that variety show debut

18
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,200
just to entertain you

19
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,560
Then tell me

20
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,319
why?

21
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,799
It's not like before

22
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,959
where you disappear for a month or two

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,719
and everything's fine after you entertaining me

24
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,640
I want to stand side-by-side

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,000
I want trust

26
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm not that little girl anymore

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,479
the one who followed you around

28
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,120
Xu Jinbai

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,719
what's the point of forcing things

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,560
like this?

31
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,240
Right

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,719
I am forcing it

33
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,680
Then tell me

34
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,400
what other way

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,719
do I have?

36
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,439
I just want to keep you by my side

37
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,080
Ten years

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,240
I protected you like a fragile flower

39
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,479
I didn't dare let the wind touch you

40
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,719
didn't dare let the rain soak you

41
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,800
Everything I did revolved around you

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,479
Do you know how ruthless Boss Zhang is?

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Normally, you see him

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,919
as a smiling, short, fat man

45
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,719
What I see

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,639
is a capitalist who eats people without spitting out the bones!

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
I made a deal with that devil, just...

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,919
because I didn't want you to leave

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,159
Before, I felt heartache for you

50
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,719
felt guilt

51
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,719
But now...

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,560
I find it pathetic

53
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,080
I admit

54
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,080
you protected me very well these ten years

55
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,159
That's why I became this...

56
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,080
glamorous

57
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,960
unaccomplished big star

58
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,639
I'm happy

59
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm the beneficiary

60
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,919
I have no right to blame you

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
But is this love?

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Ten years

63
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,479
Ten years of feelings

64
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,680
Haven't we always been like this?

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,199
How can you say this isn't love?

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,520
Have you forgotten?

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,599
Yes

68
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,759
These ten years...

69
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,919
You gave up art school

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,759
because I was sick

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,199
The surprises you planned for every one of my birthdays

72
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,759
For me

73
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,039
you fought with the company countless times

74
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,919
I remember it all

75
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,960
I will never forget any of it

76
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,399
But Xu Jinbai

77
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,160
all of that is in the past

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,040
I don't want to be

79
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,000
that flower, protected so well, anymore

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
I want to be someone with strength

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,519
with the ability to protect the people I love

82
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,399
If two people

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,399
love but don't stand together

84
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,600
don't share joys and sorrows

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,639
don't have trust...

86
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,839
Then they're not right for each other

87
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,439
Then it's not love

88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,519
You have no idea

89
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,160
how dangerous the outside world really is

90
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,959
I know

91
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,560
That's why I want to try

92
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
Do you remember?

93
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,639
There was one year

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
I found a really good script

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,879
I really wanted that role

96
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,560
You tried many ways to help me

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,199
called in many favors

98
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,759
But in the end

99
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,319
I still didn't get it

100
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,759
But if it were me now

101
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,639
I wouldn't be like that

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,800
I would study the script properly

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,079
and the character

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,839
See clearly where my abilities lie

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,519
If I still didn't get it

106
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,759
I'd prepare myself

107
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,519
and wait for the next opportunity

108
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,639
This is who I am now

109
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,959
You probably won't believe it

110
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,800
but I'm not that

111
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,240
stubborn little girl anymore

112
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,120
the one who followed you around demanding candy

113
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,759
acting spoiled and unreasonable

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,000
Please, don't want that anymore either, okay?

115
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,720
Have you seen Jinbai?

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,800
What did he say?

117
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,360
Whatever he decides to do in the end is up to him

118
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,519
I can accept it

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,439
Does it have to come to this?

120
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,839
I'm not the one causing trouble

121
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,000
Actually, when he first brought up the breakup

122
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,800
I had a really hard time adjusting

123
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,879
I didn't want to believe he was really leaving me

124
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,879
But during this time

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,079
I've thought a lot

126
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,639
We truly loved each other

127
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,480
That's a fact

128
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
But our love...

129
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,000
was too selfish

130
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
We both loved ourselves more

131
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,399
But we made it through all these years

132
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,000
Just because it lasted long

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,439
doesn't mean it was right

134
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,680
Maybe neither of us was willing to change

135
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,680
Real love

136
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,240
is finding more happiness

137
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,240
in the other person's joy than your own

138
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,839
Finding more happiness

139
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,720
in the other person's joy than your own?

140
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,199
Lin Ru

141
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,439
You understand

142
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,600
You clearly love him more than I do

143
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,319
That's comrade-in-arms friendship!

144
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,360
We're good friends

145
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:15,920
Hmm

146
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,079
I have a friend like that too

147
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,680
Shen Jiaqin?

148
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:26,920
Mm-hmm

149
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,399
So what exactly is your relationship now?

150
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,360
A couple?

151
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,960
Or is it one-sided?

152
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,240
We're just...

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,600
a contract couple

154
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,799
But it's definitely not one-sided on my part

155
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,840
Love-struck and hopeless

156
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,320
I just want to give it another try

157
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,919
I promise you

158
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,919
this time I won't let it affect my work

159
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,399
But you need to have work first

160
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,720
Should I discuss with the producers first

161
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,000
cancel tonight's press conference?

162
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,559
No!

163
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,720
But Jinbai's current state

164
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,919
is just too unstable

165
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,679
If this time

166
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,480
Jinbai insists on doing this...

167
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,159
I'm willing to face it

168
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,879
It didn't provoke you, did it?

169
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,679
Don't be nervous

170
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,679
What will be, will be

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
The male lead isn't here again?

172
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,159
Not yet, Director

173
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,480
Why did I say again?

174
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,600
Director, the male lead has a last-minute issue, he's not coming

175
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,720
Our press conference...

176
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,480
We have to start, with or without him

177
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,960
At worst, Mr. Shen can go on with the female lead

178
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,200
Mr. Shen isn't coming either

179
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,360
What?!

180
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,080
Sorry, everyone

181
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm late

182
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,720
My leading lady

183
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,399
should be escorted in by me personally

184
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,840
Smooth cooperation

185
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,639
Smooth

186
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,320
Where's Shen Jiaqin?

187
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,240
You've worked hard today

188
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,159
Shanshan

189
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,000
Congratulations

190
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,840
Thank you

191
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,559
I also want to apologize to you again

192
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,679
I'm sorry

193
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,559
Many of the things I said this morning

194
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,879
I said them deliberately for you to hear

195
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,600
Before you came to find me

196
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,480
Shen Jiaqin talked to me

197
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,399
You keep saying you love her

198
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,039
but right now, you're the one hurting her the most!

199
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,679
The matters between Shanshan and me

200
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,919
are none of your business as an outsider!

201
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,960
I'm just stating objective facts

202
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,120
and a foreseeable future

203
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,159
No one cares about the truth

204
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,639
behind scandals and rumors

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,879
In the future, whenever people see

206
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,320
Shanshan, they'll tell her

207
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,799
You have a scandalous past

208
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
You have a stain

209
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,440
Slowly, she'll fade from the screen

210
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,399
lose her job

211
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,480
lose her sunshine

212
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,320
lose her confidence

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,519
You'll keep her locked in this room

214
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
like a little golden canary

215
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,639
keeping her

216
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,480
Every day when you come home from work

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,480
she can only revolve around you

218
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,360
No life of her own

219
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,159
Only you

220
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,039
Is this the Yin Shanshan you want?

221
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,159
A Yin Shanshan you keep caged?

222
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,159
She never liked acting in the first place!

223
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,240
If she needs a career

224
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
I can build it back for her, bit by bit

225
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,679
I can provide for her forever!

226
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,799
But what if one day you're unwilling?

227
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,200
Impossible!

228
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,720
I've been with her for ten years already!

229
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,000
I wouldn't mind staying with her for the rest of my life!

230
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,879
You've only known her for a few days!

231
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,840
Who are you to stand here and judge?

232
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,639
I understand her far better than you do!

233
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,399
Understand?

234
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,000
If you understand her so well, haven't you noticed she's

235
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,600
changed?

236
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,639
She doesn't want to be your little canary anymore

237
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,120
She worked so hard

238
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,279
to get the chance of Coming for You

239
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,639
just to prove herself

240
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,720
To prove she has value

241
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
No one understands her better than I do

242
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,440
Let me make a bet with you

243
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,519
The old her when faced with difficulty

244
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,559
would definitely hide

245
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,360
This time, she definitely won't

246
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,240
Be careful of Shen Zhihe

247
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,840
If you win this bet

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
make this person stay away from Shanshan forever

249
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,679
Thank you

250
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,320
Although I really don't want to admit it...

251
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,679
but Shen Jiaqin...

252
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,200
He's... alright
