1
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:46,920
Ingenious

2
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,439
Absolutely ingenious

3
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,520
I've truly never seen anything like it

4
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,159
Master

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,000
I've already examined this watch

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,320
Many components differ from the blueprint

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,799
Please, this time

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,280
restore it according to the blueprint

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,560
Last time I was repairing it

10
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,640
there were a few parts

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I really didn't know how to place

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,599
So I took them off

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,000
and stored them

14
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,079
Let me try again

15
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,120
Thank you

16
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,200
I've talked Boss Zhang around

17
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,840
As long as we hype you and Xu Jinbai as a couple

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,760
he won't sue you

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,599
for contract termination

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,239
What?

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,120
Following Shen Jiaqin's approach

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,159
have the production team and paparazzi issue clarifications

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,280
I think this storm should blow over

24
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,359
Absolutely not

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
It's true that Jinbai and I had real feelings in the past

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,400
but after that...

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,359
I don't want to use our relationship

28
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,159
for publicity stunts

29
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,640
Our relationship as lovers is over

30
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,239
We can be colleagues

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,920
classmates, friends

32
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,560
We could even be strangers

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,760
but exploiting feelings for profit?

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm not willing

35
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,280
But Boss Zhang won't let you off the hook

36
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,239
So what?

37
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,800
At worst, I'll just pay the penalty

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,599
Money can always be earned again

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
And right now, it's just a scandal

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
I didn't break any laws

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,560
At most, I'll have no fans

42
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,120
no traffic

43
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,759
But Lin Ru

44
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,280
I am an actor

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
I talked with Director Chen for a long time last time

46
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,560
I figured out a lot of things

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,280
I don't want to be some big star

48
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,639
I want to be

49
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,560
a truly good actor

50
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,800
Director Chen has a friend who produces many stage plays

51
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,479
Although they're just small theaters

52
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,919
stage acting

53
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,719
can truly hone your skills

54
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,280
It's just...

55
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,159
It might mean hard times for you and Xiao Xia

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,840
You still have the mind to worry about us two?

57
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,439
You make it sound so easy

58
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,840
Just wait until you can't even afford a hotel

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,919
try sharing a room then

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,639
I've shared rooms before

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,599
And if things really become unbearable

62
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,360
I can just go home

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
My mom will take care of me

64
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,479
Lately

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,919
you've all changed so much

66
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,479
Young man

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,439
I remember now

68
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,000
I've seen it before

69
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,360
You've felt trapped, haven't you?

70
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,599
You know it?

71
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,479
There is a space within this watch?

72
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,479
When an accident occurs while using it

73
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,919
you'll end up there

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,280
There, you will see those

75
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,879
timelines that were overwritten because of this watch

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,479
Time isn't something we ordinary people

77
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,000
can borrow against

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,319
I understand

79
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
Everything has cause and effect

80
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,360
This price...

81
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm afraid you cannot bear it

82
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,879
Young man

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,639
you're pushing your body way too hard.

84
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,360
You should just enjoy the present

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,599
His time is running out

86
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,520
Thank you

87
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,120
But for her, I'm willing

88
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,839
Unconsciously drank so much again

89
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,839
What time is it now?

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,079
Has the finale aired?

91
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,720
Just got back from recording

92
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,120
Drunk again

93
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,800
So the dating show finale

94
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,480
just finished recording

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,240
I was drinking at the Door of Love

96
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
then came back to the hotel

97
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,639
Then...

98
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,439
Who brought me back?

99
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,360
Shen Jiaqin

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,560
You were drunk, clinging to him all the way back

101
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,439
Luckily, I intercepted you

102
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,160
Otherwise, I was afraid you'd...

103
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,959
get photographed while drunk

104
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,759
Too late

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,839
What was photographed?

106
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,879
Explain it clearly!

107
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,360
We've already been photographed

108
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,639
The watch is still broken

109
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,120
Quick!

110
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,040
Shen Jiaqin!

111
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,720
Hurry up, quick!

112
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,000
Shen Jiaqin!

113
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,839
Shen Jiaqin!

114
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's go public

115
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,879
No

116
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,680
Since the paparazzo works for your rival

117
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,079
he'll keep watching you constantly

118
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,360
We might avoid it today

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,480
but what about tomorrow?

120
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,920
The day after? The day after that?

121
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,480
Do we have to keep hiding like this?

122
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,399
What if I slip up and get into another scandal?

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,759
I'll keep my distance from you

124
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,720
Keep your distance?

125
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,399
Think about it

126
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,079
How many times have we been photographed already?

127
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,639
You always say that

128
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,120
but can you really do it?

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,360
I don't like you

130
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,279
Shen Jiaqin, tell me

131
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,079
Why are you so afraid of falling for me?

132
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,240
Because I can't

133
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,160
Those I care about... all die

134
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,399
Contract couple

135
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,639
Acting the part

136
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,000
It's not real anyway

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
What are you so afraid of?

138
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,399
We can avoid the PR storm

139
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,199
and promote your hotels

140
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,759
I get to act smoothly

141
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,759
Three birds with one stone

142
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,440
Why not go for it?

143
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,919
Fine

144
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,519
So

145
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,600
how do we do it?

146
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,440
As long as we break the news ourselves

147
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,559
before the paparazzi

148
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,879
then the hot search list

149
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,720
will be dominated by topics we control

150
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,080
Other news

151
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,679
will be buried

152
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,759
The Confession Night

153
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,879
Xiao Xia recorded the whole video on the side

154
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,240
That's our bargaining chip

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
Make the production team

156
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,000
modify the footage

157
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,080
If they don't air it as agreed

158
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,159
we'll release our own footage

159
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,639
Lu Yun, try your best

160
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,159
to identify all the nearby paparazzi

161
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,960
Ensure there are no other

162
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
photos that can distort the truth

163
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,799
The main building road runs east to west, chase them!

164
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,720
Dusk is the time of day

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,080
when my eyesight is at its worst

166
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,000
These two are ignoring me

167
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Forget it

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't need too many people anyway

169
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,399
Got it

170
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,480
Just posting a Weibo to witness love, right?

171
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,399
you are my idol

172
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,159
We also need to create an authentic scene

173
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,080
to prove the love is real

174
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,919
Do we really have to do this?

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,559
Mm-hmm

176
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,120
Write it just like that

177
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,559
What made my heart flutter was

178
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,600
that moment, luckily, it was you

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,639
From massive online backlash to a sweet official announcement

180
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,480
Yin Shanshan stages a comeback with talent and love

181
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,720
This couple's looks and style

182
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,240
directly book them as the year's most eye-catching pair

183
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,399
Shen Group's stock rises due to the relationship announcement

184
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,159
Yin Shanshan's commercial value is soaring

185
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,519
My script is finally over

186
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,639
From now on, I only ship real couples

187
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,759
So the secret crush couple was real!

188
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,440
The Sentimental Couple isn't just sentimental!

189
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,320
They're for real!

190
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,840
Which dating show is this sweet, with after-sales service!

191
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,639
Have the employees go like more posts on Weibo

192
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,600
That one post

193
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,480
get more likes

194
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:23,840
Right

195
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,320
It's blowing up! Blowing up!

196
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,639
Overwhelmingly shipping you two!

197
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,200
Hype couple is indeed useful

198
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,919
We're not hyping it

199
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,039
Seems like...

200
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,600
it's not entirely one-sided

201
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,519
If this gets confirmed tonight

202
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,919
this actress is done for

203
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,840
Is Yin Shanshan's team

204
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,519
frantically doing PR right now?

205
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,240
Suggest the boyfriend come out with a truth

206
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,960
Make this kind of actress out the industry

207
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,440
It's you

208
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,559
What do you want?

209
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,720
Shanshan has already gone public

210
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,399
The dating show will be re-edited

211
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,000
It's already settled

212
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,320
You've known me for so many years

213
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,120
don't you know what I want?

214
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,720
I want her to come back

215
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,559
Tonight, at the same time as the press conference

216
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,799
I'll do a live stream with the paparazzo

217
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,799
Make Shanshan come to me Otherwise...

218
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,799
I don't know what I might say

219
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,559
Xu Jinbai!

220
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,639
You're insane!

221
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,919
Maybe I am

222
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,080
Famous Actress Dumps Long-term Boyfriend

223
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,480
for Contractual Relationship

224
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,399
With them doing this

225
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,840
public opinion will explode

226
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,080
Boss

227
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,600
shouldn't we take some measures?

228
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:33,759
Didn't you...

229
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,879
Did you...

230
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,639
used the watch to reverse time again?

231
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,480
Do you know your physical

232
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,440
condition is very serious?

233
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,440
If you keep this up, you'll have to be hospitalized

234
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,799
This...

235
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,759
You don't want

236
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,279
to be locked in a hospital, unable to see her

237
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:49,720
do you?

238
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,159
Don't use it anymore

239
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,480
Really, don't use it anymore

240
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,559
No matter what happens, don't use it again

241
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,360
She won't die

242
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
but you will!

243
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,679
Take it to that watch shop

244
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,559
Fix it according to the blueprint

245
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,679
You're still like this? You...

246
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,120
Fix it according to the blueprint

247
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,559
Tonight, at the same time as the press conference

248
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,720
I'll do a live stream with the paparazzo

249
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,200
Make Shanshan come to me

250
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Otherwise...

251
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,919
I don't know what I might say

252
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,879
Why isn't Jinbai here yet?

253
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,720
The press conference is about to start

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,919
It didn't provoke you, did it?

255
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:41,960
What are you thinking about?

256
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,080
Why are you so distracted?

257
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,960
The press conference is about to start

258
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,639
Why aren't the investor and the male lead here yet?

259
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,759
Yeah, why aren't they here yet?

260
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,679
It couldn't be...

261
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,840
That day

262
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,279
what I said to Jinbai...

263
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,440
hurt his feelings?

264
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,120
Probably not

265
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,200
Jinbai isn't that petty

266
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,320
Where's the male lead?

267
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,399
Not here yet, Director

268
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:16,960
Not here

269
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,639
Director

270
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,519
the male lead has a last-minute issue, he's not coming

271
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,840
Our press conference...

272
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,720
We have to start, come what may

273
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,000
At worst, President Shen can go on with the female lead

274
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,519
President Shen isn't coming either

275
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,200
What?!

276
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:30,320
I'm here

277
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,679
Welcome everyone to

278
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,360
the press conference for Coming for You

279
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,080
They say the Sentimental Couple

280
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,960
went from the movie to reality

281
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,519
So today, the two of you

282
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,039
have come hand-in-hand to our

283
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,960
press conference

284
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,039
Let's welcome them

285
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,759
I'd like to ask Miss Shanshan

286
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,200
is it true, as netizens say

287
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,799
that you fell deeply in love while studying the script

288
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,759
and thus fell for Mr. Shen?

289
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,919
Indeed

290
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,960
our script

291
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,879
is extremely moving

292
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,480
Mr. Shen and I

293
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,679
have genuine feelings

294
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,799
unrelated to work

295
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,879
Alright, then let everyone present

296
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,519
once again send their blessings to Shanshan and Mr. Shen

297
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,080
The warmer the applause

298
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,480
the more blessings you receive!

299
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,039
I am Xu Jinbai

300
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,720
Yin Shanshan, did you really pursue Mr. Shen

301
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,440
and abandon Xu Jinbai after ten years in love?

302
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,759
But she pursued Shen Jiaqin and abandoned me!

303
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,559
She abandoned our ten years of beautiful memories!

304
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:58,919
Shanshan!

305
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
She abandoned the youth we spent together!

306
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,919
Stop filming! Stop!

307
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,200
Stop filming!

308
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,960
Stop! Stop filming! Stop!

309
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,559
Stop!

310
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,319
Did you really abandon him, Shanshan?

311
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:09,880
Sorry!

312
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,799
Why did you abandon him?

313
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,640
Was it for Shen Jiaqin?

314
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,039
Shanshan!

315
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:12,960
Stop, stop filming!

316
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,599
Stop!

317
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,599
Don't leave me!

318
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Can you answer us?

319
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,839
Shanshan! Shanshan!

320
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,920
No more filming!

321
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,240
Quick, chase them! Over there!

322
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,079
There, there!

323
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,319
Please answer! Answer us!

324
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,519
Stop filming!

325
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,319
Boss!

326
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,920
Please answer us!

327
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,440
Shanshan, answer us, Shanshan!

328
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,720
If it's Jinbai...

329
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,559
I have to face it myself

330
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,359
But definitely not like this

331
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,359
Can't use it again

332
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,599
It's blowing up! Blowing up!

333
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,759
Overwhelmingly shipping you two!

334
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,400
Hype couple is indeed useful

335
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,279
Seems like it's not entirely one-sided

336
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,480
Shen Jiaqin!

337
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,480
Shen Jiaqin!

338
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,960
What's wrong with Jinbai?

339
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,680
He's going live tonight

340
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,039
Shanshan

341
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,079
don't panic yet

342
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,079
He's doing a live stream tonight

343
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,119
He's going to expose me for cheating

344
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:28,799
How do you know?

345
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,279
Did he contact you?

346
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,480
You know it?
