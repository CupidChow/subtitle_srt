1
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,640
Is something wrong, Miss Yin?

2
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,799
Mr. Shen.

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,439
As long as I don't run into you,

4
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,640
I won't have any trouble.

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,320
Let's just keep our distance.

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,159
You stay out of my business, and I'll stay out of yours.

7
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,640
Thanks. Let's just pretend today never happened.

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,119
Shanshan!

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,119
Isn't that Yin Shanshan?

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,640
You're really well-informed!

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,159
Perfect timing to catch such a juicy scene.

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,879
I knew they were sneaking around.

13
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:05,879
Something's definitely up.

14
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,079
Care to explain?

15
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,719
Stop filming!

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,560
Let's go.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,840
Stop filming!

18
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,079
Shanshan!

19
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,560
No way...

20
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:20,680
Shanshan!

21
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:21,799
Shanshan!

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,519
Shen Jiaqin, you jinx!

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,439
You got me into trouble again!

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,439
Again?

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,760
Okay.

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,799
Now, let's welcome our bridesmaid!

27
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,519
Stuck on the same day, huh?

28
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,760
A single-day loop?

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,920
Infinite flow genre?

30
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,560
I'm the master of my own fate!

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,920
Let's see how long this loop can last!

32
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,599
Time loop is science fiction...

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,800
Because of his obsession...

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,719
I'm trapped in a tim...

35
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,120
Because of his obsession...

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm trapped in a time loop.

37
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,840
His obsession...

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,319
Let me go, Jin!

39
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't call him that!

40
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,719
Over here! Look here!

41
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,000
Look here! This way!

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
Over here!

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,039
Shen Jia...

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,680
...qin!

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,599
Boss!

46
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,479
You used the watch again?

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,479
In your condition,

48
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,599
you can't keep pushing yourself.

49
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,719
We need to screen all the media

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,120
attending today's event thoroughly.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,680
Security around Shanshan must be tightened.

52
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,680
Is Miss Yin having some kind of problem?

53
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,199
I'm worried her life might be in danger.

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,719
Everything was taken from me.

55
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,360
The people you care about...

56
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,080
...will all die.

57
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,800
Wait.

58
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,000
What is it?

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
That's...

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,000
Him.

61
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,240
Could he be the one with the obsession?

62
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,280
Shen Jiaqin.

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
First time, the paparazzi on the rooftop.

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,879
Second time, in the hallway.

65
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,479
Third time, the paparazzi in the garden.

66
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,360
Stop filming!

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
Fourth time, the parking garage paparazzi.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,039
Every time the paparazzi show up...

69
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,240
Shen Jiaqin is there.

70
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,000
He must be behind all of this.

71
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm fine.

72
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,399
But...

73
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,439
Why?

74
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,160
The press conference is almost over.

75
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,360
Actually, our creative team

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,079
has prepared a surprise for our two leads.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Please look at the screen.

78
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,240
Because Eternal Resentment

79
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,600
tells the story of two women's growth,

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,279
our creative team

81
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,800
collected photos from

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
both actresses' careers since their debut.

83
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,720
We've made them into a photo album.

84
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,639
This is a photo of Shanshan before she was famous.

85
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,319
You found a photo

86
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,399
from so many years ago?

87
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,360
Doesn't this person look a lot like Shen Jiaqin?

88
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,519
Isn't that you?

89
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:10,959
I told you to stop the reporter.

90
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,920
Did you stop him?

91
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,759
Relax.

92
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,240
They're completely blocked.

93
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:15,680
Boss,

94
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,240
why are you so sure it's him?

95
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,040
At the hotel entrance...

96
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,279
Wait.

97
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,079
A man named Li Zihang

98
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,120
disguised as a reporter...

99
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,199
I caught him red-handed.

100
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:24,639
Mr. Shen.

101
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,040
What can I do for you?

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,639
Did Shen Zhihe send you?

103
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,839
Shen Zhihe again?

104
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,800
Then Miss Yin must be in great danger.

105
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,720
That lunatic Shen Zhihe...

106
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,920
I won't let him hurt Shanshan.

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,759
What's the conflict between you brothers

108
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,439
that can't be resolved after all these years?

109
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,560
The people you care about will all die! All of them!

110
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,160
I won't let the tragedy happen again.

111
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,199
Ms. Yin.

112
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,959
I'll make this quick.

113
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,199
I have another engagement later.

114
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,480
Quick, take a picture of my high school alumni roster,

115
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,160
the student directory,

116
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,720
and send it to me. I need it.

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,240
What do you need the roster for?

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,360
I told you, I need it!

119
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
Just send it to me!

120
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:07,879
Fine, fine, fine.

121
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,560
Shen Jiaqin.

122
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,959
It is you.

123
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,240
You had a crush on me?

124
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,720
Love turned to hate?

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,879
But why?

126
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,680
I don't remember having a classmate like you.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,399
Today, I will bring your secret crush

128
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
into the light!

129
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,439
Shen Jiaqin!

130
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,839
Do you have a crush on me?

131
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
Shy, huh?

132
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,000
I knew it! Your obsession is because

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,920
you secretly like me!

134
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,879
Today, I'm here to break your obsession!

135
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,040
Oh no.

136
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,879
Boss, don't!

137
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,959
My room again?

138
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,079
I'm back again.

139
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,319
That doesn't make sense. I already exposed his secret.

140
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,519
Did I... Did I break the loop?

141
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,919
I already called him out on his crush.

142
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,120
Why isn't the loop broken?

143
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,159
But this time I wasn't attacked.

144
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
It really is related to him.

145
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,600
Could it be...

146
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,039
I reawakened his feelings for me?

147
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,679
So now he can't bring himself to hurt me?

148
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,080
What does this novel even mean?

149
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,799
Author... Yi Yi.

150
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,440
Yi Yi?

151
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,480
Isn't the screenwriter for my show named Yi Yi?

152
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,759
Teacher Yi Yi!

153
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,799
This... love story about a time loop...

154
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,200
Did you write it?

155
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,799
Yes.

156
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,399
It's so good!

157
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,600
Such rich imagination!

158
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,840
A moving story!

159
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,840
Thank you.

160
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,919
You haven't finished serializing it, right?

161
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm really curious about the ending.

162
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,240
The female lead is trapped in a time loop

163
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,759
because of the male lead's obsession.

164
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,159
So what does the female lead need to do

165
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,639
to break his obsession?

166
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,480
Well, you see,

167
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,960
the male lead has always had a crush on the female lead.

168
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,039
He's done so many things for her in secret.

169
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:58,960
His obsession

170
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,679
triggered a chain reaction in spacetime,

171
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,960
trapping the female lead in the same moment,

172
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,679
constantly meeting the male lead again.

173
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,799
In the end,

174
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,240
she discovers his hidden love.

175
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,159
But if she's already discovered it,

176
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,320
if she's already confronted him about it,

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,159
why hasn't the time loop ended?

178
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,279
Please, tell me.

179
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,120
Discovery requires action!

180
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,000
Finally, the two lovers get their happy ending,

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
and the female lead naturally breaks free from the time prison.

182
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,600
Get their happy ending...

183
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,720
Mr. Shen.

184
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,200
What did you need?

185
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,519
Boring.

186
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,000
You called me here just for this?

187
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,919
I thought...

188
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,679
you'd finally come to your senses

189
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,960
and were giving me the hotel.

190
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,360
Hiring shady reporters, maliciously approaching Yin Shanshan...

191
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,639
What are you trying to do?

192
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,720
Make her disappear.

193
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,200
Ruin your plans.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,879
And then...

195
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,240
be a good boy.

196
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,879
This is a crime!

197
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,679
What are you talking about?

198
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,159
Where's your evidence?

199
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,799
I told you,

200
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
the people you care about

201
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,080
will all...

202
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,240
Yin Shanshan and I have no relationship.

203
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,399
If that's the case...

204
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
then she's even more expendable.

205
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,600
Shen Zhihe!

206
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,399
You're beyond hope.

207
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,360
I love it when you talk to me like that.

208
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,879
Shen Jiaqin!

209
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,320
Caught you!

210
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:40,960
Shen Jiaqin!

211
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,279
Do you...

212
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,320
...like me?

213
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,159
Um...

214
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,399
Sorry,

215
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,279
I got the wrong person.

216
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,399
Shen Jiaqin!

217
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,200
This is the kind of woman you like?

218
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,840
Happy ending...

219
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,080
Need to take action...

220
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,279
Take action to get the happy ending.

221
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,960
Action, action... Isn't that just confessing?

222
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,240
Who is it?

223
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,279
Shh! Don't talk. There are reporters outside.

224
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,279
Shen Jiaqin!

225
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,799
You pervert!

226
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,720
You're not wearing clothes!

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Are you crazy?

228
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,399
This is the men's locker room!

229
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,960
And... and there are urinals over there!

230
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,879
What are you looking at, Yin Erfeng!

231
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,679
You know my name is Yin Erfeng?

232
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,159
And you said you didn't know me!

233
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,799
I don't know.

234
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,039
It's fine.

235
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,000
I remember you.

236
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
Out of all the boys in our year,

237
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,080
you were the one

238
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:18,960
I liked the most.

239
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,639
We weren't in the same year.

240
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,799
You remember me even though we weren't?

241
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,279
So you had a crush on your senior?

242
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,600
Well,

243
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,919
it makes sense.

244
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,000
I was so pretty, I used to get love letters all the time.

245
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,120
But thinking about it now,

246
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,679
missing out on you is the biggest regret of my life.

247
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:46,919
So...

248
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
if we could start over,

249
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,200
could you give me a chance?

250
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,360
No.

251
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,200
Please leave.

252
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:13,879
Thank you.

253
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,879
Are you lashing out

254
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,240
because you can't have me?

255
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,120
I already told you!

256
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,879
I could love you!

257
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:27,639
As long as...

258
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,799
As long as nothing, you idiot!

259
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,720
Yin Erfeng!

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,039
Why should I like you?

261
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,559
I told you I don't like you!

262
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,879
Are you forcing me to like you?

263
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,600
What,

264
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,360
are you made of gold?

265
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,039
Do I have to like you?

266
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,399
Because of your yellow eyebrows?

267
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,559
You think I want to look for you?

268
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,519
It's because you keep showing up

269
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,399
in my life,

270
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,679
making everything worse!

271
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,279
If you hate me so much,

272
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,600
then take a look at this!

273
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
Isn't this you in the photo?

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,759
Miss Yin, I know your real name

275
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,960
because you used it

276
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,000
to check into the hotel.

277
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,639
Why do you have a habit of collecting photos?

278
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,759
Get out

279
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,240
I...

280
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,600
Hurry up!

281
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,840
Time loop...

282
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,039
She seems to have memories.

283
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,000
It seems staying away from her

284
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,679
is the best choice for her.

285
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,879
I already confessed!

286
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Why am I back again?

287
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,920
If the female lead just insincerely says

288
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,079
I remember you,

289
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,720
I love you, and the loop breaks,

290
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
how are we supposed to fill the runtime?

291
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,960
Shameless screenwriter!

292
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,240
What?

293
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,920
I said, you are such a dedicated screenwriter!

294
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,640
So could you tell me,

295
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,759
what does the female lead

296
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,839
really need to do

297
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,480
to escape this time loop?

298
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,279
The male lead needs to

299
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,720
truly feel her love, of course.

300
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,839
Truly feel the love...

301
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,200
So that means saying I love you

302
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,839
more sincerely?

303
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,359
Make it feel real?

304
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,279
Stay away from her.

305
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,000
Stay away from her.

306
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,519
Remember, Shen Jiaqin,

307
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,200
you must stay away from Yin Shanshan.

308
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,039
This time, I can't let anything happen to her.
