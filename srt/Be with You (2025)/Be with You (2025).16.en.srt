1
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,399
You are here, bro.

2
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,000
Have some tea to cool down.

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,920
This was Dad's favorite.

4
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,520
Are you insane?

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,560
Haven't you known that for a while?

6
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,960
What are you doing?

7
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,000
What are you trying to do?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,240
I just want to know...

9
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,040
...since you're so protective of Yin Shanshan,

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,680
if I were to compare myself to her,

11
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,799
who would you care about more?

12
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,840
Don't give me that, Shen Zhihe.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Haven't I been tolerant enough?

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,560
I've let you have your way, again and again,

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,599
just to maintain the last shred of dignity.

16
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,760
Do you understand?

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,280
Well, thank you for that... brother.

18
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,719
If I remember correctly,

19
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,200
tomorrow is the final day

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,120
of your variety show, right?

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Confession Night.

22
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,079
Do you think she'll say yes to you?

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,840
Threatening me?

24
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,280
Who she chooses

25
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,760
is her right and her freedom.

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,799
It has nothing to do with you.

27
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,120
Boss.

28
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,319
The program crew has restored

29
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,400
phone service for everyone.

30
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,960
That photographer Zhang Jian, the one Miss Yin saw,

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
has been caught.

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,560
Boss,

33
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,639
shouldn't you go for a follow-up checkup?

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,039
Boss, wait, don't—

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,639
If you're not feeling well, ask the crew for leave.

36
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,120
One day won't matter.

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,439
I'm fine.

38
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,560
It's just the last day.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,280
I can manage.

40
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,199
Everyone, please take your positions according to the official pairs.

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,199
Thank you.

42
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,080
Today is the final day of Date with You.

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,680
We've also invited the mothers of our guests.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,639
Shen Jiaqin has done so much for me in secret,

45
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,280
but he never mentioned any of it.

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,439
Why didn't he say anything?

47
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
Why?

48
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,159
Shanshan!

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,919
Look at what Mom's wearing today.

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,080
How do I look?

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,000
Beautiful.

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Making you proud, right?

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,319
Stunning.

54
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,120
Your show is so good!

55
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,960
I've been binge-watching it for days.

56
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,840
I never thought I'd get to be here today.

57
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,319
Look at all these

58
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,680
kitchen utensils prepared.

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,879
Do they really expect us to cook?

60
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,599
Aren't we just pretending?

61
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,080
Ms. Yin,

62
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,439
variety shows aren't as easy as you think.

63
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,080
Keep your voice down, they're recording everything.

64
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,120
Okay, okay, got it.

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,719
So,

66
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,039
that talented

67
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,120
and handsome Director Chen, is he here?

68
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,680
Isn't this his show?

69
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,719
He's the director for the upcoming movie,

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,759
not the variety show.

71
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,680
He just observes us

72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,479
for the show.

73
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,439
I've been tricked.

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,759
So, I came all this way today

75
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,280
and won't even see Director Chen?

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,639
Then who am I supposed to date?

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,719
Ms. Yin,

78
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,120
I'm the one dating,

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,039
not you.

80
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,919
I know, I know.

81
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,159
Why are you taking it out on the knife?

82
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,400
Tell Mom the truth.

83
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,120
Did you have a fight with Xiao Bai?

84
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,840
Quiet.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,840
Well, actually...

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,319
He and I...

87
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,120
broke up a while ago.

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,800
You broke up?

89
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,160
Did he cheat?

90
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,519
Shh!

91
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,000
Why?

92
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,199
Nothing like that, stop making things up.

93
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,920
Stop cutting.

94
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,279
Put the knife down.

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,600
Shanshan,

96
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,360
let me tell you something.

97
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,120
In this world,

98
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,600
not everyone revolves around you,

99
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
trying to make you happy all the time.

100
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,519
Whether someone is good to you

101
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,199
and puts in the effort,

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,879
you can see it.

103
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,279
That's right. You have to feel it with your heart.

104
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,399
I can see it.

105
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,120
Auntie.

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,680
Young man, have we met before?

107
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,959
First time meeting you, Auntie.

108
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you like our Shanshan?

109
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,319
I think she's quite interesting.

110
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
I saw you.

111
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,040
Sitting over there,

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,439
sneaking glances at my daughter nonstop.

113
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,480
If you like her,

114
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,199
then be brave and confess your feelings.

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,839
The more people who like our Shanshan,

116
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,279
the more choices she has!

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm happy.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,879
As long as you're happy.

119
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,680
Just now,

120
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
watching you and Shanshan,

121
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,240
I just felt the two of you together

122
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,959
looked really good, really happy.

123
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,120
Spend more time with Shanshan when you can.

124
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,040
So you do like Shanshan!

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,360
Young man,

126
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,160
I'll go check on the others now.

127
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,120
Wait—

128
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,439
Is there something else?

129
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,639
Watch out for that rope.

130
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,439
Okay, okay.

131
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,759
Thank you.

132
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,040
Was my mom just...

133
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,920
trying to set us up?

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,639
Don't mind her.

135
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,079
Her head is always full of romance.

136
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,600
In that regard, you two are quite alike.

137
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,600
That doesn't sound like a compliment.

138
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,199
It is a compliment.

139
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,040
Really?

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,720
Really.

141
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,800
Erfeng's mother is still around.

142
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,839
That's wonderful.

143
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,519
Go on, cry! Make a scene!

144
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,560
Keep causing trouble!

145
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,360
How old are you?

146
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,240
You still can't control your emotions at your age?

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,199
Was I wrong in what I said about you?

148
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,319
Look at the opening just now.

149
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,319
Yin Shanshan got so many shots.

150
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:05,879
And you?

151
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,720
You're just a minor character now.

152
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,279
What?

153
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,079
You debuted earlier than her!

154
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,279
You've won more awards than her!

155
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,439
It's only been a few years.

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,240
How did you end up like this?

157
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,680
You know, when I first debuted,

158
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,800
I really admired Cao Wen.

159
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,639
She was so beautiful,

160
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,000
so talented, and such a great actress.

161
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,680
I never thought

162
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,959
the truth would be like this.

163
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,800
Does anyone even like you anymore?

164
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,120
Quite a few people still like me.

165
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,439
I check the rankings every day.

166
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,519
Your support rate is the lowest.

167
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,680
Those two guys on the show,

168
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,879
are you even worthy of their affection?

169
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,439
They're just acting for a variety show,

170
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,720
and you're taking it seriously?

171
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
How ridiculous.

172
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,839
Other's situations...

173
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,000
We don't know the root cause.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,959
If you go in now,

175
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,240
she'll only resent you more.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Auntie, my name is Luo Keke.

177
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm one of the two guys you mentioned.

178
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,879
I genuinely like Cao Wen.

179
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm not acting.

180
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,080
She can take it seriously.

181
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,720
How old are you?

182
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,440
Saying you like Cao Wen now...

183
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
Later, when she gets old,

184
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,799
and you're still in your prime,

185
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,039
will you still like her then?

186
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,840
If I stand here now,

187
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,039
I can guarantee it for a lifetime.

188
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,600
That might be a bold claim.

189
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,320
But I can promise

190
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,039
that every day from now on,

191
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,879
I will remind myself

192
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
how much I love her at this very moment.

193
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,600
I will strive to love her just like I do today.

194
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,639
If one day I wake up

195
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,879
and find my love has changed,

196
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,240
I will tell her,

197
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,919
and give her everything I have as compensation.

198
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,840
What nonsense are you talking?

199
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
I mean every word.

200
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,879
There are no cameras here, Cao Wen.

201
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,399
I've liked you

202
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,519
from the moment I saw you.

203
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,080
I was just too young back then.

204
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,399
Now I've grown up.

205
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,120
I'm an adult.

206
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,919
I can finally bravely say I love you.

207
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,320
Auntie,

208
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,480
she's hurt.

209
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,240
I need to take her to see a doctor.

210
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,879
He's not just anybody.

211
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,039
This is true love.

212
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,320
Thank you, Shen Jiaqin.

213
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,080
Thank you for saving me

214
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,639
during that graduation camping trip.

215
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,480
You should thank Xu Jinbai for that.

216
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,799
Still won't admit it.

217
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,039
This heart-fluttering holiday is coming to an end.

218
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,159
Have you found the one who makes your heart race?

219
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,519
Do you have the courage

220
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,080
to make your final love confession?

221
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,679
Our three goddesses are now standing at the Door of Love.

222
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,320
Gentlemen who are ready,

223
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,519
please step behind the one who makes your heart flutter.

224
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,120
Please turn around.

225
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,279
See if the person you desire stands before you.

226
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,919
Shanshan,

227
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,440
can you give me another chance?

228
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,200
We've already spent one decade together.

229
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,240
I believe our future

230
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,559
holds many more decades for us.

231
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,879
To be honest,

232
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,279
the familiarity between us,

233
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,120
that sense of closeness...

234
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
I can't let it go.

235
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,480
After all, you're in

236
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,919
every frame of my youth.

237
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,960
My first time skipping class,

238
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,639
my first date,

239
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,799
my first time watching fireworks...

240
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,879
I experienced them all with you.

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,919
But Xu Jinbai,

242
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,639
we can't go back.

243
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,639
We can be family,

244
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,519
but we can't be lovers anymore.

245
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,159
I thought so.

246
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:43,799
But you know,

247
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,879
I can't just give up like this.

248
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,679
What if I told you

249
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,039
the reason why I left back then?

250
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,039
Would you give me another chance?

251
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,559
No.

252
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,879
Production team!

253
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,360
The public admirer's confession is over.

254
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,559
Can the secret admirer come up now?

255
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:14,960
What?

256
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,720
We don't have that segment.

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,399
It's fine, let me observe for a moment.

258
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,279
Yin Shanshan!

259
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,600
Wait, wait!

260
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,360
Let's just watch for now, okay?

261
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,440
I didn't prepare a confession.

262
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,840
Okay.

263
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:46,600
Shen Jiaqin,

264
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,320
then I'll be the one to confess.

265
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,759
Let's go, stop pulling me.

266
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,559
Let's go, let go.

267
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,720
You were

268
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,360
definitely listening carefully to what I said.

269
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,240
I don't know if you've

270
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,279
experienced those moments.

271
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,440
I also don't know

272
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,200
who you experienced them with before.

273
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,720
I just hope...

274
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,200
...that in the future, for those experiences,

275
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,399
it can be me.

276
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,879
I want to get to know you all over again.

277
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,720
I want...

278
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,799
...us to have the chance

279
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,519
to experience things anew.

280
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,320
I haven't known you for long,

281
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,399
but you're always lying to me.

282
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:35,440
Yet your

283
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
actions are always genuine.

284
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
My mom told me

285
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,399
whether someone truly cares for another person,

286
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,120
the other person can feel it.

287
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,960
I think...

288
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,759
...you do care about me.

289
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:16,799
The people you care about...

290
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:25,919
You're overthinking it.

291
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,159
I don't like you.

292
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,399
Mr. Shen,

293
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,200
sorry to bother you.

294
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,039
Our show

295
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,919
needs to give the audience an ending.

296
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,440
Could you help us out by improvising a few lines?

297
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,600
Perform a little,

298
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,639
pretend to accept the confession.

299
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,519
Once this show wraps,

300
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,919
Coming for You starts filming.

301
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,440
You're the investor.

302
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,480
Consider it a warm-up for the movie.

303
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,720
Let's go.

304
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,559
You know you're a terrible singer, right?

305
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
And you're tone-deaf.

306
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,320
But you're very pretty.

307
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,799
And very smart.

308
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,799
You can do so much better.

309
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm not right for you.

310
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,720
Okay, look here!

311
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,080
Three, two, one! Happy wrap!

312
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,120
Okay, perfect!

313
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,639
Well, I... I don't drink, so...

314
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,519
I'll head off first.

315
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,600
Don't want the fans to see me.

316
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,759
Cheers!

317
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,119
You know,

318
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,359
it's so funny.

319
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,799
Afraid I'd be left out,

320
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,880
they specially got Haoran to confess to me.

321
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,000
On the whole show,

322
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,160
we had zero interaction.

323
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,119
You know that.

324
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,880
And the script specifically said

325
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,839
I had to sincerely accept him.

326
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,480
This show is so scripted.

327
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,599
But over here,

328
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,799
isn't there another person

329
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,599
who was forced to act on set today?

330
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,480
Don't look.

331
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,279
Good thing you brought that up.

332
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,440
If he didn't like you,

333
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,799
I'd say he and I would be a good match.

334
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,039
He doesn't like me.

335
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,920
I might believe that you don't like him,

336
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,240
but I don't believe for a second that he doesn't like you.
