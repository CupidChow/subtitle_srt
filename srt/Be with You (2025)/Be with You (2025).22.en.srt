1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,240
Thank you

2
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,159
Thank you both

3
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,359
Wishing you a lifetime of happiness together

4
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,000
Bye!

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,280
Bye! Bye!

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,520
Announcing our relationship...

7
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,600
real or not...

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,799
feels damn good

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,159
Before, when you walked down the street

10
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,640
lots of people asked for photos with you too, right?

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,640
That was completely different

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,959
Whenever I went out before

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,920
if there was any man next to me

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,120
I had to hide and sneak around

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,280
If anyone recognized me

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,840
they'd have to keep their distance

17
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,319
This is the first time in my life

18
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,480
that I can be out in public

19
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,159
without having to hide anything

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,760
and be with someone of the opposite sex

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,799
This feeling...

22
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,680
It's pure happiness

23
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,920
Let's go, you

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,439
Your leg...

25
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,760
Shanshan

26
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,319
I want to tell you

27
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,639
Meeting the wrong person at the wrong time

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,280
is helplessness

29
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,280
Meeting the right person at the wrong time

30
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,199
is regret

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,639
But meeting the right person

32
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,520
at the right time...

33
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,400
That is love

34
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,840
My time may not be much

35
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:29,879
nor long

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,919
But my love for you

37
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,639
will be long

38
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,439
My eyes see no one else

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,000
they are filled only with you

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,919
I'm willing to become the starry sky

41
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,280
always by your side

42
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,199
Whenever you need me

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,000
I will appear

44
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:45,800
Ru

45
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,759
How was it yesterday?

46
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,039
Came back right after dinner

47
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,960
Just ate?

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,439
Didn't talk about anything else?

49
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,639
We talked a bit

50
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,960
What about?

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
Just that you two got your stories straight

52
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,560
The gifts were all from me

53
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,080
And feelings?

54
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,439
A decade of unwavering comrade camaraderie

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
Lin Ru, let me tell you

56
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,800
I know you like him

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,040
I also know

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
that Jinbai actually cares about you a lot

59
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,759
If it weren't for me back then

60
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,399
you might have been together long ago

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,399
I actually knew

62
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,079
but I didn't know how to explain it to you

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,519
I know these feelings

64
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,680
were real once

65
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
I just feel it's such a pity for you two

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,120
Actually...

67
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:41,959
Shanshan

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,360
you've always been my best friend

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,759
So has Jinbai

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
So, I hope you both will be well

71
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,399
My leg...

72
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,600
So you have your day too, huh?

73
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
Why is it you?

74
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,720
Our feud is between us

75
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,519
Don't drag others into it

76
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,279
If that platform had collapsed that day

77
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,920
and actually hit someone

78
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,879
it would have been a huge problem

79
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,319
You'd face legal responsibility

80
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,839
If you keep strutting around like this

81
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,720
I will really have you arrested

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,920
That would be great

83
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,839
Let me see

84
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,120
how you'd turn against your own family

85
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,839
for a woman

86
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,839
Shanshan and I are just in a cooperative relationship

87
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,079
Using each other

88
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,000
Contract couple, get it?

89
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,800
I don't need to explain to you

90
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,120
Get out

91
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,759
I know how much you've done for her

92
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,319
You can't fool me

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,480
Shen Zhihe

94
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,279
We can fight however we want

95
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,360
but Shanshan is my bottom line

96
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,720
Don't touch her

97
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,600
So, Shen Jiaqin didn't dare get close to me before

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
didn't dare acknowledge our relationship

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,959
all because he was afraid of his brother?

100
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,839
This little brat

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,680
Needs to be taught a lesson

102
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,240
Don't forget

103
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,000
you owe me all of this

104
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,000
Shen Zhihe

105
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,360
So you're Shen Jiaqin's brother

106
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,360
That patient told you?

107
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,160
Little brat

108
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,439
I know you

109
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,480
For a younger brother

110
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,360
how exactly do you do your job?

111
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
Why is it since you were little

112
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,800
you've always caused trouble for your brother?

113
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,439
And it gets worse as you grow up

114
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,720
Whatever problems you brothers have

115
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,639
why can't you talk it out properly?

116
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,480
Do you have any idea

117
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
if that structure had fallen

118
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,639
and hit his head

119
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
he could have died?

120
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,680
He's your own brother!

121
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,720
I don't have a brother

122
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,720
Oh, right

123
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,840
He just told me you two are just...

124
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,240
that...

125
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,559
contract relationship

126
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,000
If you want to climb up, better check your target's background first

127
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,120
His assets have already been shorted by me

128
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,240
Hooking up with him...

129
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,120
you might as well hook up with me

130
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,720
Are you for real?

131
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,759
Can't you speak properly?

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,879
This is a hospital!

133
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
What's your problem, you little brat?

134
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
How dare you talk to your elder sister like that?

135
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,960
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

136
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,080
You need to be taught a lesson!

137
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,679
Stop hitting me!

138
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,679
I will teach you!

139
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,919
Why does my brother like you?

140
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,840
If... if it weren't for your brother

141
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,159
I'd have finished you off already

142
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,120
I'll end you, you hear me?

143
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,000
You'll end me?

144
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,639
You're quite the actor, aren't you?

145
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,240
You'll end me?

146
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,399
Open the door!

147
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,320
You come in here!

148
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,720
You come out!

149
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,080
You come in!

150
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,960
You come out!

151
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,480
You come in!

152
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,000
You come out!

153
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,799
I'm not coming out!

154
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,759
Open the door and come out!

155
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,720
Keep kicking

156
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,720
and I'll call security on you

157
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,639
Shen Jiaqin

158
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,080
how did you end up with a brother like this?

159
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,279
What's going on?

160
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,399
Why are there so few people today?

161
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,399
Something doesn't seem right

162
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,039
Su Su

163
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,080
Xiao Xia, go ask what's happening

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
They said the investor side

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
seems to have some problems

166
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,279
The investor?

167
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,799
Shen Jiaqin

168
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,159
What's wrong with him?

169
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,399
Apparently the hotel is being valued for acquisition

170
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,000
The investment funds might not arrive on time

171
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,320
If they don't arrive

172
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,600
the production might shut down

173
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,120
Shen Jiaqin's assets...

174
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,080
Funding a show like this

175
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,159
should be nothing for him, right?

176
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,799
I'm just afraid someone is targeting him relentlessly

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,360
Actors, rehearsal! Actors, rehearsal!

178
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,200
Let's run through the scene

179
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,679
Sis, we should head to the set

180
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,120
Put it down Stop moving it

181
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,000
Where is your person in charge?

182
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,440
What are you waiting for?

183
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,240
What's the situation?

184
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,240
Hello, are you the person in charge?

185
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,080
Sorry, everyone

186
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,480
This hotel has been reported for major violations

187
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,919
We need to inspect the entire premises

188
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,759
What's going on?

189
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,080
Looks like they've shut down the set

190
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
What about the shoot?

191
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,840
Director Chen

192
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,279
Hello, Director Chen

193
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,080
Hello

194
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,759
Hello

195
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
I am Shen Zhihe, CEO of the Shen Group

196
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,120
Our group previously discussed

197
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,440
investment matters with the production

198
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,879
But I heard you insisted on filming at H Hotel

199
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,840
so we didn't pursue further talks

200
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,200
However

201
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,480
hearing about H Hotel's situation today

202
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
I sincerely invite you

203
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:37,879
Please, get in the car first

204
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,679
to film at our subsidiary, Starlight Hotel

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Any other funding issues the production has

206
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,519
we can resolve them

207
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,919
Okay, thank you, thank you

208
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Alright, let's stay in touch

209
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,159
Okay, okay

210
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,000
Shen Zhihe!

211
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
You're taking advantage of the situation!

212
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,480
Perhaps use another term

213
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,120
You could also call this

214
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,159
rescuing someone from dire straits

215
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,120
Right?

216
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,360
Right now, Shen Jiaqin might not even be able

217
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,159
to provide the original investment funds

218
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,279
let alone cover the production's additional losses

219
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,240
I

220
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,000
am the best choice to save this production

221
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,080
I'm short on time

222
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,120
Why don't you discuss it amongst yourselves?

223
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,559
I'll consider it carefully

224
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,320
Sure thing, Director Chen

225
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,320
Thank you, Mr. Shen

226
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:28,799
I told you

227
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:30,759
if I want to

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,600
I can ruin you

229
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,720
This is the fire safety inspection notice

230
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,679
This is a notice from the

231
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,559
State Administration for Market Regulation

232
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,720
And this one is

233
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,159
the sanitation inspection notice

234
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,120
I'll read it myself

235
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,519
Anyway, the interior hotel scenes

236
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,639
probably can't be filmed

237
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
We can only coordinate outdoor locations

238
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,720
But the outdoor location application process

239
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,759
will take time

240
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,840
As long as the production

241
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,679
remains at H Hotel for filming

242
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,799
it must shut down

243
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,600
During the production shutdown

244
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,240
all employee salaries will be paid as usual

245
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:17,759
Fine

246
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,320
The losses incurred by the production

247
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,559
due to our issues

248
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,960
we will definitely compensate

249
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,360
Fine

250
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,600
Handle it quickly

251
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,720
Shen Jiaqin

252
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,879
You can't win against me

253
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
I never intended to fight you

254
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,000
I will take everything you have

255
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,919
If you want something, just tell me directly

256
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,360
I'll give it all to you

257
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,399
But some people

258
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,240
are my bottom line

259
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,840
Cannot be touched

260
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,960
Yin Shanshan

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,399
Hmm?

262
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,200
Fine
