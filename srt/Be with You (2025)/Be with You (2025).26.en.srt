1
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,960
Such a fake document.

2
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,439
Do you really think in this world

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,159
there's someone who wants nothing

4
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,520
and just manages a company for others?

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,079
Shen Jiaqin would.

6
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,840
You've been brothers for so many years.

7
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,439
Search your heart and ask yourself,

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,759
what kind of person is he really?

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,840
He stole my family!

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,880
Did he want to?

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,000
That was the previous generation's doing!

12
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,560
It was a settled fact even before he was born!

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,680
It's precisely because of this guilt he carries

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
that at school,

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,719
no matter how much you bullied him,

16
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,480
he never fought back.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,519
He helped salvage

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,480
the nearly bankrupt Shen Group for you.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,359
After putting it in order,

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,879
he returned it to you.

21
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,760
Now he's starting his own business, opening a new hotel.

22
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,319
Can't you see that?

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,840
You make it sound so good.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,079
Are you him?

25
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,120
Do you know what he thinks?

26
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,120
I do.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,280
Because I've seen it.

28
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,680
I've failed you.

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,480
But you're the only one I can rely on.

30
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,640
The Shen Group can't fall apart.

31
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,840
An older brother should look after his younger brother.

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,079
It's only right.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,840
Once the Shen Group is profitable again,

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,560
I will leave.

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,680
Could it be...

36
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,280
All these years...

37
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,240
Have I been wrongly blaming him?

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,439
Thank you for your attention and trust in our company.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,719
On behalf of the company,

40
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,719
I extend this employment contract to you.

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Eight thousand a month.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Such a fake document...

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,319
Only someone like Yin Shanshan would believe it.

44
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,080
Why don't you just wake up!

45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,319
You don't want to fight me,

46
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,520
but I still want to fight you!

47
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,520
You...

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,240
You're fine, aren't you?

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,759
Get up already!

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,840
Brother.

51
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,080
Y-yes, it's me.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,560
Shen Zhihe, I'm your...

53
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,879
I'm your brother.

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,279
Brother.

55
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,720
Doctor!

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,439
He's awake!

57
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,079
Doctor!

58
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,279
Does this taste better now?

59
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,240
I practiced for a long time.

60
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:30,800
It's good.

61
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,560
Have another sip.

62
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,839
Yes, yes.

63
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,199
I know, I know.

64
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,720
Where are you going?

65
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,920
Work, work.

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Who are you calling?

67
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,519
You're calling your wallpaper?

68
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,199
Drink the soup.

69
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,680
It's good for you.

70
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,959
So delicious.

71
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,240
It's absolutely delicious!

72
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,439
Don't make it next time.

73
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,759
I want some plum juice.

74
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,600
I'll get it for you.

75
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:02,959
Okay.

76
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:11,879
Here.

77
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:17,839
Tastes good.

78
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,360
It's normal for me to faint.

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
You don't need to worry too much about me.

80
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,319
It's this hereditary disease again.

81
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
It won't happen that fast.

82
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,839
That guy Lu Yun,

83
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,639
he often says nonsense.

84
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,279
It's fine.

85
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,959
I'm in good health.

86
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,120
You know,

87
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,120
memories can fade,

88
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,240
but...

89
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,480
the body's instincts remain.

90
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,000
I always thought

91
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,800
I loved drinking plum juice

92
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,519
because I came up with it myself

93
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,639
after my mom's near car accident.

94
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,079
But I never expected

95
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,399
that we had already

96
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,000
been drinking it together for two years.

97
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,079
We actually...

98
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,160
could have had so much more time

99
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,040
together.

100
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't be so sad.

101
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
This is a hereditary disease.

102
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,000
I won't... won't die that quickly.

103
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,959
As long as I don't use that watch,

104
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,079
I can stay with you for a long, long time.

105
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,360
But you know,

106
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,759
I really liked

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,839
how you were at the hospice ward.

108
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
I'll listen to you from now on.

109
00:07:59,519 --> 00:07:59,959
Deal.

110
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,560
To enjoy a few more years of your care,

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,600
I also need to

112
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,079
hold on and live.

113
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,600
Prerequisite being,

114
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,480
we first need to find

115
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,839
the person who's been trying to harm you.

116
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,040
Shen Zhihe.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,879
He probably won't anymore, right?

118
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,639
He's not the only one who wants to hurt you.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,160
If not him, then who?

120
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
The day the set platform collapsed,

121
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,240
he called me.

122
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,079
Said he knew what the person trying to harm you looked like.

123
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,200
He told me to shut down the hotel,

124
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,240
and then he'd tell me what they looked like.

125
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,480
So I thought he was threatening me.

126
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,120
Intimidating me.

127
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,440
So I didn't take it seriously.

128
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
The person who attacked me...

129
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:47,840
Right.

130
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,039
Finally come to beg me.

131
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,480
Talk properly to your brother.

132
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,320
I haven't settled the previous scores with you yet.

133
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,600
You step out first.

134
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,039
This is my company.

135
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,279
At least save some face for me here.

136
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,159
Please.

137
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm begging you.

138
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,159
Please.

139
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,919
Please, I'm begging you.

140
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,960
Mr. Shen, please, I beg you!

141
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,759
Just tell me,

142
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,639
who exactly is trying to kill me?

143
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,360
Didn't you always think

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it was me trying to kill her?

145
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,600
Mr. Shen,

146
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,480
you're so outstanding,

147
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,399
with assets worth billions.

148
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,879
You could crush me with a flick of your finger.

149
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,360
How could it be you wanting to kill me?

150
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,919
That's enough, I'm telling you.

151
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,039
I haven't had enough fun yet.

152
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,519
Have a seat.

153
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,399
Forgot the main business.

154
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,440
This is a list of all the media and paparazzi

155
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
I've paid off.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,320
It also includes things they've done.

157
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,159
I've looked into everything.

158
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,399
It wasn't them.

159
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,240
The person who tipped me off about the set accident

160
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,320
was Cao Wen.

161
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,679
You've done so much.

162
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,679
Wasn't it all for the two of them?

163
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,799
They are not my target.

164
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,360
Then why did you collaborate with Xu Jinbai

165
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,039
to ruin Yin Shanshan's reputation?

166
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,120
And deliberately sent someone to the set

167
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,840
to sabotage the platform?

168
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,200
Wait.

169
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Who said I arranged for the sabotage?

170
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,039
Wasn't that crew member your man?

171
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,200
He's at almost every one of Yin Shanshan's events.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,879
Besides you,

173
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,559
who else has the resources

174
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,039
to get so much information?

175
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,320
To know your schedule in such detail?

176
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,240
Could it be...?

177
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,080
Haven't you ever suspected someone close to you?

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,799
Someone close to me...

179
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,879
Why did I think

180
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,120
he was someone Shen Zhihe hired?

181
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,799
Because this person

182
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,120
shows up at all kinds of events.

183
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,279
Even some non-public appearances.

184
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,840
Logically speaking,

185
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,279
an ordinary paparazzo couldn't possibly manage that.

186
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,440
Are you even hearing yourself?

187
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,360
Have you forgotten who's been cleaning up your messes

188
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,879
all these years?

189
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,360
And you dare suspect me?

190
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,360
Only a handful of people know my schedule.

191
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,519
You're the closest to me.

192
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,159
You know the most.

193
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,080
You understand the most.

194
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,240
If it weren't for you,

195
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,240
how could the paparazzi catch me every single time?

196
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,559
Then why don't you think about

197
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,320
why you're the one with so many scandals

198
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,240
for the paparazzi to expose?

199
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,600
Who else can you blame for your own problems?

200
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
I find you're always like this.

201
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,799
Whenever there's a problem, you just blame others.

202
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,759
Never reflect on yourself.

203
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,720
Lin Ru.

204
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,000
Look clearly.

205
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,320
The evidence is conclusive.

206
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,720
Anything else to say?

207
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
Do I have to spell it out so harshly?

208
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,320
You investigated me?

209
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,399
So what if I did?

210
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:24,559
If there was nothing to find,

211
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,240
if you hadn't betrayed me,

212
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,320
would I have found anything?

213
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,159
Fine, Yin Erfeng.

214
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,960
After all these years of friendship,

215
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,519
it ends today.

216
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,720
If you tell me

217
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,799
who you sold my information to,

218
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,720
how much you sold it for,

219
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,759
our relationship

220
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,879
might still be salvageable.

221
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,399
No need.

222
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,559
Lin Ru!

223
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,600
Lin Ru!

224
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,559
Sister Ru!

225
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,480
I can't serve this diva anymore.

226
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,480
Whoever wants to serve her can go ahead.

227
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,720
Yin Shanshan,

228
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,799
let me tell you,

229
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,720
you might not want to hear this, but

230
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,600
only you

231
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,200
see yourself as a big star.

232
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,480
You think that information is so precious?

233
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,679
All these years,

234
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,679
have you ever treated the people around you as human?

235
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,639
Whoever wants this job can have it.

236
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,000
I quit.

237
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,840
You quit? Fine, get out!

238
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,320
Don't even think about coming back, I'm telling you!

239
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,200
Sister Shanshan,

240
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
don't be angry.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,279
Sister Lin Ru just said those things in the heat of the moment.

242
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Xiao Xia.

243
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,480
I treat you all like sisters.

244
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,679
Have I ever treated you badly?

245
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,080
Sis,

246
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,879
you've been so good to us.

247
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,440
You're beautiful and kind-hearted.

248
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,360
You're the best boss I've ever had.

249
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,879
Sister Lin Ru,

250
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,639
must have some difficulties.

251
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,200
When you've cooled down,

252
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,559
send her a message, meet up,

253
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,080
and talk it out. It'll be fine.

254
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,480
You reminded me.

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,039
Block her right now.

256
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,639
Don't!

257
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,480
Let her try sending me messages from now on!

258
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,159
She left the group chat first.

259
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,480
She played the victim first!

260
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,960
Unbelievable!

261
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,399
Xiao Xia,

262
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,639
from now on, you'll handle my work.

263
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,320
You're my manager now.

264
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,759
Thank you, sis! Thank you!

265
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,240
Sister Shanshan, tomorrow's schedule is out.

266
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,080
Originally, you were supposed to be in makeup at 6 AM,

267
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,240
but I was afraid you wouldn't get enough sleep,

268
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,120
so I negotiated with the coordinator for 7 AM.

269
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,360
I'll wake you up tomorrow morning.

270
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,600
See?

271
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,480
You're the one who really cares about me.

272
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,879
Lin Ru always used to tell me

273
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,639
how hard this person or that person worked,

274
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,639
asking me to understand, to compromise.

275
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,679
Why should I?

276
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,759
Why did she never consider my feelings?

277
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,960
Always taking others' side.

278
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,840
What kind of manager is that?

279
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,799
If she weren't my classmate,

280
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,279
I wouldn't have kept her around this long.

281
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,679
Always giving me attitude.

282
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Loves to lecture.

283
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,240
Nags about everything.

284
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,840
Sister Shanshan, don't be angry.

285
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,559
Sister Lin Ru was just concerned about you.

286
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,919
I don't need her concern.

287
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,240
I have you now.

288
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,279
I think you're much better than her.

289
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,320
Xiao Xia,

290
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,679
from now on,

291
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,039
you don't need to be so timid.

292
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
Now that you're my manager,

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,600
everyone has to call you

294
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,720
Sister Xia.

295
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:06,559
Sis,

296
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,080
I'm just here to serve you.

297
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,440
As long as you keep doing better,

298
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm happy.

299
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,840
Hello?

300
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,639
Let's meet tomorrow night at 7.

301
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,480
I haven't told anyone.

302
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,120
Don't you tell anyone either.

303
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,799
I'm afraid the paparazzi might see.

304
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,120
Aren't you Yin Shanshan?

305
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,320
Sister Shanshan, you can sleep in tomorrow.

306
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,879
But you might have to stay up a bit late at night.

307
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,840
If you don't want to stay up late,

308
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,960
I can talk to the crew again,

309
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,320
see if we can change the night shoot.

310
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,399
Why?

311
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,960
I just don't want you to be too tired.

312
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,120
I'm asking you why

313
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,200
did you sell my information to the paparazzi?
