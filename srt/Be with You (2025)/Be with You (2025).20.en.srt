1
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,520
So?

2
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,200
Any news from Shen Jiaqin?

3
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,640
Proceed with the shoot as scheduled

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,680
Don't worry, the investment funds will definitely be transferred...

5
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,439
Boss, your medicine

6
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,840
...on time

7
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,400
The doctor will come by for a check-up later

8
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:26,760
Mm-hmm

9
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,680
How are the arrangements for the opening ceremony going?

10
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:30,560
Good

11
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,719
Thanks

12
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,599
Boss, you're the investor,

13
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,920
not the production manager

14
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,480
Really, there's no need...

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,760
No need to go into such detail

16
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,719
Picked an auspicious date and time

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
8:08 AM

18
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,799
Main cast, let's take a photo!

19
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,120
Let's go

20
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,639
Still no word from Shen Jiaqin?

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:10,960
Mm-hmm

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,599
Don't worry, the project just started

23
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,599
It's normal to be busy

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
If you hadn't shown up,

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,719
I'd have thought you used her as a bet

26
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,639
Win and run

27
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,159
She was never a bet

28
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,680
She only belongs to herself

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,599
What are you two talking about?

30
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,800
Saying your makeup looks beautiful today

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,719
Our leading lady in the center!

32
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,840
Want to stand in the middle?

33
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,319
Where should I stand?

34
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,479
Wherever I stand is the center

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,520
Okay, everyone look here!

36
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,759
Three, two, one... A successful start to the shoot!

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,639
A successful start!

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,120
Your sunshine...

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,919
comes at the cost

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,840
of absorbing nutrients from others

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,319
That line isn't very natural, is it?

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,520
Director, I feel...

43
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,840
some of our lines

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,560
aren't very conversational

45
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,840
What do you want to do?

46
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,879
Can we find another way to say it?

47
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,400
Sure! I think using more natural language is great

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,039
As long as it expresses your inner feelings

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,680
Director!

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,879
Director!

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,639
Director, can we discuss this scene?

52
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,240
Sure!

53
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,960
Make all necessary preparations

54
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,159
All departments, ready!

55
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,360
Quiet on set!

56
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:19,920
Wen-jie

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,680
The director just told me

58
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,480
that for lines that aren't conversational,

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,800
we can change them to

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
things we'd naturally say,

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
to express the meaning

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,279
You're so kind...

63
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,560
Your happiness...

64
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,240
comes at the cost of draining others' energy?

65
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,879
If I had everything you have,

66
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,079
I could have sunshine too

67
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,079
I could be full of happiness

68
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,600
Give it all to me!

69
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,160
How was that? Do you think it worked?

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,759
Yes, it was great!

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,040
I'll... I'll match your energy

72
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,759
Okay, when we start filming later,

73
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,120
stand over there, okay?

74
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,639
Here?

75
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,800
Mm-hmm, stand here, right here

76
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,639
Director, we're ready

77
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,480
We can start

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,279
Okay, all departments ready!

79
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,600
Quiet on set!

80
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,160
And... three, two, one, action!

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,079
Your happiness...

82
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,839
comes at the cost of draining others' energy?

83
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
If I had everything you have...

84
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,399
I could be full of sunshine

85
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,000
Watch out! Be careful, Shanshan!

86
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,759
Quick, give me a hand!

87
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,120
Call an ambulance!

88
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,120
Shen Jiaqin!

89
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,600
Your leg! Don't move, don't move!

90
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,959
Call 120, quick!

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,160
Make way, make way!

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,839
My leg...

93
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,199
Make way!

94
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,040
Doctor, my leg...

95
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,279
Shanshan...

96
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,600
But we haven't finished the scene...

97
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,959
Touch up my makeup

98
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,279
The set platform collapse...

99
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,319
It must have been deliberate

100
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,160
Every single crew member on site

101
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,800
needs to be investigated

102
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:52,680
Okay

103
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,360
Shen Zhihe won't let this go

104
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,839
I know, I know

105
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,399
Can you please just focus on

106
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,439
taking care of yourself first?

107
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,639
If you end up in the hospital again,

108
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,759
I could write a book about it

109
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,399
Titled: My Sickly Yet Flirting CEO

110
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,519
Am I flirting?

111
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
My handsome and wealthy boss...

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,319
Enough

113
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,399
How are you feeling? Is this okay?

114
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Nowhere near dead

115
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,199
I'll go start the investigation then

116
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,040
You rest well

117
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,279
Don't go running around

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,199
How could I run?

119
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,920
Fooled you all, didn't I?

120
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,639
Not running? Like hell I'm not

121
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,240
My leg is perfectly fine

122
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,879
Cut! Cut, cut!

123
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,720
Is that phone booth moving?

124
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,240
No

125
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,600
It didn't move?

126
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,199
No

127
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,879
Okay, sorry Let's...

128
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,839
Let's try another take Go

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,800
Stand by

130
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,199
Action!

131
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,199
Cut, cut, cut!

132
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,279
The phone booth still didn't move?

133
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,120
No

134
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:17,920
It didn't move

135
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,800
No

136
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,439
The actors are doing great!

137
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,079
Keep up the energy

138
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,199
Give me the eye drops, come on

139
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,439
Okay, stand by

140
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,759
Camera rolling!

141
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,680
Stand by

142
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,120
Action!

143
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,399
Cut!

144
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,159
Camera, did you shake it just now?

145
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
If you didn't, why is the phone booth out of frame?

146
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,440
Ugh, this kind of scene...

147
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,840
you have to make it look real

148
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,279
You really have to use camera angles

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,960
You really have to use angles

150
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
Use camera angles for real?

151
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,240
This kind of intimate scene is shot so well!

152
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,840
Shanshan spent a lot of time

153
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,159
studying this kiss scene

154
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,679
Shen Pei

155
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,039
You do like me, don't you?

156
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,639
Excuse me

157
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,279
I think it would be better if the female lead's character

158
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,559
was more direct

159
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,000
She should just say,

160
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,440
Shen Pei, I like you

161
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,840
Excuse me

162
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,480
Is no one managing this set?

163
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,360
Is it moving?

164
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,879
Let's find a quieter place to rehearse

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,360
I feel like lately,

166
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,480
filming keeps getting interrupted

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,679
It's weird

168
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,440
Okay

169
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,840
Maybe we should rehearse tomorrow instead

170
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,200
I need to go bring Shen Jiaqin some chicken soup

171
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,080
I stewed chicken soup for him

172
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
It's been exactly eight hours

173
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,440
Okay

174
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,480
Thank you, Jinbai

175
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,720
You've even learned to make soup

176
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,360
Sir,

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,639
buying lingerie?

178
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:36,960
Yes, yes, yes

179
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,679
May I ask, is this for everyday needs,

180
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,519
or...

181
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,919
something else?

182
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,600
A hint!

183
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,759
How could this possibly be for everyday needs?

184
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,159
That's not normal

185
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,240
Absolutely not normal

186
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,120
Understood, understood

187
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,639
Take a look at this style

188
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,440
No

189
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,879
That's all wrong

190
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,679
This design...

191
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,320
No, no, no, no

192
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,679
Got it, got it

193
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,720
You want to surprise your lover, right?

194
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,039
Yes, it has to be a surprise

195
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,679
Dayu!

196
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,240
Get him all those exaggerated styles

197
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,080
from last year

198
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,559
Then how about this one?

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,320
This is the one!

200
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,200
Sir,

201
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,159
that's not allowed

202
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,720
We don't sell the mannequin

203
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
The customer is always right

204
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,320
Sir, if you really want the mannequin,

205
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,600
we can sell it to you

206
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,399
I don't want the mannequin!

207
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,559
Sorry about that

208
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,440
You don't want the mannequin?

209
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,600
Then what are you buying lingerie for?

210
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,840
Isn't this a bit too old-fashioned?

211
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,039
What young girl would like this?

212
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,440
How is that possible?

213
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,919
When I picked gifts for you before,

214
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,559
Lin Ru always praised my taste

215
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,559
She'll definitely like this one

216
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,200
But it's not so...

217
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,919
That restaurant reservation I asked you to look into,

218
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,279
any progress?

219
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,519
Boss, let me tell you...

220
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,000
Before your leg is fully healed,

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,039
you really shouldn't move around

222
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,120
Hmm

223
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,679
You said before it's healed

224
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,000
But I'm already better now

225
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,200
Recovered?

226
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,840
Let me tell you,

227
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,759
I happen to know the restaurant

228
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,399
that Xu Jinbai reserved for Yin Shanshan

229
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,000
Well?

230
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,320
Get the wheelchair

231
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,279
The electric one!

232
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,440
Shen Jiaqin, what are you doing here?

233
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Did Shanshan invite you?

234
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,799
Fine, we can celebrate together then

235
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,320
Together?

236
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,399
You sure know how to play

237
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,519
Your circle is so messy

238
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,200
You... must have some misunderstanding

239
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,039
Don't give me that cheeky grin

240
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,480
During filming, you bring roses

241
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,799
and invite my girlfriend to a place like this?

242
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,279
Have you considered my feelings?

243
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,840
You're still laughing? Look at you, grinning like an idiot

244
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,159
You... what are you all doing here?

245
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,279
Did you invite him?

246
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,679
I didn't invite him

247
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:22,840
Well...

248
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,799
Would she invite me?

249
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I invited myself

250
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,240
If I didn't come, my backyard might catch fire

251
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,000
What then?

252
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,919
If you can't keep up, I'll go by myself, okay?

253
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,039
Great, another one

254
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,879
What are you all doing here?

255
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,399
May you be blessed with happiness and health!

256
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,519
Congratulations on this happy day!

257
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,279
May all your days be as happy as this one!

258
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,200
May all your years be as bright as today!

259
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,200
Congratulations to you! Congratulations!

260
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,039
Happy Birthday!

261
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,600
What are you all doing?

262
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,519
I was so busy I forgot

263
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,960
It's been so long since I celebrated my birthday

264
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,799
I feel a year older

265
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,000
What are you talking about?

266
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,399
Out of the three of us,

267
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,600
you're the youngest!

268
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:12,840
Right!

269
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,519
My mistake

270
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,519
After graduation,

271
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,039
I never properly celebrated your birthday

272
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,440
I'll celebrate with you every year from now on

273
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,559
I'm not big on celebrating it

274
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,159
Since we have flowers,

275
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,200
do you two want to take a photo for Weibo?

276
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,759
It could easily trend twice

277
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,600
Why are you thinking about me on your birthday?

278
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,399
Think about yourself

279
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,759
It's just... you suddenly arranged

280
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,840
such a big production, I'm not used to it

281
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,519
But these flowers... are really beautiful

282
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,279
Let me tell you,

283
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,879
these flowers...

284
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,960
were specially picked for you by Jinbai
