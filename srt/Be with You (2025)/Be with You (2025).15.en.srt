1
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:40,960
Okay.

2
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,280
Thanks.

3
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:42,920
You're welcome.

4
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:44,880
Shanshan.

5
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:45,920
Fresh off the grill.

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,000
Have a bite while it's hot.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Shanshan doesn't eat bell peppers.

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,719
How do you remember I don't eat bell peppers?

9
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,679
You don't like bell peppers.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,920
But before...

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
It was only because you liked them...

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
that I always ate them with you.

13
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,519
You don't like them either?

14
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,799
Did I know you so little?

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:16,920
Hmm.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,319
I think so too.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,200
Logically, after ten years together,

18
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,560
we should be the people

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,040
who know each other best in the world.

20
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,319
But in reality...

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,079
it was just our own presumptions.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,239
You know...

23
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,239
someone who dislikes me knows me better than you do.

24
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,480
And I...

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,959
don't know you as well as Lin Ru does.

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,079
I'm so full.

27
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,680
I want to take a walk.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,840
And do some figure management.

29
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:45,959
I'll go with you.

30
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,599
I know her.

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,760
Hear that?

32
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,000
When did they get so close?

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,680
Good grilling.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,159
Grill two more.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,359
Would you like extra numbing spice and chili, sir?

36
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:04,840
Thanks.

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
You just ate.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,479
Exercising so vigorously...

39
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,800
will give you stomach cramps.

40
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:19,919
What,

41
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:20,919
I...

42
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,280
just have a strong constitution.

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,800
Jealous?

44
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,199
Being on a deserted island late at night...

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,319
alone with your rival...

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,560
Aren't you scared?

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,400
Scared of what?

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,240
Why are you so close to me?

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
Are... are you...

50
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,319
planning to harm me tonight?

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,080
I'm warning you...

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,879
Don't come any closer!

53
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,919
If you take another step, I'll scream!

54
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,639
They're so close by...

55
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,800
they'll hear me if I scream!

56
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,280
You... you... do you want...

57
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,479
a story about female stars fighting...

58
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,759
and a top star being murdered trending?

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Look how scared you are.

60
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,520
If you step back any further, you'll fall in the river.

61
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,280
Come up here.

62
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,479
Get over here.

63
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,199
You're so clumsy, day in and day out.

64
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,400
Making me worry so much about you.

65
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,560
I'm going to get wrinkles.

66
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,960
Is your dress dirty?

67
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,759
What were you doing just now?

68
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,360
Saving you! What do you think I was doing?

69
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,919
Are you messing with me?

70
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,840
I was afraid...

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,479
Are you messing with me?

72
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,879
The cameras are on us, I'm telling you!

73
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,840
Are you messing with me?

74
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,840
Stop, stop!

75
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,240
Before...

76
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,120
did you really hate me?

77
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,840
Hmm.

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
I really hated you.

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
You think I liked you?

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,639
I know you hated me too.

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,199
Doesn't that make us...

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,919
a mutual understanding?

83
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,680
Actually...

84
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
that's not true.

85
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,720
Yin Shanshan...

86
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,720
You're my idol.

87
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,279
Don't you remember?

88
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,439
You gave me my first acting opportunity.

89
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,240
Three years ago,

90
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,480
when I first joined the company,

91
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,600
I was nobody.

92
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
I was nothing.

93
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,360
Just a complete unknown.

94
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,920
Until...

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,199
I saw you.

96
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,959
In the crowd...

97
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,199
you were shining.

98
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Wow.

99
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,560
The other supporting roles for this drama are...

100
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,519
so unattractive.

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
This is an idol drama.

102
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,160
What does an idol drama need?

103
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,399
Beautiful people!

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,920
But they're just supporting roles.

105
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:07,959
So what if they're supporting roles?

106
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,079
Does that mean they can be ugly?

107
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,639
The audience is watching for me.

108
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,319
Why should they have to look at ugly people?

109
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,040
You.

110
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,399
Turn around.

111
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,879
Sister Shanshan.

112
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,399
This one's pretty.

113
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,199
Let's go with her.

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,319
Hello.

115
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,560
Hello.

116
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,759
Hello.

117
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,680
Could I get your contact info?

118
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,199
Hello.

119
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,240
Hmm?

120
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,720
Such a popular star...

121
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,279
must be someone hardworking and capable.

122
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,000
Who knew she was really such a naive airhead.

123
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,959
You're speechless now, aren't you?

124
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,519
I'm not going to compete with you...

125
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,000
for the female lead in Coming for You anymore.

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
What do you mean?

127
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,279
It was mine to begin with!

128
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,079
Why won't you compete anymore?

129
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:40,160
Because a better project came my way.

130
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,839
But...

131
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,079
lately, seeing you...

132
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,560
and your efforts for Coming for You...

133
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,120
I'm really...

134
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,079
so happy for you.

135
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,839
My former idol,

136
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,360
Yin Shanshan...

137
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,000
you've finally learned to fight for yourself.

138
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,639
You're amazing.

139
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,319
I think I...

140
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,240
have changed a bit.

141
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,319
Changed to...

142
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,000
kind of liking you.

143
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,879
Maybe we should...

144
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,959
start over.

145
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,319
Yin Shanshan.

146
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:10,759
Xia Yan.

147
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,639
Ms. Shanshan,

148
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,240
your agent just called us.

149
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,319
She said it's urgent and needs to find you.

150
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,199
She's on her way now.

151
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,480
Shall I take you to her?

152
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,480
Lin Ru?

153
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,560
What happened?

154
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,879
You should go.

155
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,600
What if it's really urgent?

156
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,439
Didn't we hand in our phones...

157
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,319
before coming to the island?

158
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,039
She couldn't reach you.

159
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,080
She must be worried sick.

160
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,120
I'll head over then.

161
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,200
Okay, go ahead.

162
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
This way.

163
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,679
Be careful.

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
It's so late.

165
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,360
Lin Ru is waiting for me in the woods.

166
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,759
Through the woods is the other pier of the island.

167
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,240
Boats can only dock there at night.

168
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,519
Going through the woods is faster.

169
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,799
I... I just remembered...

170
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,519
I think I forgot something.

171
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,120
I need to go back and get it.

172
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,960
It can't wait a little longer?

173
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll come back later.

174
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,639
It's urgent over there.

175
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm in a hurry too.

176
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,159
My... my bracelet is missing.

177
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,720
The bracelet is very important to me.

178
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,720
I can't lose it.

179
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,120
What are you doing? Let me go!

180
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,399
Let me go!

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let me show you...

182
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,240
the power of the landlord!

183
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,120
Pair of threes.

184
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,840
Pair of jacks.

185
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,399
Pair of queens.

186
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,639
Pair of aces.

187
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,879
Bomb!

188
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,919
Aren't they on the same team?

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,519
Why are they fighting each other?

190
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,559
Play.

191
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,200
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

192
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,480
Continue.

193
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,720
A three.

194
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
A six.

195
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
What's the situation now?

196
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:30,960
Game over.

197
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,919
Do you even know how to play?

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,720
So, who won?

199
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,919
Where's Shanshan?

200
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Shen Jiaqin!

201
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,679
Jinbai!

202
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,080
Shen Jiaqin!

203
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,879
Jinbai!

204
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,080
Shanshan!

205
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,320
Can you hear me, Shanshan?

206
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,799
Shanshan!

207
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,720
Shanshan!

208
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,919
Don't worry, we will find Ms. Shanshan.

209
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,519
The island is completely locked down.

210
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,600
The signal tower will be restored tomorrow,

211
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,080
and we'll notify everyone's teams.

212
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,679
Our production crew is all at the camp.

213
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,639
It's safe. Please, everyone, remain calm.

214
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,879
This arrangement is really...

215
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,000
Where are those two?

216
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,080
Did they both go looking for Shanshan?

217
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,240
Probably.

218
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,799
From now on,

219
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,519
carry this walkie-talkie with you at all times.

220
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,480
Understood?

221
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,879
Okay.

222
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,559
Help! Help!

223
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,000
Shanshan!

224
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,039
If you can hear me,

225
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,120
tell me where you are now.

226
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,120
Okay.

227
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,519
It's all trees... Where is this?

228
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,879
I... I just escaped from that creep.

229
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:15,919
Water...

230
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,440
There's water ahead.

231
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,120
I left marks...

232
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,879
Erfeng.

233
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,200
What did you leave?

234
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,120
Marks?

235
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,240
Erfeng.

236
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,480
Don't scare me, Erfeng.

237
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,320
Erfeng!

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,600
Marks...

239
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,000
Erfeng.

240
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,200
Marks...

241
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,200
She must have left marks.

242
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,279
Erfeng, hang in there.

243
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,799
I'll find you soon.

244
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,840
Hold on, don't panic.

245
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,919
Marks.

246
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:47,919
Cross...

247
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,120
Go left.

248
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:50,799
Erfeng.

249
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,080
Erfeng.

250
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,799
-Erfeng!
-Jinbai!

251
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,720
Erfeng, where are you?

252
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,840
Horizontal means back.

253
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:05,960
Erfeng.

254
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm coming, don't worry.

255
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,039
Erfeng.

256
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,759
Erfeng.

257
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,080
Erfeng.

258
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,639
Erfeng.

259
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,720
Vertical means forward.

260
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,639
Horizontal means back.

261
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
It's my little distress signal.

262
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,120
Erfeng, where are you, Erfeng?

263
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,200
Erfeng!

264
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:25,840
Erfeng!

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,159
Erfeng, where are you, Erfeng?

266
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,480
Cross means left.

267
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Plus sign means right.

268
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,080
Erfeng.

269
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,080
Can you hear me, Erfeng?

270
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,399
Jinbai.

271
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,480
You're awake.

272
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,440
It's okay, we're going back now.

273
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,960
Jinbai.

274
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,200
I knew you would find me.

275
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,759
Shen Jiaqin.

276
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,679
Hmm?

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,600
It's me.

278
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,559
I just had a dream.

280
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,240
I dreamed...

281
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,399
that I got lost during our graduation camping trip too.

282
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,440
Jinbai saved me.

283
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,799
So I just...

284
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,840
No 'so'.

285
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
As long as you're safe,

286
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,159
I'm fine with anything.

287
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,759
Sleep now.

288
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,080
We'll be there soon.

289
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,720
Boss.

290
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,600
Boss.

291
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,480
You're finally back.

292
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:54,720
I'm back.

293
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,440
Shanshan! Shanshan, are you okay?

294
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,600
Let me.

295
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,879
How are you? Are you okay?

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,639
Jinbai.

297
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,360
You're awake.

298
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:43,840
Want some hot water?

299
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,360
Was it you who found me?

300
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,000
It was Shen Jiaqin.

301
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,039
How could it be Shen Jiaqin?

302
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Jinbai.

303
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,919
Do you remember...

304
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,320
that time during our graduation camping trip?

305
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:05,720
I got lost then too.

306
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Of course I remember.

307
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,960
I was just thinking about that.

308
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,960
I found you in the woods.

309
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,120
And carried you back.

310
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,399
Where did you find me?

311
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,320
I remember it was under a big tree...

312
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,360
next to the campsite entrance.

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,960
But that's not right.

314
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
After we took the graduation photo,

315
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,759
on my way to find him

316
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,919
I accidentally fell.

317
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,919
Later, I was exhausted...

318
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,519
and passed out next to a large rock.

319
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,720
But he found me under a tree.

320
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,519
So who moved me...

321
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,120
to the tree at the campsite entrance?

322
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,039
Did you see my marks back then?

323
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,360
What marks?

324
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,720
Vertical means forward.

325
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,519
Horizontal means back.

326
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,559
Cross means left.

327
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Plus sign means right.

328
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,200
What does that mean?

329
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,000
He doesn't know my bandage distress signals.

330
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,599
So the one who used the marks to find me...

331
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,599
and moved me from the rock...

332
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,720
to under the tree was someone else.

333
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,160
Maybe I remembered wrong.

334
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,759
Has the person who attacked me been caught?

335
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,440
Not yet.

336
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,599
The production team said he was a temp worker...

337
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,799
who used a fake ID to get in.

338
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,480
But don't worry,

339
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,359
the police have been notified.

340
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,440
They'll catch him.

341
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,599
The water seems a bit cold.

342
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,240
Let me boil another pot for you.

343
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,119
Thanks.

344
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,359
Strange.

345
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
He doesn't know my bandage distress signals.

346
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,839
Then who could it be?

347
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
Could it be Shen Jiaqin?

348
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,119
Vertical means forward.

349
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,519
Horizontal means back.

350
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,359
Cross means left.

351
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:02,920
Plus sign means right.

352
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,480
Erfeng.

353
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:08,599
Erfeng.

354
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,920
Erfeng.

355
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,160
Erfeng, where are you?

356
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,119
Erfeng.

357
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,440
Erfeng.

358
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,920
Erfeng.

359
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,720
So it was Shen Jiaqin all along.
