1
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,200
Shanshan

2
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,520
Is that really necessary?

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,079
So what if we change locations?

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,479
We're just actors.

5
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,119
Let's just go along with it.

6
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:46,719
But...

7
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,799
Shen Jiaqin invested so much

8
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,719
in this project.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
Wasn't the whole point to film at his hotel

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
for promotion?

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,679
If we change locations now,

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,719
what's the point?

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
That amount is nothing to him.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,079
But it's not just about the money.

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,799
Look at you, all worried about him.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,799
Does he even care?

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,399
But I care.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,840
Director.

19
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,200
This is my entire salary for this drama.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,079
I originally planned to donate it

21
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,200
to the Hospice Ward after filming wrapped.

22
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,719
But right now,

23
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,200
we need to keep filming

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,200
to raise awareness for terminal illnesses,

25
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,719
for the final chapters of seriously ill patients' lives.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,959
If we stop filming now,

27
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:30,799
who knows when we'll resume.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,400
Over two hundred crew members are waiting.

29
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,159
Besides my pursuit of art,

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm responsible for them too.

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,000
No, Director,

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,560
you misunderstand.

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,120
I'm not asking you to stay here

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
and wait for filming to resume.

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,879
I wanted to discuss with you

36
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,079
if we could possibly use this time

37
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,159
without delaying the crew's schedule,

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,000
to also help promote

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,840
the Hospice Ward.

40
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,959
It's not just for this drama.

41
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,680
I don't know if the other actors

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,919
would be willing.

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,479
Hello everyone, I'm Lu Jin.

44
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,360
My life set sail in this hotel,

45
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,800
and it will also come to an end here.

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Coming for You

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
documents my life's story.

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,240
But in this world,

49
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,159
there are countless others like me

50
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,000
whose stories go untold.

51
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,039
This time, our crew

52
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,919
has organized a special meet-up.

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
Let's all go together to meet

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,960
people like me.

55
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,960
I hope we get the chance

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,240
to understand their lives

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,039
more deeply.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
Hello, Director.

59
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,400
President Shen.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,719
Our crew plans to

61
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,039
shoot other scenes first.

62
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,360
Can we move into the hotel set in a week?

63
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
One week?

64
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,080
Fine.

65
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,199
It's enough, enough.

66
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,800
Mr. Shen! Mr. Shen!

67
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,960
Mr. Shen!

68
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,919
Director Chen had already agreed to change locations,

69
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,479
but...

70
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,000
Yin Shanshan's video pushed Hotel H

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,960
to the top of trending searches.

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,240
After weighing the options, the crew

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,960
decided to stay and film at Hotel H.

74
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,560
President Shen.

75
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,279
Who let you come?

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,319
I'm here to see Mr. Shen

77
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,959
because we share a common goal.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,560
Shen Jiaqin and Yin Shanshan...

79
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,680
You've done so much.

80
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,399
Wasn't it all for the two of them?

81
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,959
They are not my goal.

82
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
Alright everyone, hurry up!

83
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,240
Come on, we're losing the light!

84
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,160
Everyone, move faster!

85
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,079
Positions, everyone!

86
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,680
With the help of concerned netizens,

87
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,759
our movie

88
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,600
has finally resumed filming at Hotel H.

89
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,040
Thank you.

90
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,680
Did the sun rise from the west?

91
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,279
Why are you thanking me?

92
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,120
Seriously.

93
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,680
You introduced me to the Hospice Ward.

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,399
I saw a different side of you there.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,480
I guess it's karma.

96
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,759
Karma?

97
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,839
You know Shen Zhihe, right?

98
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,360
We've been entangled since we were kids.

99
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,560
What kind of brothers

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,000
are as love-hate as you two?

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,480
No love.

102
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,800
Just hate.

103
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,680
And it will continue.

104
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Because I owe him.

105
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,839
Actually, many of your misfortunes

106
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,240
happened because of me.

107
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,240
Whenever we get close,

108
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,639
you encounter all sorts of problems.

109
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,920
Even death.

110
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,040
He's just a brat.

111
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,360
He doesn't have the guts.

112
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,959
I'm not joking.

113
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,399
So this is

114
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,160
the reason you've been avoiding me, right?

115
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
I just wanted to be sure.

116
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,040
Actually,

117
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,920
whether this hotel is yours or not,

118
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,639
whether you invested in this drama or not,

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
it wouldn't really affect my work.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,800
It's just that...

121
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,079
I didn't want your efforts to go to waste.

122
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,959
Lately,

123
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,800
I feel like I've gotten to know a different side of you.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,279
I've seen how hard you work,

125
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,000
and I've seen your kindness.

126
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,639
So,

127
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,279
I wanted to protect what you've worked so hard for.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,399
I might not fully understand the danger you mentioned,

129
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,800
but no matter what happens in the future,

130
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,720
I want to stand by your side.

131
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,399
I want to face it together with you.

132
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,319
Thank you.

133
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,680
Ms. Yin, what's wrong?

134
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,680
Yin Shanshan!

135
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,600
Why is my life so hard?

136
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,560
You are my only daughter!

137
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,879
And now I don't even know anything

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,480
about my own daughter's relationship status!

139
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,319
Telling me to look it up online...

140
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
The information online is half-true, half-false!

141
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,160
How am I supposed to tell what's real?

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,480
I waited and hoped...

143
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,279
I just hoped that

144
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,839
my own daughter

145
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,480
would honestly tell me the truth herself!

146
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,360
Ms. Yin.

147
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,759
I already told you,

148
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,360
we're contract partners!

149
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,040
Contract partners?

150
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,079
Yet you were hugging him so tightly in private!

151
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,240
Director Chen sent me the photos!

152
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,519
Photos?

153
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,519
What photos?

154
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,440
Director Chen?

155
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,399
How did you get in touch with him?

156
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,039
Ms. Yin,

157
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,320
please don't target everyone around me.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,679
Coming!

159
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,159
Coming, coming!

160
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,000
Wait a second!

161
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,399
Hold on!

162
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,320
Who is it?

163
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,080
Ms. Yin,

164
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,960
my daughter's back!

165
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,080
Auntie, hello.

166
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,480
Why does he look so familiar?

167
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,159
Shen Jiaqin!

168
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,399
I... I bought you some navels.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,840
You can juice them.

170
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,360
But don't drink too much,

171
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,399
they're very sweet.

172
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,720
Oh, thank you so much!

173
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,080
Good, good!

174
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,840
I knew this young man was the best!

175
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,440
Your mom tells every guy

176
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,480
he's the best.

177
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:18,879
My mom, she's just...

178
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,759
No need to explain.

179
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,120
Just don't pick up her habits.

180
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,200
Today,

181
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,279
I'll make three dishes for you.

182
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,720
Dongpo Pork,

183
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,799
Lion's Head Meatballs,

184
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,799
and Grilled Lamb Chops.

185
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,039
I'll do it.

186
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,639
Your daughter told me

187
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:33,559
I...

188
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,360
Did you tell him I can't cook?

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,120
I didn't tell him that!

190
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,799
Then how does he know?

191
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,799
Did I say it?

192
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,639
When did I say that?

193
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,559
Last time! I met him before.

194
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,240
I just thought he was tall...

195
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,279
Green Pepper Stir-fry.

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,080
They're all my favorites.

197
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
You made all of them?

198
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,720
Eat, go on, eat.

199
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,639
How did you know I love these dishes?

200
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,000
Shanshan told me all about them.

201
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,200
She went into great detail.

202
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,399
Right?

203
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,200
This guy...

204
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,960
Just what else has he done using that watch?

205
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,200
He even knows my mom's preferences

206
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,360
inside and out.

207
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,399
Auntie, try that one too,

208
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,200
see how you like it.

209
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,159
See if it passes muster.

210
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,639
It's not just passing,

211
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,720
it's perfect!

212
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,519
You should teach our Shanshan how to make these later.

213
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,639
Absolutely not.

214
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
If I teach her,

215
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,080
she won't need me anymore.

216
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,320
I'll cook for her every day from now on.

217
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,240
Good, good!

218
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,399
Eat, go on, eat!

219
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:48,919
Let's eat, eat.

220
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,080
Aren't you overacting a bit?

221
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,639
Auntie, I swear everything I just said is true.

222
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:00,000
I really like Yin Shanshan.

223
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,720
Good.

224
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,519
Then I give you two my blessing.

225
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,759
Let's eat.

226
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,039
Let's eat.

227
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,720
Me...

228
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,519
How did I give birth to such a lazy daughter?

229
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,039
You haven't moved since you got back.

230
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,279
So what? I take after you.

231
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,399
My beauty

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,120
is inherited from you too.

233
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,919
Someone as beautiful as us,

234
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,480
if we were good at everything,

235
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,600
wouldn't that be letting them off too easy?

236
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,440
You...

237
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,360
You only inherited my looks.

238
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,600
But, your taste in men...

239
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,759
does take after me.

240
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,039
Just like your father.

241
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,159
Always noticing what needs to be done.

242
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,600
He never stopped.

243
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,159
Even that Green Pepper Stir-fry...

244
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,440
tastes just like his.

245
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:52,720
Mom.

246
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,720
You're all grown up,

247
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,960
but still acting like a child.

248
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,720
Shanshan,

249
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,559
when you two

250
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,799
are more settled,

251
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,960
you should go visit your dad.

252
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,879
I know.

253
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,159
Ms. Yin,

254
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,519
all these years,

255
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,440
it's been this old man today,

256
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,919
that uncle tomorrow.

257
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,759
But you still

258
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,240
can't forget my dad.

259
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,879
Are you truly devoted,

260
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
or just fickle?

261
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:19,879
What?

262
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,519
Everyone has the right to appreciate beauty

263
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,559
and to love.

264
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,039
So what if I'm a widow?

265
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,440
Is being a widow wrong?

266
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,039
Then all these years,

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,919
why haven't you settled down with anyone?

268
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,679
Once you've met someone

269
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,840
truly wonderful,

270
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,399
afterwards,

271
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,039
you compare everyone else to them.

272
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,159
So I kept looking,

273
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,559
searching endlessly.

274
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
None were quite right.

275
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,480
Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss.

276
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,759
But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.

277
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,679
Since when do you use such flowery language?

278
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,720
Did some old man teach you that?

279
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,639
No.

280
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,440
Really?

281
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,320
It wasn't Director Chen, was it?

282
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,000
No.

283
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,159
Of course not.

284
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,159
Please don't go after people around me too.

285
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,240
I just admire him.

286
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,600
Ms. Yin, I don't want to trend online again.

287
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,320
Shanshan, this time,

288
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,720
can we really escape fate?

289
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,919
Well, I'll be darned.

290
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,960
Your cooking is actually really good.

291
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,039
Especially that...

292
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,240
You don't need to make such a big deal out of it.

293
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,080
I do.

294
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,919
I'm fine now, right?

295
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,639
It's broad daylight,

296
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,519
and right outside our house.

297
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,120
What could Shen Zhihe possibly do?

298
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,919
And besides, you said yourself

299
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,600
that the person who attacked me last time,

300
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,399
you already had him charged with defamation

301
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,360
and sent to jail.

302
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,559
So Shen Zhihe

303
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,639
probably won't try anything else.

304
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,240
I don't trust him.

305
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,519
Shen Jiaqin.

306
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,919
Have you had a crush on me for a long time?

307
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,159
I never told you

308
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,039
what my mom likes.

309
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,320
How do you know everything?

310
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,679
Those are memories from before.

311
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,600
Thank you for saving my life.

312
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,039
For helping me become who I am today.

313
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,240
Shen Jiaqin,

314
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:29,879
I like you.

315
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,480
I love you.

316
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,519
I did save your life,

317
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,720
but at the same time,

318
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,440
I almost ruined it.
