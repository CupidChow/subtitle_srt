1
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,240
Shanshan,

2
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,679
I didn't expect you to convince the film crew

3
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,759
to let you and Xia Yan compete for the female lead.

4
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,079
Susu.

5
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:54,960
Shanshan,

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,799
did you really do something out of line?

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,079
Am I that kind of person?

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,479
Alright, if there's nothing else, go back.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,200
Yin Shanshan,

10
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,840
if you get your head stuck,

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,599
I'm not responsible.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,599
Mr. Shen,

13
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,079
you're such a big man.

14
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,040
Don't hold it against me.

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,680
I was drunk yesterday.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,439
Please help me talk to the crew

17
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,920
to give me another chance.

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,159
Please, please, please.

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,840
If you don't help me now,

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,760
you'll be committing murder.

21
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,280
Come on, squeeze me to death.

22
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:27,959
No.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,159
You're starting to play the shameless game.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,799
Do you really want to join this project?

25
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,359
I knew

26
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,359
you wouldn't leave me alone.

27
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,439
What's wrong?

28
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:45,879
Are you shy?

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,040
No.

30
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,120
Are you moved?

31
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,280
No.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,400
If you're not moved,

33
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,959
why can't you look at me?

34
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,879
I'm looking at the light.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,799
Mr. Shen,

36
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,200
you invested in this movie.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,359
You must have read the script.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
What I just acted

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,640
was the scene where the female lead

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,599
forces the male lead to express his love.

41
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,599
How was it? Was I good?

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,280
You played me?

43
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,560
I'm just a regular investor.

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,199
I don't understand plays.

45
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,759
But you can ask the crew

46
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,080
to give me another chance.

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,560
Leave the professional stuff to the pros.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,439
If you want to prove your acting skills,

49
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,400
go to Director Chen.

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,000
I can only help you

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,159
to participate in tonight's...

52
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,159
I'll get ready now.

53
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,719
live broadcast.

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,759
What's wrong with you these days?

55
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,120
Why do you always do

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,000
such impulsive things?

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,759
Everyone is looking forward to

58
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,520
the competition between you and Xia Yan.

59
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,719
If you lose,

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,319
not only the play Coming to You,

61
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,879
but also your position

62
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,800
will be taken by Xia Yan.

63
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,360
Come on.

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,639
I'm the national sister,

65
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,879
Yin Shanshan,

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,319
are you secretly in love with me?

67
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,759
Shen Pei,

68
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,159
I don't care if you like me or not,

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,680
but I want you to know

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,360
that I love you.

71
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,639
No,

72
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,919
I should hate you.

73
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,919
I should hate your father.

74
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,360
But now,

75
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,879
I can't help

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,039
falling in love with you.

77
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,000
What a performance.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,560
Shen Pei.

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,159
Good thing she has many fans.

80
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,599
I love you.

81
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,560
Wow.

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,360
Shanshan's performance just now was really moving.

83
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,680
There are five seconds left before our voting ends.

84
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,680
Five.

85
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
Four.

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,159
Three.

87
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,159
Two.

88
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,159
One.

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,800
Congratulations to Yin Shanshan,

90
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,039
the heroine of Coming to You selected by the public.

91
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,039
Shanshan.

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,280
I won, I won, I won.

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,919
I won.

94
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you, director.

95
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,759
I will definitely work hard.

96
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:22,959
Thank you, director.

97
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,240
In the past few years,

98
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,720
everyone thought I was just a pretty face.

99
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
But from today on,

100
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,879
as the Lu Jin chosen by everyone,

101
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,279
I will definitely work hard

102
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,399
and hone my acting skills.

103
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,839
I will prove with my acting

104
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,439
that I am the good actress, Yin Shanshan.

105
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,439
Shen Jiaqin,

106
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,879
I won't let you get everything you want.

107
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,720
I know what you said.

108
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,480
Thank you, Director Chen.

109
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,519
See you next time.

110
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,240
Bye.

111
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:14,920
Wait.

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,199
The more you protect someone,

113
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,720
the more I'll mess with them.

114
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,639
I'm telling you,

115
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,800
stay away from her.

116
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,959
Did you hear that?

117
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,720
You love that female star so much,

118
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm going to mess with her.

119
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
What are you going to do about it?

120
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,680
Are you crazy?

121
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,319
I'll make you pay double

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
for the pain I've suffered.

123
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,639
Watch out.

124
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,560
Shen Jiaqin.

125
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,319
Shen Jiaqin.

126
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,600
Shen Jiaqin.

127
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,079
Shen Jiaqin.

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,720
Shen Jiaqin.

129
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,879
Shen Jiaqin, hold on!

130
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,120
Hold on!

131
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,079
Hold on!

132
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,680
Are you okay?

133
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,240
I'm fine.

134
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,720
Why did you change your clothes so fast?

135
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,319
The movie has started.

136
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,959
Director.

137
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,399
Director, stop for a moment.

138
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,839
Which scene are we filming now?

139
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,480
What's wrong with you?

140
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,920
What movie?

141
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,160
Am I drunk again?

142
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,759
I blacked out again?

143
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,399
No.

144
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,600
Where is this?

145
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,199
This is...

146
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,399
Near our school.

147
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,839
This is near my high school.

148
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,079
Why are you taking me here?

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,639
I didn't take you here.

150
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,800
You snuck out during

151
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,120
evening self-study to buy food.

152
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,360
I ran into you.

153
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Shen Jiaqin,

154
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,040
do you think you look like a high school student?

155
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,959
Something's not right.

156
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,000
Something's not right.

157
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,959
His attitude suddenly changed.

158
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,040
Is he going to confess?

159
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,920
Why don't you two go to evening self-study?

160
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,759
Run.

161
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,000
What are you running for?

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,199
Are you sneaking off to date?

163
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,720
See you at Anning Hospital during the break.

164
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm talking to you. Come back for evening study.

165
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,000
Director,

166
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,800
where are you?

167
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,320
[September 2015]

168
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,240
Lin Ru,

169
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,639
You're here to be an extra?

170
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,919
What's going on?

171
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,519
Wasn't I working at a hotel before?

172
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,399
Stand in line.

173
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,559
Yin Erfeng, you're too brazen.

174
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,720
Mr. Zhang,

175
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,399
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,320
Jiang Lu, Ruan Zhao, Wang Tingting.

177
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,279
Sir, class is over.

178
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,559
Can we go now?

179
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,039
Each of you write a self-criticism tomorrow.

180
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:01,919
Go.

181
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,240
They are my classmates in high school.

182
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,080
No way.

183
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,240
Am I in a different time?

184
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,879
Lin Ru.

185
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,679
What year is it now?

186
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,240
September 28, 2015.

187
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,559
What's wrong?

188
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,519
2015?

189
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
It's been ten years.

190
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,240
Give me a pinch.

191
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,440
You...

192
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,080
Yin Erfeng.

193
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,200
What?

194
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,480
Does it hurt?

195
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,720
Yes.

196
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,480
It hurts so much.

197
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,519
He Huihui,

198
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,879
my monitor.

199
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,240
You used to borrow novels from me.

200
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,080
Here.

201
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,720
Meet You Through Time and Space.

202
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,720
You just lent it to me yesterday.

203
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,720
It's for you.

204
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,159
You, you, you...

205
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,519
Dumbhead.

206
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,519
You've been writing me love letters,

207
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,320
sending me gifts, and confessing to me

208
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,240
since the first year of high school.

209
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,879
Don't exploit my love for you.

210
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,679
to be so outrageous.

211
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,399
Er Feng,

212
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,679
what's wrong with you?

213
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,039
Lin Ru,

214
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,799
how can I wake up

215
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,080
from this dream?

216
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,840
I only know that if we don't go back to the dorm,

217
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,080
we'll lose more points.

218
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
You're my agent.

219
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,480
Yin Erfeng, let's go.

220
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,559
Our boss is Bald Zhang.

221
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,000
Wait a minute.

222
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,879
Hurry up.

223
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,039
Wait for me.

224
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,639
Wait for me.

225
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,000
Yin Erfeng.

226
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,519
Lin Ru.

227
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,039
Do you know someone named Shen Jiaqin?

228
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,799
What? What's the name?

229
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,200
Who is he?

230
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,000
He's a sophomore

231
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,639
in our school.

232
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,279
He is...

233
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,080
Well, he's

234
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,519
tall,

235
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,399
with dark skin,

236
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,039
a square face,

237
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,200
and a big head.

238
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,320
I definitely don't know him.

239
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,200
Why?

240
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,360
Yin Erfeng,

241
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,840
what's going on with you?

242
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,639
You've been acting strange all day.

243
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,879
What do you want to talk about?

244
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,080
Don't be too surprised

245
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:48,879
by what I'm about to say,

246
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
and keep it a secret.

247
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,080
What is it?

248
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I swear,

249
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,919
I'm from the year 2025.

250
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,559
I'm 27 years old.

251
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,840
I'm a very popular female star.

252
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,679
I just got the lead role in a movie

253
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,519
through a live election.

254
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,399
So this is the plot of your novel.

255
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,519
Not bad.

256
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,440
This time there's a time loop

257
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,399
and time travel.

258
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,320
Impressive.

259
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,559
I've already sworn to you,

260
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,320
this isn't from a novel,

261
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,919
it's my real life experience.

262
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,639
So what's the plot that's got you stuck?

263
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
How do I get back?

264
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,840
Right, how do I get back?

265
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,720
How can I go back?

266
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,960
How can I go back?

267
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,840
How can I go back?

268
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,080
Come on.

269
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:44,960
It's midnight.

270
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,679
Speak clearly.

271
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,519
Don't be like this, okay?

272
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,480
Think about it.

273
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
In the story you wrote,

274
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,399
the time when you were no longer killed in the loop,

275
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,960
what did you do?

276
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,360
Do you like me?

277
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,519
Secret crush.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,120
Then think again.

279
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,440
When you broke free from the loop,

280
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,960
what did you do?

281
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,919
How can I fulfill your wish?

282
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,279
What? What?

283
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,720
What?

284
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,200
Isn't this the story of love and obsession?

285
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,480
You forgot a boy who had a crush on you.

286
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,919
So you fell into the confusion of time

287
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,039
to find the truth.

288
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,360
Then I...

289
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
For my heroine,

290
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,120
for going back,

291
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,960
Shen Jiaqin, I'll try my best.

292
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,480
The lights in the dormitory are about to go out.

293
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Hurry up and go back.

294
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,360
Hurry up.

295
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,240
Shen Jiaqin,

296
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,120
I finally found you.

297
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,279
What are you doing here?

298
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,240
I asked Lin Ru and the others,

299
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,279
they all said they don't know you.

300
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,399
I've been looking for you for a long time.

301
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,159
Come with me.

302
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,000
I have something to tell you.

303
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:27,960
Shen Jiaqin,

304
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,639
you have a girl looking for you?

305
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
You even protect her.

306
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,639
What do you mean?

307
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,639
Let's go.

308
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,519
I'm helping my classmate.

309
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,799
I'm afraid he has nothing to read

310
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,600
outside.

311
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
I'm afraid you have nothing to read.

312
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,919
You were so timid before.

313
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,600
trying to be a hero now?

314
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,759
[This guy looks familiar.]

315
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,159
I'll make you pay double.

316
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,159
[It's him.]

317
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,879
[They didn't get along in high school.]

318
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,559
[Could that accident...]

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,600
Shen Jiaqin,

320
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,679
you really have people looking out for you everywhere.

321
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,200
The director is here.

322
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,919
Hurry up, sit down.

323
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:20,840
Hello, director.

324
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,320
What's the matter?

325
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,960
I went to get teaching aids for the teacher.

326
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,320
I passed this classroom.

327
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,399
I saw

328
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,639
they were bullying classmates.

329
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,559
Is this the kind of school we are?

330
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,159
I thought

331
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,039
our director is so upright

332
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,360
that he would never allow

333
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,960
such things to happen in our school.

334
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,639
So,

335
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
I stepped in

336
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,919
and helped.

337
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,159
I stepped in to stop it.

338
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,519
As a result,

339
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,919
this boy

340
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,679
stood up.

341
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,480
He just took this book

342
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,480
and started smashing it on my head.

343
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,039
Then I told him

344
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,039
I would call the director over.

345
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,480
Guess what they said.

346
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,079
They said

347
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,519
the director was nothing.

348
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:19,759
I...

349
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,160
Do you have any discipline at all?

350
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,559
How dare you bully your classmates?

351
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,559
And you even bully girls.

352
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,960
Call your parents here tomorrow.

353
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,839
And him.

354
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,759
He, he, he.

355
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,759
You all call your parents.

356
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,640
I feel dizzy.

357
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,920
I was hit just now.

358
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,759
I seem to have a concussion.

359
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,880
Then go to the school infirmary.

360
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,960
No.

361
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,359
I'm too dizzy

362
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,559
to walk by myself.

363
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,359
What are you waiting for?

364
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,119
Take her there.

365
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:06,799
Okay.

366
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,200
Go.

367
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,319
Goodbye, sir.

368
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,240
Go.

369
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,400
Go check on her.

370
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,039
I can't take it anymore.

371
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm so dizzy.

372
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,559
I feel terrible.

373
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,319
Stay here.

374
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,079
I'll go get the teacher.

375
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,599
Were you this clumsy in high school?

376
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,119
I wasn't even touched.

377
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,200
Why do you go to find the teacher?

378
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,160
Go and close the door.

379
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,279
Are you crazy?

380
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,000
Then why are you here?

381
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,279
Because

382
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,519
I want to stay alone with you.

383
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,880
The director doesn't allow puppy love.

384
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:01,920
No, no.

385
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:02,920
No.

386
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,640
What are you thinking about?

387
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,839
I have something serious to tell you.

388
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:12,960
I'm thinking

389
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,960
if I tell him I'm from the future,

390
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,319
I need to kiss him to go back,

391
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,440
it seems even stranger.

392
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,799
Never mind,

393
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:24,680
I'll just give it a try.
