1
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,679
The one who should have suffered all this was supposed to be you.

2
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,679
Isn't it just because someone gave you a boost?

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,560
Letting you escape,

4
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,560
making someone else bear it.

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
You know about the watch.

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,560
Or maybe you don't.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,079
I also touched that watch by accident once.

8
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,000
So in this world,

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,799
only the two of you are the main characters.

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,520
The rest of us are just extras.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,719
You casually manipulate and change my life.

12
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,280
But...why?

13
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,760
I'm a person too, Yin Shanshan!

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,040
Shen Jiaqin

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,359
was just helping me out of a tough spot.

16
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,480
He never changed anyone else's life!

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,920
What are you doing?

18
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,640
Cao Wen, what are you doing!

19
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,120
Cao Wen, let me out! Cao Wen!

20
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,079
Now it's just the two of us.

21
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,480
Let me out!

22
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,000
Let me out!

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,040
What a beautiful face.

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,200
They say you're the new hope of the film industry.

25
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,959
But initially, they praised me like that too.

26
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,480
Ten years ago,

27
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,959
the one who should have been assaulted by that pervert was you.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
If you love me,

29
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,680
I'll wait for you to find me.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,719
I love you.

31
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,040
Love you.

32
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,599
But because Shen Jiaqin used time,

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,159
he reversed it for you.

34
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,800
Which led that pervert to target me instead.

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,159
If you love me,

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,360
I'll wait for you to find me.

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
I love you.

38
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,520
Love you.

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,199
You are mine.

40
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,560
Mine.

41
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,120
I will definitely find you.

42
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,759
My body and soul were torn apart.

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
It's the butterfly effect.

44
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,199
My life changed,

45
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,960
so other people's paths changed too.

46
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,960
How dare you say

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,840
you haven't messed with

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,199
other people's lives?

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,639
But you went through the same thing,

50
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,840
and you survived.

51
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,000
Because I didn't fight back.

52
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,919
But why didn't you fight back?

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,800
Why didn't you go to the police?

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,599
There are so many of them.

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,599
Go ask every single one of them why they didn't report it.

56
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,479
We just want to live our lives.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,639
We don't want to be haunted by these filthy memories

58
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,840
for the rest of our lives.

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
We don't want anyone to use these things

60
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,199
to point fingers at us whenever they want.

61
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,800
But the more you retreat,

62
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,599
the more he'll press forward.

63
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,360
You pretend nothing happened,

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,319
but he still didn't let you go.

65
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,000
He said he would show these to my mom.

66
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,719
I didn't get the female lead in that drama,

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,919
and my mom was already furious.

68
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,560
All of this is because of you.

69
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,960
You took everything from me.

70
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,039
What right do you have

71
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,719
to judge me from your high horse?

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
If you hate me so much,

73
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
why did you pretend to help me,

74
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,159
giving me so much information?

75
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,039
You didn't actually think I was helping you, did you?

76
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
I just wanted you to investigate

77
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,199
the people around you.

78
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,639
I wanted you to see how many people

79
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,719
actually despise you.

80
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,280
Help!

81
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,199
Are you okay?

82
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,759
Don't be impulsive.

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,120
In this world,

84
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,279
no one cares about a useless person like me.

85
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,279
Someone cares about you.

86
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,319
Think about Luo Keke.

87
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,040
I truly like you.

88
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,399
I can wait.

89
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,079
I have plenty of time

90
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,360
to prove my worth to you.

91
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,959
Why not give yourself

92
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,519
and him a chance too?

93
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,319
Behave yourself.

94
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,279
Let's go.

95
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,839
Yin Shanshan belongs to me.

96
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,160
Go.

97
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,959
She belongs only to me.

98
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,680
I just want her to be mine forever.

99
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,759
I did nothing wrong! You can't arrest me!

100
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,759
I'm not wrong!

101
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,079
You can't arrest me!

102
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,240
Shen Jiaqin.

103
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
If from the very beginning,

104
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,399
we had never discovered

105
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,240
the watch's power... that would have been better.

106
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,279
Then I would have failed the audition.

107
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,160
I wouldn't have become an actress.

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,079
I might just have been...

109
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,560
a doctor's wife.

110
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,360
What are you thinking about?

111
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,240
First of all,

112
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,959
I definitely wouldn't have become a doctor.

113
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
Besides, aren't you doing great now?

114
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,240
Pursuing the career you love most,

115
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,680
being an actress.

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,560
And you can still be a CEO's wife.

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,680
That means being my wife.

118
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,160
And the most important thing,

119
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
you still have your mother by your side.

120
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,040
But all of this...

121
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,040
was bought with other people's lives.

122
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,319
Auntie.

123
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Can I go say a word to her?

124
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,800
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,600
I want to ask you a question.

126
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,079
Go ahead.

127
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,240
You told Shen Zhihe about what happened on set...

128
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,639
just to make me realize

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
how much everyone around me hates me.

130
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,480
Is that true?

131
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,480
Your sunshine...

132
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,199
comes at the cost of draining others, doesn't it?

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,920
Even if I had everything you have,

134
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,360
I could never possess that sunshine.

135
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,399
Shanshan.

136
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,000
I hope you can...

137
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,879
stay happy forever.

138
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Actually, Cao Wen

139
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,480
was always my goal.

140
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,680
Her acting is superb.

141
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,240
It's just that her becoming like this...

142
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,480
it's all because of me.

143
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,679
What does it have to do with you?

144
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,159
Don't think like that.

145
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,759
Even without the watch,

146
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,960
if you had failed the audition,

147
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,320
she would still have been the female lead.

148
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,240
She was just better than you.

149
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,919
If you must blame someone,

150
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,879
blame those

151
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,200
who did the bad things.

152
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,679
If you must

153
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,080
think someone did wrong,

154
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,159
it's actually me.

155
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,679
It's my love for you

156
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,159
that's too obsessive.

157
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,519
In the future, the two of us will definitely be very happy.

158
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,279
Let me ask you a question.

159
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,399
Would you be willing to go back to

160
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,080
the time before the watch intervened?

161
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,000
Hold my shoulder.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,679
What are you doing?

163
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,039
Late for class and climbing the wall?

164
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,519
Just skipped class, didn't you?

165
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:10,960
Run!

166
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,320
You two!

167
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,039
Get back here!

168
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,440
Come back!

169
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,080
Run faster!

170
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,679
Go! Go!

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,679
Hurry!

172
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,679
Go, go, go!

173
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,440
Faster!

174
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,120
Stop right there!

175
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,879
My leg cramped!

176
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
Which class are you from?

177
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,919
I'm giving you a demerit!

178
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,799
Get down! Get down!

179
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,879
Come down here!

180
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,600
Principal!

181
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,759
You're still the principal after all these years?

182
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,399
Shanshan?

183
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,080
Yin Shanshan!

184
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,200
You're a big star now!

185
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,279
My daughter loves your dramas!

186
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,759
I don't have my notebook.

187
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,759
J-just sign my back, okay?

188
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,279
Oh, I...

189
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,519
Sign it, sign it!

190
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,440
Just sign my back!

191
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,600
Boss!

192
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,639
One order of takoyaki, please.

193
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,039
Okay, just a moment.

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
You eat this so often,

195
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,159
you might as well buy a food truck.

196
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,639
Then I could make it for you anytime, anywhere.

197
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,759
That's not easy.

198
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,879
You need to put love into it to make it tasty.

199
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Every single piece is made with love.

200
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,200
Each piece is filled with love for you all.

201
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,480
Here, try some.

202
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
Thanks.

203
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't be shy, don't be shy.

204
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,480
We were all young once.

205
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,960
I-I'll go get another ice cream.

206
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,240
See?

207
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,200
The more you tease her, the shyer she gets.

208
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,440
Two ice creams, please.

209
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay.

210
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,559
What's up, sir?

211
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,320
What happened?

212
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,360
Shen Jiaqin!

213
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,320
Shen Jiaqin!

214
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
Let's go, next.

215
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,039
Okay.

216
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,960
Miss Yin.

217
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,799
You've been here all night.

218
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,360
Go get some rest.

219
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,360
It's just that...

220
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,919
He told me not to say.

221
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
There's no time left.

222
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,480
He only has...

223
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,600
less than a month.

224
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,120
Why didn't anyone tell me?

225
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,000
Why did you lie to me?

226
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,279
Why was I kept in the dark?

227
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,120
Why isn't he getting proper treatment?

228
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,120
There's no other way.

229
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,559
Miss Yin,

230
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,080
we...

231
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,440
we've searched everywhere.

232
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,879
This can't be reversed.

233
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,960
That's why Boss chose to keep it from you.

234
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,679
He just wanted to

235
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,559
spend his last days happily with you.

236
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,919
I can find a better doctor.

237
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,480
I can save him.

238
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,440
Miss Yin.

239
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,480
You and Boss have been

240
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,200
staying in these loops for so long now.

241
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,519
You must have encountered all sorts of things.

242
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,720
I think

243
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,320
you should know

244
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,279
that in this world,

245
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,960
life and death are things we cannot control.

246
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,200
But I can't accept it.

247
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,320
Just yesterday he was energetic.

248
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,360
He decided to hide it from you

249
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,320
because

250
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,440
your grief would only make him suffer more.

251
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,919
I, I think

252
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
what we need to do now

253
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,720
is to

254
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,679
be happy

255
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,440
while he is still...

256
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,080
doing okay, right?

257
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,480
Shanshan, dear.

258
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,279
You should rest.

259
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,759
You have filming tomorrow.

260
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,440
So salty.

261
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,159
Your tears are salty too.

262
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,639
Do you know why Mom

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,679
could never learn to cook properly?

264
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,440
After your dad

265
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,399
passed away,

266
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,360
actually,

267
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,960
I did try

268
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,120
to learn how to cook.

269
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,080
But I could never recreate his flavor.

270
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,480
So then, I dated.

271
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,000
I kept getting into new relationships.

272
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,480
But still, no one

273
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,960
could cook like your dad did.

274
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,519
Later on,

275
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,919
I figured it out.

276
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,200
Actually,

277
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,799
the most delicious taste

278
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,799
is the one you can never taste again,

279
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,639
the one that remains only in memory.

280
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,559
It's the same with people.

281
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,600
Mom.

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,840
I want to ask you.

283
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,080
If you had known from the start

284
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,759
that Dad would leave so soon,

285
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,080
would you still have chosen to be with him?
