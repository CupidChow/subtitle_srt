1
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:44,799
Mr. Shen.

2
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,759
Good morning.

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,200
Would you like to have breakfast together?

4
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,600
It's me, Yin Erfeng.

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,119
Back when we graduated,

6
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,159
we even went camping together.

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,799
Don't you remember?

8
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,399
But the name I'm more famous by now is...

9
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,359
Yin Shanshan.

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,319
Which name you're more famous by

11
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,200
has nothing to do with me.

12
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,680
No, you... you...

13
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,719
Are you crazy?

14
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,400
You...

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,159
Shy.

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,480
You must be shy.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,640
Mr. Shen...

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,760
I'll just leave your breakfast by the door.

19
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,359
Make sure you eat up!

20
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,200
You...

21
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,120
Wait.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,519
She came looking for me as soon as she woke up.

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,400
And she knew I was in this room.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,680
How does she have her memories?

25
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,359
As long as you're happy.

26
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,519
I love you.

27
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,680
Cut!

28
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,200
Wonderful!

29
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,920
This love, hidden in the heart for so many years,

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,159
is finally spoken aloud!

31
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,800
That moved them so much?

32
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,159
What does the female lead

33
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,360
really need to do

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,759
to escape this time loop?

35
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,400
The male lead needs to

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,919
truly feel her love, of course.

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,240
Excuse me,

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
I need to step away for a moment.

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,000
To win over Shen Jiaqin,

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,080
it seems I must stoop

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,560
to learning from Cao Wen.

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Sister Wen!

43
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,639
When it comes to acting skills,

44
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,000
I still have much to learn from you.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,039
I need to study your methods.

46
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,360
For example,

47
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,759
your line just now, I love you...

48
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,120
How did you make it sound so sincere and moving?

49
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,039
Could you teach me?

50
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,240
I want to be as good as you.

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,039
Sister Wen!

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,639
Look,

53
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,479
after this project wraps up,

54
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,000
you're definitely going to be huge.

55
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,039
After that,

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,800
I might not get another chance to learn from you.

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,159
Still not enough?

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,319
Just watch me win you over.

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,800
I don't know

60
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,000
if you still remember...

61
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,520
My first acting experience

62
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,159
was in the short film you starred in,

63
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,479
Starlight For You.

64
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,639
I was just an extra.

65
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,039
Your guidance to me back then,

66
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,599
that one glance back...

67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,360
It truly brought me into the entertainment industry.

68
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
It made me a real actor.

69
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,560
Cao Wen,

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,639
you are my mentor.

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
You are like...

72
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,879
...a parent to me!

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
I love you varies depending on the context.

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
It's not the same.

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,519
For instance, I...

76
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,000
... the bitter love of unrequited feelings.

77
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,199
So when saying this line,

78
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,839
your face must show reluctance,

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,439
eyes brimming with tears,

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,720
and add a touch of restraint.

81
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,000
But you're different.

82
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,399
You and the male lead are kindred spirits,

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
destined to be together.

84
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,800
So your approach

85
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,399
should be full of happiness.

86
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,279
Full of happiness!

87
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,800
Naturally express your sweetness

88
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,879
and tenderness.

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
I understand.

90
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,000
Good, no paparazzi.

91
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,680
Around 7:20,

92
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,199
Shen Jiaqin appears nearby.

93
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,279
Three, two, one, action!

94
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,079
Yes, that's right.

95
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,519
I liked him back in high school,

96
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,920
you know.

97
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,879
I've liked him for so many years.

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,360
Kept it buried in my heart all this time.

99
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,639
Don't think for a second

100
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,040
that just because I'm a big star,

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,399
liking an ordinary person

102
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,720
is beneath me.

103
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,399
Today, now that we've finally reunited,

104
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,439
I must speak my love aloud.

105
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,959
Today, I must gather the courage to confess to him!

106
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,360
Shen Jiaqin!

107
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,759
There's something

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,480
I've kept inside for years.

109
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,959
Today,

110
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,720
I have to tell you.

111
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,600
Boss, I have something...

112
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,480
I have to go.

113
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,240
I don't know if you remember me...

114
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,680
Yin Erfeng.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,040
Your high school classmate.

116
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,120
Your senior.

117
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,959
That time we went camping, I already... fell for you.

118
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,480
It was love at first sight.

119
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,000
It's just a shame

120
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,439
my acting career kept me so busy.

121
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:41,560
So...

122
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,040
I missed the chance to meet you again.

123
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,319
And that one miss lasted...

124
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,120
...nine years.

125
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,040
So, now that we've finally met again today,

126
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,120
I must speak the love in my heart.

127
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,079
Shen Jiaqin, I love you!

128
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,199
So was I just dead for these nine years?

129
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
I may not be a celebrity like you,

130
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,800
but with my reputation

131
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,279
and my hotels,

132
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,920
finding me these past nine years

133
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
should have been pretty easy!

134
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,879
I... I just didn't have the courage before!

135
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,480
Yin Erfeng, let me tell you,

136
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,920
we were never classmates!

137
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,160
We were just schoolmates!

138
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,240
And at that camping trip, during the group photo,

139
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,920
I left right after it was taken!

140
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
How could you fall in love at first sight?

141
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,600
Whether you believe it or not,

142
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,759
I really

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,839
love you.

144
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,800
Shen Jiaqin, I love you!

145
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,959
Love you, love you, love you so much!

146
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
Shen Jiaqin, don't go!

147
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,480
I really, truly love you!

148
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,319
Miss Yin.

149
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,439
I just have a good memory.

150
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,560
I must cut all ties with you

151
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,040
to keep you safe.

152
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,680
As long as we don't know each other,

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,199
you won't be in danger anymore.

154
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,919
Help her out.

155
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,879
I sacrificed so much!

156
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,639
Used every method I could think of.

157
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,240
This time it has to work.

158
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,279
One more minute.

159
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,559
My day is almost over.

160
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,200
My loop is finally going to break!

161
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,159
Hey, Siri!

162
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
What's the date today?

163
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,279
Sunday, July 27th, 2025.

164
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,559
I have to say,

165
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,639
your skull is quite standard.

166
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,600
Could rival a lab specimen.

167
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,919
Thanks...?

168
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,480
So, what seems to be the problem?

169
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:35,840
Doctor,

170
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,639
lately, I think I've been having... hallucinations.

171
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,279
I've... already lived through today countless times.

172
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,879
What I mean is, I'm stuck in today.

173
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,039
An infinite loop.

174
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,440
Stuck on one day.

175
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,919
Infinite loop.

176
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,679
No tomorrow.

177
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,679
Right!

178
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,240
Infinite flow!

179
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,919
It's infinite flow!

180
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,480
You get me.

181
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
Understood.

182
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,240
Out the door, turn left, sixth room.

183
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,600
Thank you, Doctor.

184
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,360
Don't mention it.

185
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:20,759
Specialist appointment.

186
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,600
Yes.

187
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,279
Our psychiatry specialists are excellent.

188
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,360
Just yesterday we had a time traveler.

189
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,320
You're the crazy one!

190
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,559
If I escape this place,

191
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,679
I won't run into Shen Jiaqin,

192
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,480
won't run into the reporters.

193
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,240
Let's see how it loops then!

194
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Where are you off to now?

195
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,799
Yin Shanshan!

196
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,720
I find you're getting better at throwing your weight around.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,919
You didn't show up for the scheduled press conference.

198
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,600
Has Xu Jinbai ever done anything like that?

199
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,399
Can you stop bringing him up?

200
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,120
And it has nothing to do with him anyway!

201
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,919
Fine. Okay.

202
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,120
Whether you're in a bad mood from the breakup

203
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,320
or throwing a tantrum for some other reason,

204
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,480
I've already smoothed over all the work

205
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,799
you missed by disappearing all day.

206
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,960
So I'll pretend

207
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,600
nothing happened today.

208
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,799
But you must attend the dinner tonight.

209
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,840
The company is already pushing Xia Yan hard.

210
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,279
It's a dual female lead show,

211
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,360
if she gets top billing too,

212
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,399
you'll have no position left.

213
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,840
I'm not going! I won't go!

214
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,799
Change your clothes, now, immediately!

215
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,159
Go apologize to Mr. Zhao and the others.

216
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm not going!

217
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
If I go out, I'll run into that Shen Jiaqin again!

218
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,120
Not going!

219
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:42,879
Shanshan!

220
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,559
What's going on?

221
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
You and Xia Yan are the stars of today's conference!

222
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,399
You not showing up

223
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,360
is a huge incident!

224
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,639
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.

225
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,080
I really wasn't feeling well today.

226
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,440
I went to the hospital.

227
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,000
My apologies. Let me punish myself with a drink.

228
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,799
You're not feeling well?

229
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,080
What's the illness?

230
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,320
Here, let me take a look.

231
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,559
I studied traditional medicine for a few years.

232
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,399
Well, you see,

233
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:23,600
the doctor said I have a mental illness.

234
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,600
Look, take another look.

235
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,279
Miss Xia,

236
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,840
the song you sang today was so beautiful.

237
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,399
Really.

238
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,159
Let me tell you,

239
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,799
not only are you pretty,

240
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,519
your voice is also very sweet.

241
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,759
Thank you for the praise, Mr. Zhao.

242
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,279
Actually,

243
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,320
my fans have also been

244
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,720
eagerly waiting for me to release a single.

245
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,200
If I could sing the theme song

246
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,639
for this project,

247
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,679
I would be absolutely thrilled.

248
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,320
It's settled then.

249
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,879
Let's cooperate happily.

250
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,759
Come on, drink!

251
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,440
Drink with me!

252
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,960
Come on, have another sip!

253
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,120
Xia Yan!

254
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,720
Haven't you had enough of being a drinking buddy?

255
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,600
Oh, it's you, Yin Shanshan.

256
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,399
Mr. Zhao said

257
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,960
the first credit is mine.

258
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,480
Is...

259
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,639
...it's mine!

260
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,840
-Top billing is yours
-It's mine!

261
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,360
Mr. Zhao...

262
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,159
...is yours too

263
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:54,000
Yin Shanshan, you're actually giving in?

264
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,759
I won!

265
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,480
Those three drinks were worth it!

266
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm going back for three more!

267
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,320
What's that movie called again?

268
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,279
Coming for You

269
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,679
Coming for You

270
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,320
You...

271
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,360
...better not try to steal it from me.

272
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,519
You know you can't win against me, right?

273
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,279
You know that?

274
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,360
Step aside.

275
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,799
Don't fight me for it.

276
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,799
I'm telling you,

277
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,759
don't forget...

278
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,120
Please, sis, I'm begging you,

279
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,080
don't grab it!

280
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,080
Xiao Yan!

281
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,799
You're finally out.

282
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,799
I've booked the largest suite in this building.

283
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,480
Brewed the finest tea.

284
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,320
Just waiting for you.

285
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,360
Mr. Zhao,

286
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,080
I happen to have some excellent tea too.

287
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,279
Shall I take you to taste it?

288
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:41,759
Let's go.

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,399
Shanshan!

290
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,720
You're here too?

291
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,639
Come on, let's all go drink together.

292
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,960
What are you doing, Zhao Debiao!

293
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,759
Good!

294
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,200
I just love feisty beauties like you!

295
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:57,840
Let's go.

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,039
Mr. Zhao, don't you like Yan Yan anymore?

297
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,840
Let me accompany you for a drink, okay?

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,519
I know how to have a good time.

299
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,480
Sorry, Mr. Zhao,

300
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,240
I've had a bit too much to drink.

301
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,679
Let me finish throwing up,

302
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,840
then I'll take you up...

303
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,360
Stay... stay away from me.

304
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,799
I'm feeling a bit tired too.

305
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,679
You should rest early.

306
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,879
I'll be going now.

307
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,279
Mr. Zhao, don't go!

308
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,000
Xia Yan!

309
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,399
Was that really necessary?

310
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,240
Idiot.

311
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,000
I have a second round to attend.

312
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,960
Let Lin Ru take you back.

313
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,320
I really don't know

314
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,480
how you've lasted this long

315
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,240
in this industry.

316
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,879
Is she really drunk or not?

317
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,840
Ruru, which floor are you on now?

318
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm coming to find you.

319
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,080
Okay.

320
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,000
Xia Yan is drunk.

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,159
Now it's just the two of us.

322
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,399
Keep me company tonight.

323
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,559
What are you doing?

324
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,080
What am I doing?

325
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,799
Let me tell you,

326
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,720
I invest in films.

327
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,799
I spend money making all these shows

328
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,200
just to get more girlfriends!

329
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,840
What?

330
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,080
What's wrong?

331
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,519
Zhao Debiao!

332
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,440
What are you doing? Let go!

333
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,159
Let go! Get off!

334
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,039
You old creep!

335
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,279
You!

336
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,840
You what?

337
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,960
Who the hell are you?

338
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,559
Are you okay?

339
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,440
Shen Jiaqin! It's you again!

340
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,000
Where are your paparazzi?

341
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,080
Come out and film!

342
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,480
So what if it's a time loop?

343
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,399
I'm letting loose today!

344
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,120
Zhao Debiao!

345
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,720
You disgusting pervert!

346
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,080
Pervert!

347
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,000
Take that, you pervert!

348
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,320
Stop, stop!

349
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,960
Don't film!

350
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,440
Stop filming!

351
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,039
Don't!

352
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,120
Stop hitting!

353
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,399
Spare me! Have mercy!

354
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,519
Filthy bastard!

355
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,320
Are you crazy?

356
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,480
Have you lost your mind?

357
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,799
Why aren't you leaving? Get out!

358
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,000
You fat pig!

359
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,159
Loop away!
