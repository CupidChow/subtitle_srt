1
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,759
Guys, breaking news!

2
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,320
We've just found the disgraced star,

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,759
Yin Shanshan!

4
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,000
Guys in the livestream,

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,600
follow our drone camera

6
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,920
for an unprecedented aerial broadcast!

7
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,159
Stop following me!

8
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,159
Yin Shanshan!

9
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,519
The roof is dangerous!

10
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,719
Come down with me.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,000
Who... who are you?

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm the one who accidentally entered your room...

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,760
You're with the paparazzi, aren't you?

14
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,280
I'm begging you...

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,519
Please, just stop filming me!

16
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,640
I'm the general manager of this hotel.

17
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,959
I'm Shen Jiaqin.

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,760
Come with me.

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,920
What are you doing? Let go of me!

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,120
Let me go!

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,079
Jin!

22
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,120
Don't call him!

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,439
Quick! Yin Shanshan is over there!

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,359
Yin Shanshan!

25
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,200
Hurry, hurry! She's here!

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,680
Shanshan, we heard you've been bullying

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,760
other actresses on set. Is it true?

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,519
Is that true?

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
Many crew members have revealed

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,760
that you're the real boss on set,

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,840
even the director listens to you?

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,280
Really?

33
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,000
Is your innocent image just a facade?

34
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,000
Is it true?

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,719
Answer us!

36
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,799
Is it? Tell us!

37
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,280
Shanshan!

38
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,359
Say something!

39
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,920
Shanshan, please answer!

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,080
Shanshan! Shanshan!

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,680
Shanshan, answer us!

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,599
Shanshan, careful!

43
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,280
Help me!

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,879
Save me!

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,159
Somebody help!

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,039
This is my hotel room?

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,280
A nightmare...

48
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,800
It felt so real.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,919
Did I die and get reborn?

50
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,360
Shanshan, quick, quick!

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
It's time for hair and makeup!

52
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,120
You can't be late for today's event!

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,039
Today's event?

54
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,639
The red carpet was yesterday, wasn't it?

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,159
Yin Shanshan!

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,240
The 27th?

57
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,680
Wasn't yesterday the 27th?

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,919
Was that just a nightmare?

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
Why is it the 27th again?

60
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,039
This confused state I'm in...

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
is definitely not my usual style.

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,960
Normally, I'm

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,919
the one who gathers all the starlight,

64
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,639
Nation's Little Sister

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,680
That's right.

66
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,840
I'm the superstar, Yin Shanshan.

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
Sometimes, fame is a pain.

68
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,080
It makes you a target for all kinds of people.

69
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,400
Over here! Look here, Shanshan!

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,000
Like Xia Yan, who's about to walk the red carpet with me.

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,759
A rookie from the same company,

72
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,280
shows me, her senior, no respect,

73
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
and always tries to steal my spotlight.

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,599
She claims she's the new top star.

75
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,479
Xia Yan! Xia Yan!

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,599
Xia Yan! Xia Yan!

77
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,439
Xia Yan!

78
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,519
Xia Yan! Xia Yan! Xia Yan!

79
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,279
See?

80
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Today, Xia Yan's trick is to wear the same dress.

81
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,399
Wearing the same outfit isn't the issue,

82
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,639
the scary part is Yin Shanshan still thinks she won.

83
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,199
Can Yin Shanshan's team find someone else to leech off?

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,560
A fading star buying PR to outshine a rookie.

85
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,040
She's really trying hard to stay relevant.

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,360
Yin Shanshan insists on putting others down.

87
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,360
Can Yin Shanshan stop embarrassing herself?

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,560
Yin Shanshan purposely wore the same dress!

89
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,360
Plastic sisterhood shattered!

90
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,959
Okay, now,

91
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,759
let's invite the bridesmaid

92
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,040
to present the rings and her blessings.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,759
Right after the event,

94
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,560
I rushed non-stop

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,199
to the wrap party for another project.

96
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,040
I know Cao Wen has been jealous of me for ages.

97
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,920
I never thought for the final scene,

98
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,680
she'd still change the script to mess with me.

99
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,720
Shanshan,

100
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,959
you are my best friend.

101
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,800
On your most important day,

102
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,079
I want to give you my blessing.

103
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Here.

104
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,800
Cao Wen, what are you doing?

105
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,480
There's no wine-throwing in the script!

106
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,560
See, Director?

107
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,439
If we don't discuss it beforehand,

108
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,720
Shanshan can't handle the scene at all.

109
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,480
Shanshan, I didn't call "Cut"!

110
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
How can you break character?

111
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:26,879
I...

112
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,759
Shanshan, even if the script changes,

113
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,319
unless the director says "Cut",

114
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,199
you have to keep acting!

115
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,720
You've been an actor for seven or eight years.

116
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,720
Don't tell me you don't know

117
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,839
such a basic rule?

118
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,079
Is this a normal script change?

119
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,079
After throwing wine, my makeup and hair are ruined!

120
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:42,720
Let me tell you,

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
if one detail is off, we have to reshoot!

122
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,759
All the time will be spent

123
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,720
on me!

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,600
I think you're just...

125
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,639
A sudden splash of wine

126
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,720
left me stunned.

127
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,399
But it became proof of my bad acting and diva behavior.

128
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,319
Poor Cao Wen!

129
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,360
Does an art-house actress deserve this?

130
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,839
They should investigate her past co-stars.

131
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,439
Probably many were bullied too.

132
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,040
Yin Shanshan is so good at hype.

133
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,000
Is she trying to steal attention by whitewashing herself?

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,279
Always heard Yin Shanshan had a bad temper,

135
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,279
didn't know it was this awful.

136
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,920
Look at this!

137
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,839
Flipped from outshine articles to on-set bullying scandal!

138
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,639
Is this the end for Yin Shanshan?

139
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,879
Ironclad proof Yin Shanshan is past her prime!

140
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,720
Everyone kicks a person who is down.

141
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,879
In the evening, I was forced to attend

142
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,160
a dinner with that creepy investor, Boss Zhao.

143
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,000
Forced to drink glass after glass,

144
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,439
I got dizzy and stumbled into the wrong room.

145
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,639
Jin, open the door!

146
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,399
Then reporters swarmed the door.

147
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,560
My carefully built Nation's Little Sister image...

148
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,160
completely destroyed.

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,759
Scheming two-faced bitch Yin Shanshan fooled me for ten years!

150
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,360
Give me back my youth!

151
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,639
Entertainment industry sure is wild.

152
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,439
Yin Shanshan will do anything to get ahead.

153
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,000
Yin Shanshan's resources are ridiculously good.

154
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
With her bad acting, she still gets S+ projects?

155
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,079
This is the "pure" little sister you praise?

156
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,160
Meeting tycoons at night, drunk and disorderly?

157
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,920
From on-set bullying to night meetings with tycoons,

158
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,959
Yin Shanshan's rise is more dramatic than a palace intrigue!

159
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,000
Who'd believe she has no powerful backer?

160
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,879
To escape the paparazzi,

161
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,240
I ran to the hotel roof,

162
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,519
only to be followed.

163
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,680
Is it true?

164
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,199
Answer us!

165
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
In the chaos,

166
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,480
a strong force pushed me off the building.

167
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,879
Who would've guessed,

168
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,600
when I opened my eyes, I'd be back

169
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
in my own bed,

170
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,959
and the date was still the 27th?

171
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,040
Shanshan, quick, quick!

172
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,319
Time to go to makeup!

173
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,000
You can't be late for today's event!

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,160
The 27th?

175
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,639
It's the 27th again?

176
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,120
Why am I back on the worst day

177
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,360
of my life?

178
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,639
Is this a rebirth or a nightmare?

179
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,600
Let's get ready to go.

180
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,199
I see the photographers are setting up.

181
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,639
We'll get stunning photos today for sure.

182
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,439
I remember in yesterday's dream, on this red carpet,

183
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,800
Xia Yan purposely wore the same dress,

184
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,360
stole my spotlight, made me look bad.

185
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,399
Is Xia Yan here yet?

186
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,759
Not yet, why?

187
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,319
Don't worry,

188
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,079
you'll definitely outshine that fake socialite.

189
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,600
If everything from the dream is real,

190
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,839
then I'm in big trouble.

191
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,079
What's going on?

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,000
It's exactly the same as my dream.

193
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,920
Why the same dress?

194
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,319
This red carpet again, Xia Yan again,

195
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,120
planning to wear the same dress again.

196
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,759
What's wrong with me?

197
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,519
Why is this terrible day

198
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,439
happening again?

199
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,759
Give me the makeup bag.

200
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,519
Here.

201
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,240
Xia Yan,

202
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,680
this time, let's see how you play the same dress game.

203
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
Shanshan!

204
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,200
Shanshan! Shanshan!

205
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,960
Shanshan! Shanshan!

206
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,799
Shanshan, so beautiful!

207
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
Shanshan!

208
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,320
Shanshan!

209
00:08:59,399 --> 00:08:59,960
Hey.

210
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,679
Just to steal the spotlight,

211
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,039
you purposely wear the same dress?

212
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,440
Sis,

213
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,039
we're supposed to be the sister duo.

214
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,879
Wearing the same clothes

215
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,039
gives the reporters more to talk about, right?

216
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,960
Ladies, look here for a photo together!

217
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,039
Sis, keep smiling.

218
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,879
You don't want the paparazzi catching you roll your eyes, do you?

219
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,840
The female lead for Coming for You will be mine.

220
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,159
And when Eternal Resentment airs,

221
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,240
the top billing will be mine too.

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,399
Over here!

223
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,480
After the dinner tonight,

224
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,440
Boss Zhao is even inviting me for tea.

225
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,080
You know what kind of man Boss Zhao is!

226
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,320
I know.

227
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,000
So what?

228
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,639
What's a little sacrifice for success?

229
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,200
If those words you just said

230
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,159
were heard by your rich boyfriends,

231
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,639
what would they think?

232
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,600
Smile!

233
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:09,960
They're filming us!

234
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,840
Okay, now,

235
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,279
let's invite the bridesmaid

236
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,919
to present the rings and her blessings.

237
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,480
Cao Wen again.

238
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,919
If it's like yesterday's dream,

239
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,720
You are my best friend...

240
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,000
that scheming bitch will splash wine in my face again.

241
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,120
I want to give you my blessing.

242
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,159
Here.

243
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,399
Cao...

244
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,559
Just like the dream.

245
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,639
Wait.

246
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,559
Cao Wen is doing this on purpose.

247
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
She wants to make me lose my temper.

248
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,360
Fine.

249
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
Since fate let me see the future

250
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,200
in my dream,

251
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,080
Cao Wen,

252
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,440
I'll play along.

253
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,679
You're my best friend,

254
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,799
why would you do this to me?

255
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,440
You two...

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,879
I'll give you what you want!

257
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,200
Cut!

258
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,840
Great! Excellent!

259
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,120
Shanshan, that improv was fantastic!

260
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,600
I thought it was... brilliant!

261
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:11,960
Come here.

262
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,240
When Cao Wen changed the script,

263
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,960
I was worried,

264
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,960
but now it's clear,

265
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,519
Shanshan,

266
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,039
you are this project's

267
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,399
fated leading lady!

268
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,120
Thank you, Director.

269
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,759
Cao Wen,

270
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,919
why did you freeze up?

271
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,759
Why didn't you keep acting?

272
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,480
Director, let's do another take.

273
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,159
I can definitely do it better this time.

274
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,720
That would waste so much time.

275
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,519
Forget it.

276
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,399
Doesn't matter.

277
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,720
The shot won't focus on you anyway.

278
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,960
Cao Wen, even if you change the script,

279
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,240
before the director calls "Cut",

280
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,639
we have to keep acting, right?

281
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,480
You've been an actress for over ten years.

282
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,000
You must know that basic rule, surely?

283
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,000
Yin Shanshan's acting is this good?

284
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,720
Guess I was only noticing her looks before.

285
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,360
Cao Wen always boasts about being a veteran,

286
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,639
but she pulls shady tricks on set.

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,519
Luckily our Shanshan's acting is impeccable,

288
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,360
she can handle anything.

289
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,440
Did you see Yin Shanshan's expression shift?

290
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,840
Textbook-level acting.

291
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,080
Now that's professional.

292
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,440
Someone should take notes.

293
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,440
Yin Shanshan's improv is so good!

294
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,960
Shanshan, you're amazing!

295
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,399
You predicted she'd try to sabotage you!

296
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,360
You were prepared.

297
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,600
This is perfect.

298
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,159
She tried to scheme but got caught in her own trap.

299
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,120
She's in trouble now.

300
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,320
How's the script looking?

301
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,399
Don't like it.

302
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,240
But this is the one you wanted originally.

303
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,200
This is Director Chen's first film

304
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,600
in five years!

305
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,440
So many people are fighting for a spot.

306
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,879
I'm not doing it.

307
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,039
Fine, don't go.

308
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,960
Suit yourself.

309
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,399
The company prefers to push Xia Yan anyway.

310
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,240
I heard they're already negotiating the contract.

311
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,519
The script...

312
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,840
Also, I asked around

313
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,080
about who influences the casting.

314
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,639
I heard

315
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,639
the behind-the-scenes owner of H Hotel

316
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,000
might invest in this film.

317
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,480
They say the owner comes from a prominent family.

318
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,919
What's the name again...

319
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,360
Shen Jiaqin.

320
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,600
Shen Jiaqin?

321
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,240
Got a photo?

322
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,840
I'm the general manager of this hotel.

323
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,480
I'm Shen Jiaqin.

324
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,080
It really is him.

325
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,879
Shanshan,

326
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,919
no matter what, we need to get on the investor's good side.

327
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,080
It'll help

328
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,519
our chances of getting the film's female lead.

329
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,000
Everything that happened today

330
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,279
is just too strange.

331
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,039
It's her.

332
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,320
Shen Jiaqin.

333
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,000
Everything from yesterday felt so real.

334
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,840
Was it a dream, or did it happen again?

335
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,519
Why is this happening?

336
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,279
The one who saved me on the roof yesterday was Shen Jiaqin.

337
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,440
No.

338
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,960
I need to find a way to get some answers.

339
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,080
Hi.

340
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,960
Haven't we met before?

341
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,120
Hello, Miss Yin Shanshan.

342
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,679
I'm the executive assistant at H Hotel.

343
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,279
My name is Lu Yun.

344
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,080
Here's my contact information.

345
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,840
I think I...

346
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,039
saw you in my dream.
