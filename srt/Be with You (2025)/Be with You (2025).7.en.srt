1
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
I can't do it.

2
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,840
Well,

3
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,040
are you always bullied at school?

4
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,959
I'm used to it.

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,280
What?

6
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,439
You are so tall.

7
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,519
They bully you every day?

8
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,159
If you encounter something, don't be afraid.

9
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,400
Tell the teacher at school,

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,640
and tell your parents outside.

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,519
What are you afraid of?

12
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,280
That's not what you said before.

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,000
What did I say before?

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,959
You said don't do anything that makes your family

15
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,120
feel sad,

16
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,359
and don't regret it when you lose them.

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,200
What does this have to do with family?

18
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,200
Why is Er Feng acting so strange today?

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,040
She seems like a different person.

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,480
She wasn't like this before.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
You're so unreliable.

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,040
She's just a high school student.

23
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,840
How can I kiss her?

24
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,239
Do you really want to kiss her?

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,560
Of course.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,520
I've worked hard for ten years

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,639
to be the leading lady in Director Chen's movie.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,400
I don't want to go through that Shen Jiaqin thing

29
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,280
again.

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,840
I've learned about it.

31
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,560
Do you want to hear it?

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,520
You just said I was unreliable.

33
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,719
Sorry.

34
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,639
I know you're the most reliable.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,840
Tell me.

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,800
You know what?

37
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,000
Shen Jiaqin

38
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,360
is an illegitimate child.

39
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,479
An illegitimate child?

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,960
Keep your voice down.

41
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,400
It's a secret.

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,439
Okay.

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,439
And the boy who always bullied him

44
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,719
is Shen Zhihe,

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,280
his half-brother.

46
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,400
It is said that Shen Jiaqin's father

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,159
married Shen Zhihe's mother.

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
After Shen Zhihe's mother died,

49
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
he took Shen Jiaqin

50
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,879
into Shen Zhihe's home,

51
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,879
and announced that

52
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:15,639
he would

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,479
hand over all the groups

54
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,080
to Shen Jiaqin in the future.

55
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,680
That's my mom's company.

56
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,039
You can't give it to him.

57
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,840
It's mine,

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,719
not his.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,879
He's your brother.

60
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't have this brother.

61
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,800
He's just an illegitimate child.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
He doesn't deserve to be in this family at all.

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,000
Why should he take away my mom's things?

64
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,360
Even the scripts for TV dramas

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,520
are not as dramatic as this.

66
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,120
No wonder Shen Zhihe has been bullying him.

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,199
But this is

68
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,479
an issue between adults.

69
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,159
Why are the kids getting involved?

70
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,520
But then again,

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,759
they're just high school students.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,919
How could they possibly understand

73
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,840
I've also learned

74
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,719
the source of your relationship.

75
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,639
I really have a relationship with him.

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,479
After Shen Jiaqin entered the school,

77
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,719
he fought with Shen Zhihe.

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,400
It can also be said that he was beaten up.

79
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,439
At this time,

80
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,800
a beautiful senior stepped in to help.

81
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,399
Guess what?

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,279
What?

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,160
That senior girl

84
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,079
was you.

85
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,199
It was me.

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,439
But why don't I remember anything?

87
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,480
He didn't fall in love with me

88
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,279
just because of this, did he?

89
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,000
It's hard to say about the love of a youth.

90
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,199
God must have sent me to save him.

91
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Yin Erfeng, where are you going?

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
It's almost time for evening self-study.

93
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:47,959
It's okay.

94
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:24,600
Go.

95
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,519
Go.

96
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,959
Don't come to me.

97
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,120
in case they see you.

98
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,639
You are brave.

99
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,439
Just wait.

100
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,800
No one dares to bully you, right?

101
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,399
I'll make you a cup of green plum water.

102
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,160
Every time I'm in a bad mood,

103
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,160
I like to drink water like this.

104
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,480
Why do you drink water like this?

105
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,759
I taught you this method.

106
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,560
How is that possible?

107
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,240
A friend of mine taught me this.

108
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
What's the name of your friend?

109
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,040
Something is wrong.

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,199
What exactly

111
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,160
have I forgotten?

112
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,600
Erfeng,

113
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,959
You really don't remember me?

114
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,639
We

115
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,839
are not just

116
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,240
ordinary friends.

117
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,079
We are the most...

118
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,319
Okay.

119
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,839
How could I forget my best friend in high school?

120
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,600
I don't know Lin Ru. I don't remember her.

121
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
Tomorrow is a holiday.

122
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,759
At this time, Jin must be practicing in the music classroom.

123
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,959
Jin is really Jin.

124
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,040
As long as he is there, he will always shine.

125
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,519
At that time,

126
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,079
just because I saw him,

127
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,399
I felt that he was my eternal future.

128
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,040
You're running around during the evening self-study again.

129
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,839
Aren't you the same?

130
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,480
You come out to practice during evening self-study.

131
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,439
I'm doing it for my future.

132
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,920
Me too.

133
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,600
My future

134
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,959
is you.

135
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,319
Alright, let's stop here for today.

136
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,800
The competition is coming up soon.

137
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,160
and the art exam is just three months away.

138
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,720
Lin Ru,

139
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,839
you should take care of yourself.

140
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,879
It hurts again.

141
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:40,360
When did Lin Ru and Jin become so close?

142
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,799
You carry it everywhere?

143
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,559
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

144
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,639
Erfeng,

145
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,720
why are you here?

146
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,879
Is she your good friend?

147
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,559
Hello,

148
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,240
I'm Xu Jinbai.

149
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,759
You don't know me?

150
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,399
I don't think

151
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,200
we've met before.

152
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:24,960
Where are you going?

153
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,080
Erfeng!

154
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,480
Erfeng!

155
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,720
Where are you going?

156
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,360
I'm going home.

157
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,679
Don't scare me like that!

158
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,960
I shouldn't have kept you from Xu Jinbai.

160
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,919
I don't mean to blame you.

161
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,639
I just

162
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,480
have a lot of things I don't understand.

163
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,240
I need to go home

164
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,440
and talk to my mom.

165
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,960
Erfeng,

166
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,879
don't do this.

167
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,879
Your mom wouldn't want to see this.

168
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,799
What do you mean?

169
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,600
What happened to my mom?

170
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,320
Er Feng, what's going on?

171
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,279
Er Feng, Er Feng.

172
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,919
Ms Yin.

173
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,720
Ms Yin.

174
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,960
My mom...

175
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,159
What happened to her?

176
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,399
She passed away in a car accident last year.

177
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,080
Er Feng.

178
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:40,840
Why didn't you...

179
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,879
Why didn't I go back?

180
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,960
Go back?

181
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,679
Why am I still here?

182
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,600
Why haven't I gone back?

183
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,039
What's wrong?

184
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,039
Shen Jiaqin.

185
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,399
I don't know you.

186
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,960
I'm not the Yin Erfeng you know.

187
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,519
This isn't my memory.

188
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,279
This isn't my high school.

189
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,360
This isn't my life.

190
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,480
In my life,

191
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,279
Ms. Yin is alive and well.

192
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
She's tolerant of me.

193
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,039
protected me,

194
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,759
and let me grow up carefree.

195
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
I miss her.

196
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,759
I want to go home.

197
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,679
Why am I here?

198
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,799
Why did you do this?

199
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,159
Why do you have to trap me

200
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,200
in your obsession?

201
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,720
Why did I tell you so much?

202
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,000
You don't understand at all

203
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,120
the pain of losing a mother suddenly.

204
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,440
Is our relationship

205
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,120
really my obsession?

206
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,039
Then from today,

207
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,200
we

208
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,559
don't know each other.

209
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,360
There, there, don't cry.

210
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,360
You two were so close,

211
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,080
how did you end up arguing like that?

212
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,080
Auntie,

213
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,919
do you know me?

214
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,440
You two

215
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
have been doing volunteer work here.

216
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,080
We really like you both.

217
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,679
Auntie,

218
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,960
I seem to have forgotten something.

219
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,360
Could you tell me about him and me?

220
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,440
Shen told me that

221
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,200
your mothers

222
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,159
both passed away on the same day in the hospital.

223
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,799
[So Shen Jiaqin's mother passed away too?]

224
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,720
You wouldn't understand

225
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,960
the pain of losing a mother.

226
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,440
I shouldn't have said that to him.

227
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,039
I was too impulsive just now.

228
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,039
So, am I really

229
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,480
his only

230
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,399
and best friend?

231
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,000
I see.

232
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,759
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,919
Shen Jiaqin.

234
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,000
I sincerely apologize.

236
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,559
Hold on for two minutes, and you'll feel dizzy.

237
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,399
Let's see how long you can hold on.

238
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,159
If you speak, I'll take it as forgiveness.

239
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,399
No.

240
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,879
Shen Jiaqin.

241
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,799
Listen carefully

242
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,759
to what I'm about to say.

243
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:10,639
I

244
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,279
come from ten years later.

245
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,600
I'm Yin Erfeng, 27 years old.

246
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,919
Now my name is Yin Shanshan.

247
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,879
I'm an actress.

248
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm a star.

249
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,440
I don't know

250
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,000
what exactly went wrong.

251
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,279
I went back ten years ago.

252
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,879
And this ten years ago is completely different

253
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,759
from my memory.

254
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,960
In my memory,

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,080
my mother is not dead.

256
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,960
I don't know you either.

257
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,240
But during this time,

258
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,879
I've enjoyed being

259
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,399
your friend.

260
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,399
Did I say too much?

261
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,320
You did.

262
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,080
What do I need to do

263
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,840
to let you return to your life?

264
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,200
I realized you're not Er Feng a long time ago.

265
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,639
Since the day you came to me

266
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,399
and almost got hit by a car on the road,

267
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,919
I've noticed you're not like her.

268
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,639
But I'm glad I met you.

269
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,399
Because I can see

270
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,240
a different Er Feng.

271
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,279
A happy,

272
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,640
outgoing,

273
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,200
and brave.

274
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,720
Or should I call you Yin Shanshan?

275
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,440
Call me sister.

276
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,920
I'm ten years older than you.

277
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,279
Sis,

278
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,400
if you help me find a way back,

279
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,079
I'll help you find the courage

280
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,240
to live a happy life, okay?

281
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,039
Sounds good!

282
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,200
This watch,

283
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,519
my mom left it to me.

284
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,519
Didn't you always wear it?

285
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,920
After she passed away,

286
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,759
I was afraid of breaking it,

287
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,880
so I kept it here.

288
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,720
Can I

289
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,599
show it to me?
