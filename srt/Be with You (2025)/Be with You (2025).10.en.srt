1
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,399
Boss,

2
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,119
I heard you managed to

3
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,560
win Yin Shanshan's heart again,

4
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,399
made her fall for you all over again.

5
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,320
Well, everyone was gonna find out eventually.

6
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,319
I don't need to take this medicine.

7
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,760
I think you should take it, stop you from gossiping.

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,799
Boss,

9
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,120
you're the one in the situation,

10
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,560
I'm the one on the sidelines.

11
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,519
I still remember,

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,319
when that car came speeding towards you,

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,760
Yin Shanshan ran to you faster

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,920
than the car itself.

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,519
It was just...

16
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,560
like lightning striking,

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,159
and you both passed out at the same time.

18
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,959
But the strange thing is,

19
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,400
you both woke up at the same time too.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
Don't you think that's the biggest...

21
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,799
fate?

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,280
Boss,

23
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,879
you've been so low-key depressed

24
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,079
since you woke up.

25
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,000
What's wrong?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Even the fact that Yin Shanshan likes you

27
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,280
can't make you

28
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,000
a little happier?

29
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,840
When I was in a coma,

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,359
it felt like I fell into a

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,040
pitch-black little room.

32
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,239
All my past memories

33
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,640
flashed before my eyes.

34
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,480
But I'm convinced

35
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,120
it must have been her.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,479
Boss,

37
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,960
could you explain it a bit

38
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,840
clearer?

39
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,800
The Yin Shanshan I met when I was seventeen,

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,039
was from the future.

41
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,039
She's the present-day Yin Shanshan.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,280
The one we know now.

43
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,280
Then why were you in such a hurry to be discharged?

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,439
To avoid her?

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,919
Because

46
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,280
I'm not ready for her questions.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,879
Excuse me,

48
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,639
which room is Shen Jiaqin in?

49
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,560
Shen Jiaqin? One moment.

50
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,599
He's already been discharged.

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,439
Discharged?

52
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,120
Honestly, what's with him?

53
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,599
He didn't even come to see you after waking up.

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,319
You're in the hospital because you saved him!

55
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,400
It's like he's avoiding you.

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
He's definitely avoiding you on purpose.

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,479
He's avoiding me?

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,240
Yeah!

59
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,840
Probably scared of having to pay compensation.

60
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,159
You were in a coma for so long,

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,080
think of the lost time and opportunities.

62
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,080
I was only out for a few days.

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,840
A couple of ads and I'd make up for it.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,080
It was more than a few days.

65
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,639
You were in a coma for almost a month.

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,360
I was in a coma for a month?

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,599
Yeah.

68
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,960
Then Coming for You must have started filming already!

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,400
The female lead is in a coma,

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,280
an investor is in a coma...

71
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,400
How could they start filming?

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,719
Good that it didn't start.

73
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,120
Good that they didn't replace me.

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,719
Shanshan,

75
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,919
you just rest well in the hospital for now.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Leave everything else to me.

77
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:53,960
Eat.

78
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,919
Eat more.

79
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,560
Good girl.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,800
You need to eat another one.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
Enough, enough! I really can't eat anymore.

82
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,120
I bought all of this especially for you.

83
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,560
This hospital, you know,

84
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,000
is completely unreliable.

85
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,040
And your company won't agree to transfer you.

86
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,920
If you ask me,

87
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,800
your company is unreliable too.

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,720
Look at that guy, Zhang.

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm almost embarrassed to say it...

90
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,360
He's so ugly.

91
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,319
Doesn't look like a good person at all.

92
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,279
Ms. Yin, when will you learn

93
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,800
not to judge people by their looks?

94
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,439
Who doesn't like pretty things?

95
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,399
Look at my daughter.

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,040
The more I look, the prettier she gets.

97
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,680
The more I look, the more beautiful she is.

98
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,399
It's so good to have you.

99
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,240
It's so good to be back.

100
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,439
Visit home more often.

101
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,480
And, uh,

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,720
help me keep an eye out...

103
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,600
Which patient's family are you?

104
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,920
I knew I'd find you here.

105
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,480
Do you know you're not even healed yet?

106
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,439
The doctor told you not to overexert yourself!

107
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,319
Keep your voice down.

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,519
Don't disturb them.

109
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,279
Worry about yourself first.

110
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,920
She has plenty of people taking care of her.

111
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,120
Let's go.

112
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,160
Come on.

113
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,839
Do we have to sit like this?

114
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,920
Just do me this favor, please?

115
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,160
I'm really fine, physically.

116
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,639
You and my mom,

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,319
one of you confiscated my phone,

118
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,199
the other locked me in my room.

119
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Right now, I feel like I'm in prison.

120
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,639
Shanshan,

121
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,120
your mom is really worried about your health.

122
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,560
As long as your next full check-up is clear,

123
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,040
I'll let you be discharged.

124
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,199
The next full check-up...

125
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,439
That's not until next Friday!

126
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,879
Isn't the company anxious?

127
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,920
Isn't the crew anxious?

128
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,279
They...

129
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,720
I'm sure they're very worried about you.

130
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,680
After all, you were in a coma for a month after the accident.

131
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,399
If you go straight back to work after waking up,

132
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,240
they'll definitely think

133
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,519
they're exploiting you.

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Well, that's true.

135
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
Then I'll just film a video now

136
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,639
saying I've recovered,

137
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,720
and show it to my fans.

138
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,439
They haven't seen me for so long,

139
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,240
they must be worried about me,

140
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,199
they must miss me.

141
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,399
Shanshan,

142
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,639
I'll arrange all of that.

143
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,040
You just rest well in the hospital.

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,079
Be good.

145
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,560
Shanshan,

146
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,399
Mom's going to get food for you.

147
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,199
You be good, okay?

148
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,319
Behave.

149
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,000
Wait for me.

150
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,560
I will.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,080
Ruru.

152
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,879
You've been so busy lately,

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,480
I think you've lost weight.

154
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,360
Don't run around everywhere.

155
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,600
I'll be good.

156
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,600
These candidates now,

157
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,639
they just don't have any viral potential.

158
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,840
Can't you find some

159
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,279
male guests with more buzzworthy topics?

160
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,919
The ones you have here

161
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,000
aren't even as interesting as my fake friendship

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,159
with Yin Shanshan was.

163
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you all doing every day?

164
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,679
Shanshan.

165
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,320
I told you to find someone with couple chemistry,

166
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,559
not just repeat what I say.

167
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,639
Sis Shanshan!

168
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Sis Shanshan!

169
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Congratulations, Xia Yan.

170
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,639
Or should I call you

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
the new top star?

172
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,799
Oh, stop it.

173
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,440
You have no idea,

174
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,759
I'm so happy

175
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,639
you're out of the hospital.

176
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,039
If you hadn't come back,

177
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,000
Coming for You wouldn't have been able to start filming.

178
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,399
Boss Zhang was so worried.

179
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,399
Or should I say, overjoyed?

180
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,000
That online gossip,

181
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,639
was that your doing?

182
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,159
Online?

183
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,039
Sis Shanshan,

184
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,399
Move.

185
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,000
What online gossip?

186
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,240
I don't understand what you're talking about.

187
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
I've been hoping for your recovery all along!

188
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,240
Even when the producers said

189
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,840
they'd let me take the female lead and start filming,

190
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
I turned them down!

191
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,000
I swear!

192
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:26,919
Shanshan.

193
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,480
Sis Lin Ru.

194
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,039
We're such good friends,

195
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,279
there's no way you'd smear my name, right?

196
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,039
Right?

197
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,799
Y-Yes, of course!

198
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm just so happy you're out of the hospital.

199
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,679
Really.

200
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:50,960
Yin Shanshan!

201
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,799
You really know how to run around.

202
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,679
Is it really necessary?

203
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,360
Boss Zhang has ordered the whole company to blacklist you!

204
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
Just because I had an accident

205
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,519
and delayed the movie's production?

206
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,279
Boss Zhang pulled a lot of strings

207
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,399
to arrange for Xia Yan to play

208
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,159
the lead in Coming for You.

209
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,440
But then you convinced the whole crew

210
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,440
to hold a public vote.

211
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,919
And once you won,

212
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,679
all of Boss Zhang's connections went down the drain.

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,399
Whether Xia Yan acts,

214
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,039
or I act,

215
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,440
doesn't Boss Zhang make money either way?

216
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,159
Xia Yan has a backer, an investor.

217
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,320
He was going to invest in the company,

218
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,200
but because the role wasn't finalized for her,

219
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,200
he pulled his investment entirely.

220
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,879
So she does rely on a sugar daddy.

221
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,879
I got the female lead role

222
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,559
purely on my own merit!

223
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,799
Shanshan,

224
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
are you sure there's nothing else

225
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,759
going on between you and that Shen Jiaqin?

226
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,679
Why don't you believe me?

227
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,960
I already told you,

228
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,039
I saved him

229
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,000
purely out of a sense of duty.

230
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,600
Shen Jiaqin is an investor for Coming for You.

231
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,399
The live public vote giving you a chance was his idea.

232
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,679
If you really think about it,

233
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,159
you're the one with the sugar daddy.

234
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,679
So Boss Zhang thinks

235
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,840
that when Xia Yan finds a backer,

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
it makes him money.

237
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,440
But when I find a backer,

238
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,480
it ruins his plans.

239
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
For now,

240
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,080
let's just lay low here in the hospital.

241
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,279
No.

242
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,200
I want to go to the Coming for You set.

243
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,679
I've already seriously

244
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,639
studied the script.

245
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,120
I really like this script.

246
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,000
I won't give up this opportunity.

247
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,399
I want to use this chance

248
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,200
to become a real actress.

249
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,960
But this is a movie, after all.

250
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,559
The big screen will magnify your performance.

251
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,080
This character is a female lead with a terminal illness.

252
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,399
Most of her scenes require a bare face, no makeup.

253
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,799
Shanshan, I'm just not sure

254
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,600
if this role is really the right fit for us.

255
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,080
But in the beginning,

256
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,879
you were the one who gave me the script.

257
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,679
You told me to fight for this role.

258
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,240
And I fought for it and won it.

259
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,879
But while you were in a coma,

260
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,120
the production team held many meetings.

261
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,200
Director Chen isn't very confident in your acting skills.

262
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,519
He strongly insisted on replacing you.

263
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,320
What exactly is it about Yin Shanshan

264
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,480
that doesn't meet your standards?

265
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,480
Director Chen.

266
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,960
What do you think is the problem

267
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
with Yin Shanshan's performance?

268
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:22,759
Director Chen,

269
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,240
I'd like to discuss this with you from a professional perspective.

270
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,679
I really think Yin Shanshan's acting is very strange.

271
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,759
Why does she try so hard,

272
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,320
but her acting is still no good?

273
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,320
This is just a question from

274
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,240
an avid film enthusiast seeking knowledge.

275
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:57,679
No soul.

276
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,440
Terminal illness and love both require genuine empathy.

277
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
Genuine empathy...

278
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,519
I think yours is much cuter than mine.

279
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,279
They're both cute enough.

280
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,399
Hello.

281
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,200
You look unfamiliar.

282
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,240
Are you a patient's family member, or...?

283
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,960
I saw the hospice ward information online.

284
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,919
I saw you were looking for volunteers.

285
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,200
I thought so.

286
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,000
Actually, I recognized you!

287
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,039
Yin Shanshan.

288
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,759
Researching for a role, right?

289
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,519
Interested in volunteering with us?

290
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,279
Of course.

291
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,000
This place,

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,320
is basically for patients who have been, well, sentenced...

293
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,279
with a terminal diagnosis.

294
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,600
We try our best to let them

295
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,120
live their final days

296
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,559
with dignity and happiness.

297
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,440
Besides medical care,

298
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,279
we also need many volunteers

299
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,519
to help them

300
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,879
fulfill their final wishes.

301
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,159
Are those people in mascot costumes up ahead

302
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,879
going to perform a show later?

303
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,519
Yes.

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,879
You're just in time.

305
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,279
We have a young patient named Keke.

306
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,639
She was recently transferred to our hospice ward.

307
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,000
She has a tumor here,

308
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,159
pressing on her optic nerve.

309
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,799
She's basically lost her sight.

310
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,360
She keeps talking about

311
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,919
wanting to go to an amusement park.

312
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:28,720
So,

313
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,519
we're preparing to let her experience

314
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,879
an amusement park-style performance.

315
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
Performing for terminally ill children, huh.

316
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,600
Shen Jiaqin?

317
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,440
You know our Team Leader Shen?

318
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Team Leader Shen?

319
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,480
Yes, he's the leader of our volunteers.

320
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
He was one of the earliest volunteers to join our ward.

321
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,399
We should do more

322
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,960
of these activities in the future.

323
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:57,320
Go team!

324
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,679
Go! Go!

325
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,399
Shen Jiaqin!

326
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,679
Shen Jiaqin!
