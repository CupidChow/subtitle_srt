1
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,079
This...

2
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,759
is my most valuable possession.

3
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,399
I leave it to you.

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,640
I hope you can be like me,

5
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,200
and strive for the ones you love.

6
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,640
Some things are destined.

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Don't force it.

8
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,280
I understand.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,439
Thank you, Mom.

10
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,239
Car accident.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,519
2 PM.

12
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,159
Instant death.

13
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,560
There's still time.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,959
If I could save Erfeng's mother,

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,439
I can definitely save Erfeng too.

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,040
Auntie!

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,359
Are you okay?

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,319
Are you hurt?

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,799
Watch how you're driving!

20
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,640
Let me help you up.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,719
Any cuts?

22
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,680
Are you alright?

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,480
You scared me to death!

24
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,879
Hello, is this Mr. Shen?

25
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,359
Your mother, Ms. He Manting, has just passed away.

26
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,519
Please come to the hospital as soon as possible.

27
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,120
Mom...

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,960
To save me and my mom,

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,919
Shen Jiaqin missed seeing his own mother for the last time.

30
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,520
Mr. Shen.

32
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,159
The morgue is on B2.

33
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,680
Make the arrangements soon.

34
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,879
Let your mother rest in peace.

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,039
Please accept our condolences.

36
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,439
Sitting in this is so uncomfortable.

37
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,800
I told you I'm perfectly fine!

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
You had to get me a wheelchair.

39
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,360
Ms. Yin,

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,599
do you know you scared me to death?

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,439
I thought I'd never see you again!

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,879
It's okay, it's okay.

43
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,360
Look,

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,680
nothing's wrong at all.

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,639
Cover it, cover it up.

46
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,719
Your mom is so lively.

47
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,280
How embarrassing.

48
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,719
Be careful now.

49
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,039
Sweetie,

50
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,319
let me tell you,

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,400
it's all thanks to this young man.

52
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,120
Auntie,

53
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,840
your daughter is just worried about you.

54
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,759
Once you finish all these check-ups,

55
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,159
she'll feel relieved, won't she?

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,240
Okay, okay.

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,800
I'll listen to you.

58
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,520
Erfeng,

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,919
we originally met in an elevator too.

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,759
Back then, your mother had just died in the car accident.

61
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,280
You were heartbroken, crying uncontrollably.

62
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,039
To comfort you,

63
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,360
I taught you how to drink plum juice.

64
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,560
Shanshan,

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,199
this Xiao Xu is a good kid.

66
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,960
Xiao Xu, what do you think of our Shanshan?

67
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm only in my second year of high school!

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,520
Ms. Yin!

69
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,199
You can start dating in advance!

70
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,159
But this time,

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,000
I reversed time to save your mother,

72
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,480
overwriting your memory of knowing me.

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
From then on,

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360
your world

75
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,600
had no trace of me anymore.

76
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,279
When I habitually

77
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,480
went to look for you after class,

78
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,560
I realized

79
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,800
you didn't know me at all anymore.

80
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,360
And in your eyes,

81
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,959
Lin Ru, hurry up!

82
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,040
Your world

83
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,639
Jinbai is waiting for us to practice!

84
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,480
only had Xu Jinbai.

85
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,839
Is he your savior or your crush?

86
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,879
Both, both!

87
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,519
Let's go!

88
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,279
Hurry!

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,480
Happy?

90
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:06,759
Yes!

91
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:07,800
Good.

92
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,600
Let's come play again next time.

93
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,399
Are you hungry?

94
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,120
Tonight...

95
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,040
June 27th, 2016.

96
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,399
Late at night.

97
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
Shanshan has had accidents on this night countless times.

98
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,680
It's like a curse.

99
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,959
As long as you're safe tonight,

100
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,800
we can break this curse.

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,079
A talent scout?

102
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,639
Really? Is it reliable?

103
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,160
Jin Ge already signed.

104
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,240
If he thinks it's fine,

105
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,360
then I think it's fine.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,399
In the future, I need to change my name.

107
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,800
Yin Erfeng sounds awful.

108
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,600
Yin Shanshan.

109
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,560
How about that?

110
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,480
Good.

111
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,199
When you become a big star,

112
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,519
I'll be your assistant.

113
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,639
No way, you can't just be an assistant.

114
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,560
Aren't you my best friend?

115
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,240
At the very least,

116
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,720
you have to be my manager.

117
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,480
Erfeng.

118
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,519
You're finally

119
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,399
safe.

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,639
Shanshan, you're finally awake!

121
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,360
What's wrong?

122
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,439
I didn't know anything.

123
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,519
Why didn't he say anything?

124
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,680
Why didn't he tell me?

125
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,680
There, there, don't cry.

126
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,839
When I found you,

127
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,399
only you and Mr. Shen were unconscious in the alley.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,279
There was no man in black like you said.

129
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
He...

130
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,600
Was he hurt?

131
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,680
No.

132
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,920
Then why won't he wake up?

133
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,160
Mr. Shen...

134
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,519
Mr. Shen has always had a hereditary blood disease.

135
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,680
It manifested even earlier than his mother's.

136
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,600
While there's no scientific basis for it,

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,279
every time he uses this...

138
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,879
uses the watch,

139
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,160
his physical condition deteriorates further.

140
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,000
It's gotten much worse recently.

141
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:18,879
Will he...

142
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,240
Will he die?

143
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,680
Mr. Shen...

144
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,039
has already made his will.

145
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,799
He instructed me long ago that

146
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,200
at the end of his life,

147
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,279
all his assets are to be given to you.

148
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,399
Regardless

149
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,840
of whether you two knew each other.

150
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,200
This is a notebook

151
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,759
Mr. Shen always carried with him.

152
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,679
I think you should read it.

153
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,399
I've tried countless methods,

154
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,039
but I couldn't save her.

155
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,679
Once she becomes the most important person to me,

156
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
she leaves forever.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,759
Perhaps

158
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,000
this is my fate.

159
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,440
But it shouldn't be hers.

160
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,200
Alright, Sis.

161
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,559
I always remember that sunny, fearless Yin Shanshan

162
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,799
who claimed she had traveled back

163
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,159
from ten years in the future.

164
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,679
She said she became a big star,

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,360
standing on stage, loved by countless people.

166
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,000
She said her mother was by her side,

167
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,440
giving her love and freedom.

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,759
She had the gentlest boyfriend in the world,

169
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,519
the most loyal friends.

170
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,320
That is her true destiny.

171
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,480
But in that beautiful future,

172
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,399
there is no me.

173
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
If possible,

174
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,759
I'm willing to lose her,

175
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,360
so she can have the best life possible.

176
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,159
I went back.

177
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,879
I really changed the course of events.

178
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,000
The moment she passed by me,

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,480
laughing and joyful,

180
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,320
I knew

181
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,440
she was heading towards the happy fate

182
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,519
of Yin Shanshan.

183
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,600
Jinbai,

184
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,159
remember to eat.

185
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,039
June 27th.

186
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,600
The most critical time point after high school graduation.

187
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,480
She passed through it safely too.

188
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,879
This proves

189
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,240
that I am the cause of the end of her life.

190
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,840
I like you.

191
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,399
I like you too.

192
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,879
I won't

193
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,080
appear before her again.

194
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,159
As long as I can watch her live well from afar,

195
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,480
that's enough.

196
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,440
I will never, ever get close to her again.

197
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,559
I will never, ever

198
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,440
tell her

199
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,840
that I love her.

200
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,720
Miss Yin, you can't go in here.

201
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,399
Miss Yin!

202
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,960
Shen Zhihe!

203
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,279
We need to talk.

204
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

205
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,200
I couldn't stop her.

206
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,919
What?

207
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,639
Will?

208
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,120
Shen Jiaqin isn't even dead yet!

209
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,200
Are you in such a hurry?

210
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,320
It is a will.

211
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,759
But not Shen Jiaqin's.

212
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
It's your father's.

213
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,159
Yes.

214
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,919
The Shen Group should belong to Shen Jiaqin.

215
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,240
And I took it from him. So what?

216
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,519
He didn't even flaunt it over me.

217
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,679
What gives you the right?

218
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:50,919
This will

219
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,480
is a private agreement between Shen Jiaqin and your father.

220
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,200
You haven't seen it.

221
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,799
Shen Jiaqin never intended

222
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,039
to take anything from you.

223
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,960
Even your father.

224
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
never planned to give the company to him either.

225
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,440
This agreement clearly states

226
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,559
that he would manage the company on your behalf,

227
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,320
and after turning its losses into profits,

228
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,480
return the company to you.

229
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,960
Such a fake document.

230
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,440
Do you think in this world

231
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,159
there would be someone who wants nothing

232
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,519
and just manages a company for others?

233
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,080
Shen Jiaqin would.
