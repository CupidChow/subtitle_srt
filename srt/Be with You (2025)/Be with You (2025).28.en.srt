1
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,600
Xiao Xia

2
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,000
I think my eyebrows are a bit uneven.

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,119
Can you come over and take a look?

4
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,439
Sis

5
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,560
Let me fix them for you.

6
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,239
Mm, hurry.

7
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,920
Look at what they did.

8
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,280
How did they do my makeup?

9
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,400
Done.

10
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,239
Xiao Xia still does it best.

11
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,280
And this?

12
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,760
It's from your favorite anime.

13
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,439
I specifically contacted their director

14
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,359
to get you a personalized autograph.

15
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:44,560
This...

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,040
This isn't a farewell gift, is it?

17
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,799
You want to quit?

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
No, not at all.

19
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,040
It's just that before...

20
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,359
That's all in the past now.

21
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,000
Just keep working.

22
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,120
You're good at your job.

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Why wouldn't we keep you?

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,799
Plus, we'll double your salary.

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,120
We'll be counting on you from now on.

26
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,240
Thank you, Sister Lin Ru.

27
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,439
Thank you, Sister Shan Shan.

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,159
I'll work really hard, I promise!

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,360
But, you know,

30
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,280
if you want

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,960
to be real sisters with us,

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,319
you'll have to make some sacrifices.

33
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,280
Like joining us for meals,

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
catching movies...

35
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,879
It'll cost you your free time.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,639
Later, Lin Ru and I are seeing Jinbai's new movie.

37
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,439
Wanna join?

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,560
Is it okay if I don't?

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,120
Why not?

40
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,159
My boyfriend bought tickets too.

41
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,319
Boyfriend?

42
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,319
The reporters who bought my info...

43
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,560
none of them ever posted negative stories about me.

44
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,439
And that time I went home,

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,439
Xiao Xia didn't tell anyone.

46
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,240
Another dead end.

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,840
Hmm.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
But this person was the first

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,759
to actively contact Xiao Xia.

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
And he was so sure

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Xiao Xia is someone close to you.

52
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,199
He must have been planning this for a long time.

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,759
Planning for a long time...

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,919
Secretly watching...

55
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,280
Right.

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,960
Isn't that just you?

57
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,199
M-me? I'm different!

58
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,599
It's because of love!

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,319
But seriously,

60
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,159
if he's watching you this closely,

61
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,360
you must have some impression of him, right?

62
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,919
I remember all the reporters who often interview me.

63
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,120
But this person...

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,840
I really have no memory of him at all.

65
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,919
Laying low.

66
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,520
Watching you silently.

67
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,000
And he knows such detailed information.

68
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,000
It's too strange.

69
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
That sounds really creepy.

70
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,560
Of course it's creepy!

71
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,680
Is that what you used to do?

72
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,080
I'm trying to have a serious discussion here!

73
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,599
Tell me about your thought process.

74
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,000
Share your experience.

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,919
If even you can slip up,

76
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,759
then he...

77
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,759
I didn't just slip up.

78
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,800
Shen Jiaqin analyzed it for so long,

79
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,439
and his conclusion was for you to walk into danger?

80
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,879
This plan to walk into danger...

81
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,920
wasn't his idea.

82
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,360
And I didn't even tell him.

83
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,120
You knew that reporter

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
might be suspicious,

85
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,319
yet you still scheduled an interview?

86
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,199
Actually,

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I just wanted to test the waters at first.

88
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,319
I never expected

89
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,839
he'd agree so readily.

90
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,600
But it's a public event.

91
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,759
No need to worry too much.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,120
There will be plenty of us there.

93
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,959
Don't be afraid.

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,319
You've always had the image of the 'pretty face' of idol dramas.

95
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,199
In this movie,

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,639
aren't you worried

97
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,959
you'll hold back the two seasoned actors?

98
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,680
He kept telling me

99
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,639
he likes Shan Shan.

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,319
Something's wrong.

101
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,519
Contact Lu Yun, quick!

102
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,319
Indeed.

103
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,560
In the past two years, acting-wise,

104
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,920
I just didn't get it.

105
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm ashamed to say,

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,800
I even thought,

107
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,399
for an actor,

108
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,360
being pretty is enough.

109
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,319
So this time,

110
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,800
I worked really hard to join this film

111
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,160
because I wanted to learn from

112
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
the other actors.

113
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,800
And I've learned a lot.

114
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,920
But honestly, I was still worried during the process.

115
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,160
I worried

116
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,920
I wouldn't be able to keep up with the senior actors.

117
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Actually, Shan Shan has improved tremendously lately.

118
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,279
Often,

119
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,399
I was the one who couldn't keep up with her.

120
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,120
Is it because it's just too bad?

121
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,040
I think whether it's good or bad,

122
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,160
you at least need to watch the finished product

123
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,720
before you can judge.

124
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,720
Shan Shan,

125
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,920
aren't you worried the box office will flop?

126
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,879
Does that mean your star power

127
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,519
isn't real either?

128
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,600
Star power is fleeting.

129
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,920
For us actors to last,

130
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,240
we rely on acting skills.

131
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,759
It's true my acting wasn't great before.

132
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,519
But thanks to my fans' support,

133
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,240
I need to work even harder.

134
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,360
I want everyone to keep me accountable,

135
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,000
to help me become a better,

136
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,319
a different Yin Shan Shan.

137
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,160
I'm so angry!

138
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,000
What was that reporter even saying?

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,519
Before, he was all sweet-talking me,

140
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,399
saying he liked Shan Shan.

141
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,639
Turns out he's a hater!

142
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,439
He doesn't just dislike Shan Shan.

143
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,240
Between the lines,

144
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
he was sticking up for that Cao Wen.

145
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,120
Is he connected to Cao Wen?

146
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,959
Alright, don't be angry.

147
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
But we did gain something.

148
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,759
At least we know we targeted the wrong person.

149
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,560
Isn't a hater even more suspicious?

150
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,360
But his eyes,

151
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,920
and the vibe he gave me...

152
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,480
were completely different from the person

153
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,199
who attacked me that day.

154
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm going to the restroom first.

155
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,319
Want me to come with you?

156
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,040
No need.

157
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,800
You guys pack up.

158
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,639
We'll leave when I get back.

159
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,399
We'll do better next time.

160
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,360
The main issues, I think,

161
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,920
are just minor ones.

162
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,800
Nothing worth mentioning.

163
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,480
Hello.

164
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,920
I'd like to invite you to the premiere

165
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,519
when the movie is released.

166
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,639
I hope you'll honor us with your presence and judgment.

167
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,639
Both positive and negative feedback are welcome.

168
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:42,839
Sure.

169
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,199
I'd like to see

170
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,439
what this idol actress Cao Wen praised

171
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,560
is really like.

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,839
Thank you.

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,240
I'll have Xia Lulu contact you later.

174
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,519
Xia Lulu?

175
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,759
Who is she?

176
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,800
She's the one you've been

177
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,240
contacting on Weibo.

178
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,560
No, I don't know her.

179
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,319
Was... was that person just now...

180
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,800
one of your staff?

181
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,560
Isn't he from your crew?

182
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,319
If you want material, ask your own crew.

183
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,759
Thank you.

184
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,839
Did he pose as a reporter to contact Xiao Xia

185
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,199
and get my schedule?

186
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,920
I think I found him.

187
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,759
Shan Shan?

188
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,679
Where are you going?

189
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,799
It's urgent!

190
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,440
I think I found him.

191
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,519
It's me! It's me!

192
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,279
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is

193
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,279
for you to come up here alone?

194
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:57,960
I found him.

195
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,840
Let's go first.

196
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,519
Wait.

197
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,639
Look.

198
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,480
Watch out!

199
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,120
I'll kill you!

200
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,720
Run!

201
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,639
Come here! I'll kill you!

202
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,919
Cao Wen?

203
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,639
What are you doing here?

204
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,240
I saw you rushing off in a panic,

205
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,039
and I was worried.

206
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,279
So I followed you.

207
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,759
What is this place?

208
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,240
What are you doing here?

209
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,559
Let's just go.

210
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,480
What's wrong?

211
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,639
You guys go first.

212
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,919
You go first.

213
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,799
Call the police!

214
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,480
No!

215
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,080
What are you doing?

216
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,600
What I mean is,

217
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,960
if you stay here,

218
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,639
and the police show up later,

219
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,720
if you're photographed,

220
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,960
the court of public opinion won't let you go.

221
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,440
Cao Wen.

222
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,279
Was it you?

223
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,440
What?

224
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,559
Were you the one who gave the killer my information?

225
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,480
Was it you?

226
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,799
What are you talking about?

227
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,519
Are you being threatened by him?

228
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,440
I saw

229
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,919
your photo inside.

230
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,559
Photo?

231
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,799
Impossible.

232
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,240
He didn't get a clear shot of my face.

233
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,399
Cao Wen.

234
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:07,840
Cao Wen!

235
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,360
Cao Wen! What are you doing? Stop!

236
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,639
What are you doing?

237
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,200
You're destroying evidence!

238
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Don't do this! Stop!

239
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,559
Do you want to keep it to threaten me?

240
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,919
I never thought about threatening you!

241
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,519
I escaped it.

242
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,799
I really escaped it.

243
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,480
The one who should have suffered all this

244
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,559
was supposed to be you.

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,559
It was me.

246
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
That night was supposed to be you.

247
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,240
The person in that photo should have been you.

248
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,440
I...

249
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,360
Look at them.

250
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,080
These are all innocent victims.

251
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,960
The one who should have suffered all this was supposed to be you.

252
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,960
Isn't it just because someone gave you a boost?

253
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,840
Letting you escape,

254
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,840
making someone else bear it.

255
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,080
You know about the watch.
