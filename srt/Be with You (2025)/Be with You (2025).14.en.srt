1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
So this watch...

2
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,640
It can really reverse time?

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,600
Yes.

4
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,079
Normally,

5
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,119
when I go back to the past,

6
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,880
I'm the only one who experiences it.

7
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,200
But I don't know why,

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,679
you could feel it these last few times.

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,200
It might be because...

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,560
when I pulled you on the rooftop,

11
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,359
you accidentally touched my watch.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,280
That's what caused the time reversal.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,359
So that time on the rooftop...

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,560
It wasn't a dream at all.

15
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,719
It was real.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,599
And that time we were in a car accident...

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,400
Shen Jiaqin, hang in there!

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,879
I touched your watch again.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,799
Time reversed,

20
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,079
and sent me back to our school days.

21
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,719
It was all real.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,599
I wasn't sure at first.

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,159
But after what you said when you woke up...

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,599
I'm certain.

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,840
Your consciousness really went back ten years.

26
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,640
I didn't know how to explain it to you,

27
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,599
so I had to keep it a secret.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,959
But back in my student days...

29
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,400
I didn't even know you!

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,319
Or rather...

31
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,719
I don't remember knowing you.

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,680
We did know each other.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,120
So the memories of us meeting...

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,000
were overwritten when you used the watch

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,719
to reverse time.

36
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,680
That's why I don't remember you now.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,840
Back then, we were more than just friends.

38
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,680
Erfeng.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,000
You asked me...

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,360
why I took the college entrance exam early.

41
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,400
It's because I didn't want a puppy love relationship.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,560
I wanted to graduate with you.

43
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,840
I wanted to be with you.

44
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:21,960
I liked you.

45
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,360
I...

46
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,879
liked you too.

47
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,560
Or should I say...

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,280
Shanshan.

49
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,639
Boss.

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,360
Shanshan.

51
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,479
I...

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,199
Everyone you care about...

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,400
will die.

54
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,639
What's going on?

55
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,319
Why did the Ferris wheel suddenly lose power?

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,000
No...

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,879
If I say it out loud now,

58
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,759
she'll still be in danger.

59
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,439
Boss.

60
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,879
Someone cut the power to the amusement park.

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,080
I've sent people to fix it.

62
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,280
You... be honest.

63
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,840
But then why...

64
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,840
didn't you come find me again?

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,240
Why, now that I know everything,

66
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,599
are you still unwilling to admit it?

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,879
Because I was afraid.

68
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,719
Shen Jiaqin.

69
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,759
Everyone you care about...

70
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,400
will die.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
The moment I saw you again,

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,159
I couldn't hide...

73
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,599
my true feelings.

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,120
Let me ask you.

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,960
All those times you reversed time before,

76
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,919
it was because my public image was collapsing.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,759
Why did you save me?

78
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Because I love you.

79
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,160
But I couldn't.

80
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,240
For your safety,

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,160
I couldn't get close to you.

82
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
Because when you had your accident,

83
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,680
it happened to be at my hotel.

84
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,040
I was afraid it would affect my hotel's operations.

85
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:36,800
Really?

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,279
Really.

87
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,240
Shen Jiaqin!

88
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,680
You clearly like me!

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
Why say such hurtful things?

90
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,560
Why do you care about me so much,

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,720
yet keep pushing me away?

92
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,160
Heaven, help me!

93
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,759
A dozen double-daring doughnuts dove down a deep ditch

94
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,839
A dozen double-daring doughnuts dashed past a deep ditch.

95
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,519
But, Boss...

96
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,000
saying that will hurt her so much.

97
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,399
Anyway, in her memory,

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,240
we weren't that close.

99
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,959
But it hurts you.

100
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
She seems pretty happy right now.

101
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:18,959
Besides,

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,560
I can't stay by her side forever.

103
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,240
Forget it.

104
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
I should just leave this place.

105
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,600
As long as I'm gone,

106
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,519
maybe he can finally have some peace.

107
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,319
Leaving?

108
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,959
Alright, alright.

109
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,480
I knew I couldn't just leave.

110
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,639
I knew you wouldn't last long.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,319
Don't act like you know me so well, okay?

112
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,319
Sis,

113
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,480
we're from the same company, after all.

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,040
We're selling the sister duo image.

115
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,279
A fake one.

116
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,680
Fine, fake sister.

117
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Maybe it's better if you go.

118
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,160
That way you won't interfere with me and my lover.

119
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
But...

120
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,720
sometimes I envy you.

121
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,600
You're so lucky.

122
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,639
So many people clean up your messes.

123
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,319
I'm more famous than you

124
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,240
because I rely on myself.

125
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,040
You got the part

126
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,199
because Shen Jiaqin recommended you to Director Chen.

127
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,600
When you messed up the live stream,

128
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,959
Xu Jinbai vouched for you.

129
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,439
Now you're running away again.

130
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,079
Is it Lin Ru's turn to bail you out now?

131
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,319
You can't even handle a simple variety show.

132
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,519
It's a miracle you've survived in the entertainment industry

133
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,959
for ten years.

134
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:00,839
Fine.

135
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,879
If you want to leave, then go.

136
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:03,879
From now on,

137
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,720
your popularity will all be mine.

138
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,839
Bye bye, Sis.

139
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,000
You... you little brat!

140
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,720
You just got on one...

141
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,439
scripted, cliché variety show!

142
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,000
It's not like you won Best Actress!

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,839
What are you so proud of?

144
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,399
I...

145
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,519
It's just acting!

146
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,199
I'm not as scheming as you,

147
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,759
but my acting skills...

148
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:25,920
You...

149
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
are definitely better than yours!

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,639
I...

151
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,879
Yin Shanshan!

152
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,360
Our ten-day Date with You

153
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,559
is coming to an end.

154
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,600
The final date

155
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,279
will take place on this isolated island, free from outside interference.

156
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,399
It's a survival romance challenge!

157
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,559
Survival for your crush's heart,

158
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,360
and actual survival on a desert island!

159
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,799
We need to collect all your personal items now.

160
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,159
Sorry,

161
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,519
phones too.

162
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,679
The lucky bags set by the production team...

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,240
must have something good inside.

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,480
Don't lose it.

165
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,080
What?

166
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,360
Take it.

167
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Watch this!

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,120
You open the one you got.

169
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,960
Aren't we a team?

170
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,120
It doesn't matter who opens it.

171
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,879
You do it.

172
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
Double the harvest!

173
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,279
Double the harvest!

174
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,639
But my basket is already full.

175
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,519
Doesn't that mean we can rest?

176
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,159
What about yours?

177
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,120
Let me see.

178
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,000
No rest for us, I guess.

179
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,399
Aren't razor clams seafood?

180
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,679
The production team must have placed them here.

181
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,320
Otherwise,

182
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,879
did you expect to fish in this little stream?

183
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,879
You don't even know that?

184
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,519
I don't know what you and Shanshan

185
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,759
even have in common.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,559
What we have in common

187
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,840
isn't limited to this.

188
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,720
I can provide for her.

189
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,679
I'm her boyfriend.

190
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,600
That matter

191
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,279
is none of your concern.

192
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,039
Ex-boyfriend.

193
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,600
I know her much better than you do.

194
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,799
I know her much better than you do.

195
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,279
Whether in the past or the present,

196
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,559
I understand her better than you.

197
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,279
The fact that you subjectively make judgments

198
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,679
for her...

199
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,679
proves I know her better.

200
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,799
Mine's bigger!

201
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,279
Mine is bigger!

202
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,039
Mine's bigger!

203
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
Mine is bigger!

204
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,240
Your foot.

205
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,000
What are you doing?

206
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,440
I can't have scars on my legs!

207
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,559
It's just swollen.

208
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,279
There's no wound at all.

209
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,399
How could it possibly scar?

210
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,279
Oh.

211
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,879
Then I'll start.

212
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,480
Ouch!

213
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:02,480
It doesn't hurt.

214
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,960
Xia Yan.

215
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,679
Hmm?

216
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,399
Did the production team leak the challenges to you?

217
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,960
How do you know how to do all this?

218
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,559
If the production team had leaked them to me,

219
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,440
I'd have found a hunk to protect me.

220
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,759
I'd be screaming like someone else,

221
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,039
Ah! Ah! Help!

222
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,480
So scared!

223
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,399
You're asking for it!

224
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,240
That way I could maintain my image.

225
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,759
Who would gather herbs for you?

226
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,279
How do you know so much?

227
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,320
Aren't these just basic mountain skills?

228
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,480
Mountain skills?

229
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,559
You lived in the...

230
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,159
I don't want this filmed.

231
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,080
When I was little, I lived with my grandma

232
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,200
in the mountains.

233
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,039
My grandpa, mom, and dad went to work in the city

234
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,759
and rarely came back for years.

235
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,519
If I didn't learn these skills,

236
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,440
how could I take care of Grandma?

237
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,559
I always thought...

238
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,120
your family was well-off.

239
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,120
Aren't you the rich heiress type?

240
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,240
And aren't you the Nation's Little Sister?

241
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,559
Are you insulting me?

242
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,840
Aren't they all just personas from the company?

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,559
They want me to be someone, so I act the part.

244
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,720
They pay, I perform.

245
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,559
It's a win-win.

246
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,200
I just think...

247
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,840
if I work hard and earn more money,

248
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,159
I can give my grandma a better life.

249
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,559
Here,

250
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,200
hold this for me.

251
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,039
The camera's on us.

252
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:49,559
Got it?

253
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,240
I'm done washing up.

254
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,240
Thanks.

255
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,559
Where's Shanshan?

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,039
Her sense of direction is so bad.

257
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:08,799
I hope she didn't get lost.

258
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
You're in her group.

259
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,240
Do you know where she went?

260
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
She said she'd follow behind me slowly.

261
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,840
She's not back yet?

262
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,120
Where's Yin Shanshan?

263
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,639
Mr. Shen,

264
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,919
the footage from our side

265
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,200
isn't uploaded in real-time.

266
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,960
We have to wait for the cameraman to return.

267
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
I don't need your explanation.

268
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,039
With all these cameras,

269
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,799
I want to see Shanshan right now.

270
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,159
Don't worry, the island is very safe.

271
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,960
We scouted it many times before coming.

272
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,120
I'm not reassured.

273
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,480
With so many cameras,

274
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,000
can't you find one person?

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,759
Find her now.

276
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:46,919
Everyone, go look for her!

277
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,360
Yin Shanshan is back!

278
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,120
Go.

279
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,360
Here, have some hot water.

280
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,000
Careful.

281
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,480
It's hot.

282
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,039
Didn't you say you'd follow behind slowly?

283
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,720
How did you wander off so far?

284
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,279
The cameraman said it was a new segment...

285
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,279
treasure hunt.

286
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,679
What treasure hunt?

287
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,559
Look.

288
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,279
What?

289
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,480
A task card.

290
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,360
Treasure Hunt.

291
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,639
It really is.

292
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,679
I walked for a long time.

293
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,320
What treasure?

294
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,559
I didn't see anything.

295
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,759
It was pitch black and scary.

296
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,200
Treasure hunt?

297
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,159
What treasure?

298
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:42,960
Director!

299
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,120
Explain this to me.

300
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,799
This was our mistake.

301
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,200
The cameraman

302
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,000
took Ms. Shanshan to an uncleared,

303
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,360
dangerous area of the production site.

304
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
He has been fired.

305
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,279
We guarantee no further problems.

306
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,440
If anything happens to Shanshan,

307
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,279
firing the cameraman will be the least of your worries.

308
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,720
Give me my phone.

309
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,480
I need to contact my own people.

310
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,440
President Shen,

311
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,359
there's really no signal on the island.

312
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,039
Here, take these two walkie-talkies

313
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,079
for now.

314
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,240
Find a way to contact the outside.

315
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,160
Thanks.

316
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,680
We'll restore the signal tower tomorrow.

317
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,599
Give me another chance.

318
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,920
Seize the opportunity today.

319
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,519
I will make Shen Jiaqin regret.
