1
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,280
Hello, Sister Xia.

2
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,759
No need to call me sister.

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,719
Oh, right.

4
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,359
Weren't you the one

5
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,960
who asked Shanshan for a signed photo last time?

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,880
I'll have Shanshan give it to you before filming wraps.

7
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,280
Thank you, Sis.

8
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,600
My daughter absolutely adores Shanshan.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,600
No problem. Let's look out for each other from now on.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,479
Thank you. Thank you so much.

11
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,880
Sister Shanshan, you can sleep in tomorrow.

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,439
But you might have to stay up a bit late at night.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,400
If you don't want to stay up late,

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,519
I can talk to the crew again,

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,879
see if we can change the night shoot.

16
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:11,959
Why?

17
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,519
I just don't want you to be too tired.

18
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,680
I'm asking you why

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,760
did you sell my information to the paparazzi?

20
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,519
I was wrong.

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,599
I ran into Sister Ru,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,280
she asked me, so I...

23
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,760
I didn't think she would also sell your information...

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,480
Xia Lulu!

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,200
Xiao Xia.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,000
You set me up together.

27
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,439
If you hadn't done anything wrong,

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,879
there'd be nothing to set up.

29
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,680
I gathered everyone here

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,319
to ask for your help.

31
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,879
To act out a scene with me.

32
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,879
To find out who exactly around me

33
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,760
is selling my information.

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,520
All these people

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
knew Shanshan's schedule the day she was attacked.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,360
Xiao Xia.

37
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,159
Director Chen.

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,719
Who's that?

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,520
My hairstylist.

40
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,800
Not many people knew the schedule that day.

41
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:26,960
After screening,

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,800
it was easier to narrow down.

43
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,439
What about us few?

44
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,280
If any of you wanted to harm me,

45
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,479
I wouldn't have lived till today.

46
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,240
What about Cao Wen?

47
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,159
She gave us

48
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,639
so much useful information.

49
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,719
It probably isn't her.

50
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,240
Then what about Xia Yan?

51
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,000
After the Coming for You

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,039
crew started filming,

53
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,479
she hasn't been with us.

54
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,639
She doesn't know my whereabouts after that either.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,159
If she does know,

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,719
it's from these people.

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
So what's your plan?

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,680
Lin Ru.

59
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
I need to have a big fight with you.

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,919
Only a handful of people know my schedule.

61
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,000
If it weren't for you,

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
how could the paparazzi catch me every single time?

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,759
Who else can you blame for your own problems?

64
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,639
Tell everyone

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,400
that you were the one selling my information.

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,240
So the real person selling my info

67
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,280
lets their guard down.

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,240
The evidence is conclusive.

69
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,280
Anything else to say?

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,840
Do I have to spell it out so harshly?

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
I can't serve this diva anymore.

72
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,400
Whoever wants to serve her can go ahead.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,039
Tell them

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,039
about my private date later.

75
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,000
My date with you.

76
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:26,919
We...

77
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,400
Xialuo Theater.

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm meeting someone to watch a play.

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,240
Xu Jinbai told me today he also wants to see a play.

80
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,840
Shh.

81
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,840
Keep it a secret for me.

82
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,319
Su Su.

83
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,840
Can you hurry up a bit?

84
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,400
Tonight at seven,

85
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,680
I have a date with Jinbai at Starlight Theater.

86
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,719
So romantic!

87
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,400
Don't tell anyone, okay?

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,639
Xiao Xia.

89
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm going to Hongguang Theater tonight at seven.

90
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,479
Remember to tell them

91
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,080
we must wrap on time today.

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,639
You got it, Sis.

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Finally, Lin Ru,

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,639
acting vengeful,

95
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,680
will ask these targets

96
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,000
for my whereabouts.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,759
Sister Ru.

98
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,000
Going on a date again after wrap, huh?

99
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,479
Why do we need Sister Ru

100
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,800
to go ask them again?

101
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,319
If they are really selling the schedules,

102
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,399
they definitely wouldn't sell info

103
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,839
that only they know.

104
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,120
But if I know it,

105
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,160
plus with my history of selling info,

106
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
if anything happens,

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
they'll definitely think it was me.

108
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,079
Not a date.

109
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,040
It's with Xu Jinbai, at Hongguang Theater.

110
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,879
Still so careless.

111
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,240
Then let the paparazzi catch her red-handed again.

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,959
Aren't you Yin Shanshan?

113
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,759
You've followed Shanshan for so many years.

114
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,360
Your compensation

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,839
has always been the best in the artist team.

116
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,839
Why would you do this?

117
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,279
Good pay,

118
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,680
long time...

119
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,079
So what?

120
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,000
Have you ever treated me as one of your own?

121
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
But I've always treated you like a younger sister.

122
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,360
Younger sister?

123
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,480
You suspected a mole in the team,

124
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
and the first person you ruled out was Lin Ru.

125
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,040
Not me.

126
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,160
Why?

127
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,519
Because deep down,

128
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,879
you only see me as staff.

129
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,399
We grew up together.

130
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,959
Yes,

131
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,680
you grew up together.

132
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
You're best friends.

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,399
So you can argue with her all you want,

134
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,079
because you know

135
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,199
no matter how much you fight,

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,439
you'll still be sisters.

137
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,920
But I'm just here to work.

138
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,800
I have to watch your mood,

139
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,120
and watch Yin Shanshan's mood too.

140
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,839
Every time you two argue,

141
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,680
I have to tread carefully in the middle.

142
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,839
And you,

143
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,360
Yin Shanshan,

144
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
do you know how spoiled you are?

145
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,079
We staff

146
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,360
have to follow you around every day,

147
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,079
constantly cleaning up your messes.

148
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,600
But no matter how much I do,

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
no matter how tired or hard I work,

150
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,879
your brainless fans just point at me and curse,

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
saying I'm not good enough.

152
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,360
I'm a person.

153
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
You're just a person too.

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,839
You're not a god.

155
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,079
I never thought that.

156
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:08,920
Xiao Xia.

157
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,079
You've always been

158
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,319
an indispensable part of our team.

159
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,839
I come to work,

160
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,399
hold one job,

161
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,000
do the work of five people.

162
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,079
Of course I'm indispensable.

163
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,199
I have to follow you to the set every day,

164
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,000
shoot videos, edit videos,

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,279
retouch photos, do touch-ups.

166
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
Who would do the work without me?

167
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,680
You keep saying I'm this

168
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,040
executive manager,

169
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,240
a publicist,

170
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,079
but look at how the crew staff

171
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,519
treat me.

172
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,040
And those media reporters.

173
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm just Yin Shanshan's little assistant.

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,399
I just wanted...

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,759
It's not like I did some terrible, heinous crime.

176
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,199
So you hated me?

177
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,399
You hated me so much you wanted to kill me?

178
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,680
Kill you?

179
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,399
How would I dare do such a thing?

180
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
What about the time in the forest,

181
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,120
and the incident at home?

182
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,279
Those two times were almost disastrous, you know!

183
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,720
How is that related to me selling info...

184
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,720
How could it be this serious?

185
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,439
I just sold Shanshan's information

186
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,240
to reporters who contacted me privately.

187
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,519
They all told me

188
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,319
they were Shanshan's most loyal fans.

189
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:15,720
After that...

190
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,759
I never sold to the reporters who published the leaks.

191
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,360
If you don't believe me,

192
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,199
check my Weibo DMs.

193
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,360
You can check.

194
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,199
Sister Shanshan,

195
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,519
I really never meant to harm you.

196
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,240
I just wanted to make some extra money.

197
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,000
That reporter told me at the time,

198
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,600
he said

199
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,399
the pictures I took were very good.

200
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,199
He said following you must be very hard for me.

201
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
He was so respectful and appreciative of me.

202
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,639
When he later asked for your schedule,

203
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,000
I just got carried away.

204
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,399
I thought, since I'd already given some,

205
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,600
might as well give a bit more.

206
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,480
I truly never thought it would hurt you.

207
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,839
When reporters started leaking stories about you,

208
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,319
I panicked.

209
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,680
After that, except for people I knew well,

210
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,199
I never sold anything again.

211
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,439
I believe you.

212
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,240
Xiao Xia.

213
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm sorry.

214
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,720
I neglected your feelings.

215
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I always saw you

216
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,879
so happy and cheerful.

217
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
I thought you really enjoyed being with us.

218
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,959
I thought you loved this job.

219
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,399
But I forgot

220
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,320
that the one chasing a dream all along

221
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,240
was me.

222
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,480
For all of you,

223
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,240
it's just a job.

224
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,399
And you, Lin Ru.

225
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,399
You've worked hard.

226
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,000
All these years.

227
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,759
Sister Shanshan, I'm so sorry.

228
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,039
I really know I was wrong.

229
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,320
I shouldn't have done this.

230
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:02,879
It's okay.

231
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,679
Big star.

232
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,360
So I was such a terrible person.

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Not terrible.

234
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,919
I think you're doing just fine.

235
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,600
I used to always think,

236
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,000
I want to be myself.

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,039
So I'll just be myself.

238
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,639
But I never knew

239
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,200
that my doing as I please

240
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,080
would cause so much trouble for the people around me.

241
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,080
Like Xiao Xia...

242
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,840
if I had cared about her more before,

243
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,120
would she be different now?

244
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,879
It's not too late to start now.

245
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,159
But I'm not good at caring for others.

246
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,240
I never realized before

247
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,639
that Lin Ru

248
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,639
and Xu Jinbai

249
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,159
have both been tolerating me like this.

250
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,399
But I'm not good at caring for others.

251
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,919
It's okay.

252
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,919
You have me.

253
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,440
I'm very good at it.

254
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:08,759
Boss.

255
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,679
If you keep pushing yourself like this,

256
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,840
your condition will only get worse.

257
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm out of time.

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,960
I have to find

259
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,799
the person who's been hurting her.

260
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,799
I need to ensure Shanshan's safety.

261
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,679
Then I can leave in peace.

262
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,679
Your health will definitely get better.

263
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,799
If nothing else,

264
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,039
just for Miss Yin's sake,

265
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,399
think,

266
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,919
if something happens to you,

267
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,279
who will be there for Miss Yin, right?

268
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,360
Brother.

269
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,799
I'm still

270
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,039
so afraid.

271
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:01,639
I'm afraid...

272
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,399
I'm afraid...

273
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,519
If I'm gone,

274
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,919
what if she isn't happy?

275
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,200
I'm afraid too.

276
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,440
Tell me,

277
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,240
what does dying feel like?

278
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,759
Actually, it's fine.

279
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,720
I'm an illegitimate child.

280
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,279
What I can give...

281
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,320
Others...

282
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,080
can surely give too.

283
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,320
She's so lovely.

284
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,720
There must be better people

285
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
to love her in my place.

286
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,200
But...

287
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,759
I love her so much.

288
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,600
Find quickly

289
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,000
the person trying to kill her.

290
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,120
Yes, sir.

291
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,200
Shen Jiaqin.

292
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,279
Do you like me?

293
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,360
If I could start over one more time,

294
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,759
could you

295
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,080
give me a chance?

296
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,399
Am I really not worth loving?

297
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,679
You are the most worthy person in the world.

298
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
I think

299
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,039
you care about me a lot.

300
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,879
Whenever you need me,

301
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,840
I will appear.

302
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,200
Shen Jiaqin.

303
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,159
I like you.

304
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,679
I love you.
