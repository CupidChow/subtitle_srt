1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,280
So you think it's this watch

2
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,560
that brought you to this timeline?

3
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,359
I really can't find any other reason.

4
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,000
Don't tell me

5
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,799
we have to go back to the road

6
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,600
and get hit by a car again?

7
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,039
Let's not do that.

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,880
Based on my acting experience,

9
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,840
things like old text messages,

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,400
photos, cassette tapes, CD players—

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,159
they can all open doors to tangled timelines.

12
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,599
And the most common prop

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,000
is a watch.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,319
Also, in my fragmented memories,

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,920
I seem to remember this watch

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,519
glowing.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,640
We won't know until we try.

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,319
Don't fiddle with it randomly.

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,840
Shen Jiaqin!

20
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,640
You've got a girl looking for you.

21
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,000
Sit down.

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,719
You dare hit me?

23
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,000
Shen Jiaqin.

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,439
Feeling tough now?

25
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,840
I was tolerating you before.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,519
I don't want to anymore.

27
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,560
What,

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,920
wanna fight?

29
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,560
You're so childish.

30
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,639
Either go back and sit down properly,

31
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,439
and study hard,

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,120
or we'll both have our parents called in.

33
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,199
I haven't seen father in a long time anyway.

34
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,919
Do you want to see him?

35
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,000
Three.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,800
Two.

37
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,599
One.

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
The dean's coming! The dean's coming!

39
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,719
What are you doing during class time?

40
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,960
Back to your seats!

41
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,240
Dean,

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,360
my stomach was hurting really bad,

43
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,120
and this senior was taking me to the infirmary.

44
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,400
So serious?

45
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,319
Then hurry, hurry to the infirmary.

46
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:37,919
Thank you.

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,680
Quick, take him.

48
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,560
Finally found the right way.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,960
So cool!

50
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,159
Did we just reverse time?

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,639
So that means

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,439
when I thought I was stuck in a time loop before,

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,639
it was all your doing?

54
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,639
What's a time loop?

55
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,240
Never mind.

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
Even if it was, he did it,

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,000
what's that got to do with the 17-year-old you?

58
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,680
Find the branching point of fate,

59
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,120
correct the mistake,

60
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,560
and then I can return to my own world,

61
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:19,759
and Yin Erfeng

62
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,120
can come back immediately.

63
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,240
Didn't get it.

64
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,120
But it sounds cool. Let's go.

65
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,439
Where to?

66
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:27,840
To get the watch.

67
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,159
Let's try again.

68
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,439
Be careful!

69
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,919
Can you do it or not?

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,879
I'm so light, and you can't even catch me?

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,159
I wasn't ready yet.

72
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,520
Auntie,

73
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,000
it's me.

74
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,080
What time is it now?

75
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,319
Why are we still here?

76
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,400
One week before exams.

77
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,240
Erfeng and I were sneaking over the wall to skip the test.

78
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,279
Sneaking over the wall to skip exams?

79
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,680
Here you go!

80
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:32,879
What are you doing?

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,839
Let me down, quick!

82
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,279
No time, just run!

83
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,319
Help!

84
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,199
Come back to class with me, now!

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,560
You can do it!

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Get down!

87
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,319
Go! Go! Go!

88
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,959
Go! Go! Go!

89
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,000
Get down now!

90
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,360
Run!

91
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,120
Run!

92
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,519
Run!

93
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,360
All of you, back to take the exam!

94
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,199
So hard.

95
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,839
So hard.

96
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,120
I haven't touched a book in ten years.

97
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,240
How could I possibly know senior high school material?

98
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
The most ridiculous part is,

99
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,639
Lin Ru actually wanted to copy from me.

100
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,480
She even asked me for answers.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,519
I told her, I don't know, I don't know,

102
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,720
and she actually got all the answers right.

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,399
All of them!

104
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
Oh, heavens!

105
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Have some plum water. Calm down.

106
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,560
You said that ten years from now,

107
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,000
you didn't know me.

108
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,560
Who was by your side then?

109
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,279
By my side...

110
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,600
I mean,

111
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,839
any friends?

112
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,399
Oh.

113
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,040
Lin Ru.

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,959
She's my best friend.

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,399
And...

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,360
Jinbai.

117
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,040
We've been together for ten years.

118
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,040
Actually, come to think of it,

119
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,279
he's been really good to me.

120
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,160
Back then, he missed his art exam for me.

121
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,720
He never became

122
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,399
the cellist he wanted to be.

123
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,959
If...

124
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,040
the path of fate

125
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,920
can change one's life,

126
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,879
what I'd most want to change

127
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,759
is for him to have never met me.

128
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:38,920
That way,

129
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,040
he wouldn't have missed his dream.

130
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,319
He wouldn't have any regrets.

131
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,439
For him,

132
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,959
that might not be a regret.

133
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,639
Not being by your side—

134
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,680
that would be the regret.

135
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,360
You little brat,

136
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,480
you're quite the charmer.

137
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,319
I brought this over.

138
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,439
Let's try again.

139
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,000
Every time we go back,

140
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,720
the days you've already lived start looping.

141
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
You live them all over again.

142
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,839
Go back once, loop once.

143
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,639
Go back once, loop once.

144
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,800
I don't mind.

145
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,319
I think it's fine.

146
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,639
High school life on infinite loop...

147
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,000
How terrifying is that?

148
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,720
It's not terrifying at all.

149
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,680
With you and Erfeng here,

150
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,079
I think it's really nice.

151
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,560
You...

152
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,759
Why are you so good to me?

153
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,279
Because you're worth it.

154
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,879
Because you're worth it.

155
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm your Auntie.

156
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,600
I'm not Yin Erfeng, okay?

157
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,040
The person you think is worth it

158
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,720
is Yin Erfeng.

159
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,559
No matter who you are,

160
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,399
you would have chosen to save me.

161
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,960
You are you.

162
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,440
The condition has been stable for so long,

163
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,919
why isn't there any improvement?

164
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,679
Now, it mostly depends on the patient's

165
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,240
own will to live.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
Is Yin Shanshan awake?

167
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:25,840
Shen Zhihe.

168
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,840
What are you doing here?

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,240
Checking if he's dead yet.

170
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
What deep-seated grudge

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
is there between you brothers

172
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,000
that makes you hound him so relentlessly?

173
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,879
Don't you know

174
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,639
his time is running out?

175
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,960
Did your boss not teach you

176
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,879
how to speak to me?

177
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,720
Let me tell you,

178
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,679
as long as he's not dead,

179
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,000
he'll always owe me.

180
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,440
Get out of my way.

181
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:18,759
Sir,

182
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,919
this was left to my boss by his mother

183
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,279
before she passed away.

184
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,879
It's very important to him.

185
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,440
Can you... still fix it?

186
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,159
This is quite an old piece.

187
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,600
It's badly damaged.

188
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,440
My boss was in a car accident.

189
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,279
He's still unconscious.

190
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,960
This watch might help wake him up.

191
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,320
Please, you have to try.

192
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,440
The watch's mechanism is strange.

193
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,240
It's different from any other watch I've seen.

194
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,879
I'll try to piece it together.

195
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,600
Okay, thank you.

196
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Let's try again, then.

197
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,879
Time reversed again!

198
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,759
Maybe if we experiment a couple more times,

199
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,559
we'll find that crucial turning point.

200
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,080
Our current point in time

201
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,639
is the first mock exam of the semester.

202
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,799
If we can go back to

203
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,799
before we even met,

204
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,639
before my mother's car accident,

205
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,200
then we could prevent the crash.

206
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,919
In theory, yes.

207
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,679
Maybe

208
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,360
if we correct the time deviation,

209
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,759
I can get back on track.

210
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,600
What's wrong?

211
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,279
What?

212
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,600
Yin Erfeng's grades are so high?

213
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,000
Then why did she skip the exam?

214
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,240
Because of me.

215
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:53,879
I didn't want to take it.

216
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,919
It's okay.

217
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,679
We have plenty of time now.

218
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,000
You can try harder.

219
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,720
Number one in the grade: Shen Jiaqin.

220
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,080
With grades like this, you didn't want to take the exam?

221
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,279
Haven't you been beaten enough?

222
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,720
I wasn't beaten.

223
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,679
After the exam,

224
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,440
Shen Zhihe went home

225
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,080
and got a severe beating from my father.

226
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,720
He ignored him for a month.

227
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,759
Rough times.

228
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,360
I think right now,

229
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,519
what we should be more concerned about

230
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,080
is your brother.

231
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,919
Come, come, come.

232
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,639
This, this.

233
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,480
One, two, three.

234
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:52,960
Give it to me.

235
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,440
Here.

236
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,240
Quick, change it. I'll put it back after.

237
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,440
How do I change it?

238
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,519
Stupid.

239
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,519
Use tape. First peel his name off,

240
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,600
then stick your own name on.

241
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,519
Simple as that.

242
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,279
What if my dad finds out?

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
If your dad finds out,

244
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
you get a beating, that's all.

245
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,159
It won't kill you. It's fine.

246
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,480
If your dad stops talking to you,

247
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,200
would you want to talk to him?

248
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,639
No.

249
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,799
Right.

250
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,440
As long as you see it that way,

251
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,039
you can reach a situation that's good

252
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,799
for both you and your brother.

253
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,639
I've realized something.

254
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,240
A lot of things become very simple

255
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,480
if you don't overthink them,

256
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,039
or can't.

257
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,159
What do you mean by that?

258
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,840
Nothing, nothing.

259
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,200
Light! There's a light!

260
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,080
Someone's coming! Someone's coming!

261
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,039
I'm sure I saw someone just now.

262
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,960
Strange.

263
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,000
Let me see if he's gone.

264
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,080
Who's there?

265
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,799
I really shouldn't work overtime.

266
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,039
Overtime makes me hear things.

267
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,639
It's a pity today, though.

268
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,960
We didn't get the watch.

269
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,159
It's fine.

270
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,759
No rush to get it.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,200
Actually, saying this might be out of line,

272
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,000
but I genuinely feel

273
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,639
like I am Yin Erfeng.

274
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,039
But actually, I'm not.

275
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,759
It's like when I'm acting.

276
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,559
I feel like I am that character,

277
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,679
but actually, I'm not.

278
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm living her life,

279
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,480
but

280
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,759
I also feel that, actually,

281
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm very, very far away from her.

282
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,960
So I have to keep telling myself

283
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,879
this is all fake,

284
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,960
none of this has anything to do with me.

285
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,639
For you celebrities,

286
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
what does acting feel like?

287
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,000
No worries about food or clothes,

288
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,759
glamorous and dazzling,

289
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,759
surrounded by admirers.

290
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,919
As long as I, Yin Shanshan, stand here

291
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,200
and wave hello to everyone,

292
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,559
people will say,

293
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,039
Shanshan, you're so beautiful!

294
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,240
You're so pretty!

295
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,159
But I know very well

296
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,080
that within that,

297
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,759
half is fear,

298
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,559
half is flattery.

299
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,679
It's just that

300
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,840
those words aren't directed at me,

301
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,279
but at my status.

302
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,679
Because

303
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,120
I'm the Nation's Little Sister, Yin Shanshan.

304
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,919
So then,

305
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,159
no matter what I do,

306
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,720
whether I do it well

307
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,360
or do it badly,

308
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,080
they'll all say

309
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,039
Well done!

310
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,720
Shanshan—

311
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,399
Call me Auntie.

312
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,640
Auntie.

313
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,680
They're right.

314
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,319
You are beautiful.

315
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,319
You are right.

316
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,480
You are the cutest.

317
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,519
In my heart,

318
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,839
you are the best

319
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,319
in the whole world.

320
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,920
Bar none.
