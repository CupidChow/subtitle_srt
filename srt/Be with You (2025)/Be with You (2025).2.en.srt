1
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,640
Do we know each other?

2
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,479
Miss Yin.

3
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,880
We do now.

4
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,719
You are a public figure.

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,079
This is a public space.

6
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,319
Occupying a public elevator...

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,879
Do you find that appropriate?

8
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:27,760
Miss Yin.

9
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,000
Currently, we do not have

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,040
a program to recycle secondhand high heels.

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,760
Please take them with you.

12
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,519
Shanshan.

13
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,120
It's about to start over there.

14
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,840
Let's hurry.

15
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:52,680
What's wrong?

16
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
Nothing, nothing.

17
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,239
Let me see.

18
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,719
Don't overthink it.

19
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,159
It's just gossip accounts talking nonsense.

20
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,919
He posted it on his own Weibo.

21
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,520
No one's twisting his words.

22
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,240
I don't care who he's with.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,000
Shh.

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,719
Keep your voice down.

25
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,360
Maybe it's just promotion for a new project.

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,039
When Jin finishes filming and returns,

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,560
he'll explain it to you himself.

28
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,439
My love life is over.

29
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,599
Okay, okay, okay.

30
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,599
There, there, don't cry.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,759
Don't cry.

32
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,759
Don't I have a press conference to attend?

33
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,439
Right.

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,439
Fix my makeup.

35
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,960
Xiao Xia.

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,120
I absolutely cannot go to the wrong room this time.

37
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,879
I must ask Jin to clarify.

38
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,680
Why did he break up with me?

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,520
Jin's room is...

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,680
1206

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,439
1206

42
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,919
1206

43
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,719
1206

44
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,319
Found it.

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,159
Jin!

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,800
Jin, open the door and tell me,

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,759
why did you break up with me?

48
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,159
We've been together for ten years.

49
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,919
How could you bear to break up with me?

50
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,719
Hey, Jin.

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,319
Why is it you?

52
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,800
I thought...

53
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,079
I'd never see you again.

54
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,439
I'm not that drunk.

55
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,639
Who are you?

56
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,560
Who are you?

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,480
Who are you?

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,519
What do you mean, who am I?

59
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,519
This is my home.

60
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,680
This is my home!

61
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Get out, you pervert!

62
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,720
What pervert?

63
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,279
Jin, open the door!

64
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,199
Hey, Jin.

65
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,519
Why is it you again?

66
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,160
What are you doing here?

67
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,639
Who am I?

68
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Hey, where are you going?

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,399
What are you doing?

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,240
Please don't break up with me.

71
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,240
I really like you.

72
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,240
I miss you so much.

73
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,959
You didn't shave today?

74
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,040
Xu Jinbai, your stubble is so prickly.

75
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,519
I'll poke you to death.

76
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,480
Let me tell you...

77
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,839
I am not Xu Jinbai.

78
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,480
About today's events...

79
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,519
Can you just pretend nothing happened?

80
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,399
What compensation do you want?

81
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,000
I can satisfy any of your requests.

82
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,000
You should leave.

83
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,439
Um...

84
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,759
No one will know you were here.

85
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
We have an obligation to protect our guests' privacy.

86
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,519
Good hotel.

87
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,839
I'll have my agent contact you tomorrow.

88
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,920
I'll film a free commercial for your hotel.

89
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,000
She's out! She's out!

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,160
Yin Shanshan! Yin Shanshan!

91
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,000
Over here! Look over here!

92
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,160
The reporters swarming... just like in the dream.

93
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,800
It's you.

94
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,639
You called these reporters.

95
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,319
Why would you do this?

96
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,920
What exactly do you want?

97
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,720
Say something!

98
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,160
Let me tell you,

99
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,399
I won't let you get away with this.

100
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,720
She's out! It really is Yin Shanshan!

101
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,519
Yin Shanshan! It's really Yin Shanshan!

102
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,759
Yin Shanshan, why are you here?

103
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,959
Shanshan, over here! Shanshan, here! Shanshan!

104
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,000
Yin Shanshan, look here! Shanshan, here!

105
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,600
Can you give us a straight answer?

106
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,399
Quick, call an ambulance!

107
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,639
What's going on now?

108
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,079
In the dream, I fell to my death from upstairs.

109
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,759
Today, I got stabbed to death.

110
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,040
Does that mean today...

111
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,800
I'm destined to die no matter what?

112
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,560
Shanshan!

113
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,680
I'm okay.

114
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,560
Did I get too drunk and have a nightmare?

115
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,480
Thankfully, Shen Jiaqin brought me back to my room.

116
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,680
That nightmare felt way too real.

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,839
Shanshan, quick, quick!

118
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,959
It's time to go to makeup!

119
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,439
Yin Shanshan!

120
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,919
Yin Shanshan, hurry up!

121
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,399
The 27th?

122
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,840
It's the 27th again?

123
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,919
Lin Ru.

124
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,240
Pinch me.

125
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,480
My lady, your highness, my ancestor,

126
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,039
are you out of your mind today?

127
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,840
If we don't leave now, we'll really be late.

128
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Just pinch me.

129
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
You're trying to kill me!

130
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,960
Do you know you've bruised me?

131
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,000
How many days will it take to heal?

132
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,039
Yin Shanshan!

133
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,000
I only know that if you're really late,

134
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,000
your prima donna reputation will be confirmed.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,480
The persona you've built will be gone forever.

136
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,679
Persona...

137
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,919
It's the persona.

138
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
It's happened twice now.

139
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,240
Whenever my image collapses, I die.

140
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,080
And then my day starts over.

141
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,960
The first time,

142
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,960
I was cornered by reporters on the rooftop.

143
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,080
I fell from the high building.

144
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,919
Then I woke up back in this bed.

145
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,960
The second time,

146
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,120
I was surrounded by reporters

147
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,240
outside a man's door,

148
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,759
and I was stabbed.

149
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:32,840
And then...

150
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,759
I was back in this bed again.

151
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,399
What kind of logic is this?

152
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,399
Restarting my life?

153
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,759
A single-day loop?

154
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,039
Lin Ru, help me think.

155
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,799
Why is this happening?

156
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,799
How can I break this cycle?

157
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,960
Alright, Shanshan.

158
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,720
Don't worry.

159
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,519
I'll get someone to help you right now.

160
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,840
I knew you'd have a way.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,039
Yes, yes, it's her.

162
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,559
She's been rambling nonsense here.

163
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,559
Please take her away and get her some treatment.

164
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,360
What's going on?

165
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,080
Lin Ru, you can't abandon me!

166
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,360
Lin Ru, I'm not sick!

167
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,320
Lin Ru!

168
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,399
Put me down!

169
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,120
Mr. Shen.

170
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,159
Preparations are complete.

171
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,279
Please inspect, President Shen.

172
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,879
The two main guests...

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,559
how many similar press conferences have they attended?

174
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
Staff, entourage, number of fans...

175
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,240
Approximately how many reporters?

176
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,559
Let me tell you.

177
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,720
Over sixty times.

178
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,080
This information is available online.

179
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,159
Why wasn't it researched?

180
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
And these vases...

181
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,080
could pose a safety risk to the guests.

182
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:56,720
Understood.

183
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,120
I'll remove them immediately.

184
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,200
This...

185
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,320
Replace it.

186
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,600
Jump.

187
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,840
Spin around.

188
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,480
Tonight,

189
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,320
one of the main guests is Yin Shanshan.

190
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,480
She's the global ambassador for CW Luxury.

191
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,039
She will definitely wear the latest

192
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,519
red carpet limited edition high heels.

193
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,360
Average height is about nine centimeters.

194
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,720
They're only for the red carpet.

195
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,080
Even you, a man, can't stand steadily in them.

196
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,360
Do you think she can stand firm?

197
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,440
Fired.

198
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,320
Mr. Shen.

199
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,639
You fired the team leader

200
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,080
in front of everyone.

201
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,879
He's the nephew of the Shen Group VP.

202
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Publicity is extremely important for the hotel.

203
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,759
Especially for Coming for You.

204
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,960
This project...

205
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,639
But tell me the truth,

206
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,039
did you invest in Coming for You

207
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,399
because of Miss Yin?

208
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,720
You agreed to the crew's harsh terms.

209
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,559
You're the Chief Assistant.

210
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,240
A future pillar of the hotel.

211
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,519
General Manager.

212
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,320
You should focus your mind on your work.

213
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,720
My new work is about to be released.

214
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,720
This time,

215
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,919
I played a mermaid in the deep sea.

216
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,080
I hope everyone will look forward to it. Thank you.

217
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,240
Please look forward to my new work.

218
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Why didn't Yin Shanshan wear the dress I prepared?

219
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,440
Was the intel wrong?

220
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,399
Shanshan, you're here.

221
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,600
Actually, friends who know me are aware

222
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,679
that I'm not very skilled at acting.

223
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,039
I'm still working hard on it.

224
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,039
I hope you can criticize me a little less.

225
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,120
Shanshan, you've been in the industry for seven years,

226
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,600
your acting hasn't improved.

227
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,320
You're called a black hole actor in the industry.

228
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,279
You're twenty-seven,

229
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,080
and can only act in silly, sweet idol dramas.

230
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,600
Have you ever reflected on yourself?

231
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,759
What's wrong with being twenty-seven?

232
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,600
As long as the role fits,

233
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
and the image suits,

234
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,399
age isn't a problem.

235
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,759
New generation actors are already winning awards.

236
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,799
You're twenty-seven and still playing the Nation's Little Sister?

237
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,519
Yin Shanshan, where did your acting spark go?

238
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,840
Do you think your current performance

239
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,679
is worthy of your fans?

240
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,879
It's been reported that you were late

241
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,960
on set and during variety show recordings.

242
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,759
Is this true?

243
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,840
Have you reflected on yourself?

244
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,080
Okay.

245
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,399
Alright, that's enough.

246
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,960
Why did you come down early?

247
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,480
Didn't you tell me before

248
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,679
that Director Chen would be meeting someone

249
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,159
in the back garden around seven?

250
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,480
I want to try for a role in Coming for You.

251
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,159
I don't want to keep playing those

252
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,519
brainless, sweet characters anymore.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
But don't we still have to meet with...

254
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,320
Don't worry.

255
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,399
I'll manage the timing. No problem.

256
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
Heaven is taking pity on me.

257
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,480
It keeps giving me chances to relive and survive.

258
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
An investor like you...

259
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,799
Many people ask to meet me.

260
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,600
This time, I must focus on my career.

261
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,720
I won't let my fans down.

262
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,120
Win over Director Chen.

263
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,879
Let's go.

264
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,240
This time, no prima donna behavior.

265
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
No lovesick foolishness.

266
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,200
No jinx named Shen Jiaqin.

267
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,120
I'm sure to successfully win over Director Chen.

268
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,000
Land the role.

269
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,639
Bid farewell to silly, sweet roles.

270
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,919
When it comes to art,

271
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,720
I'm, well, all-encompassing.

272
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,759
My shooting style is basically...

273
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,120
click-clack, a-click-clack.

274
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,360
It's you again.
