1
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:41,520
Shanshan

2
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,439
To me, you're the best...

3
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
in the whole world.

4
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,000
Absolutely...

5
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,600
the best.

6
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,159
Are your eyes bothering you?

7
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,480
I-I'll get you some eye drops.

8
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,040
N-No, no! My eyes are fine.

9
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,640
I mean...

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,719
I already have eye drops.

11
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,319
I...

12
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,959
I-I'll see you tomorrow.

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,680
Oh my god.

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,159
Oh my god.

15
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,680
Yin Shanshan, how could you close your eyes?!

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,560
He's just a kid!

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,519
He's only seventeen!

18
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,840
You're ten years older than him!

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,319
How dare you close your eyes!

20
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,599
What were you thinking?

21
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,879
You're insane!

22
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,000
My god.

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Yin Shanshan, you've truly lost it!

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,000
Still rehearsing lines so late?

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
It's just a school audition.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,959
Why so nervous?

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,359
What audition?

28
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,000
This.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,080
A crew is filming at our school,

30
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,080
and they want students as extras.

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
A chance to get on camera,

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
change your destiny.

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,000
Acting isn't so easy.

34
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,639
Why are you so into it?

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,240
Wait, isn't this...

36
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,639
that shoot I participated in during high school?

37
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,439
When is it?

38
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,240
Tomorrow, I think.

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,319
Do what you want.

40
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm not going.

41
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,039
I'd be too embarrassed.

42
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,560
Thanks.

43
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:53,960
What's this?

44
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,240
This event seems pointless.

45
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,240
I participated back then too.

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,360
I auditioned for one scene,

47
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,039
and got scouted by an agency.

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,159
Became an actor later.

49
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,039
Actually, this event seems pretty good.

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,960
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,039
According to the timeline,

52
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,319
you should know about this.

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,960
Why are you asking me?

54
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,639
Erfeng did participate.

55
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,560
She just didn't get picked.

56
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,759
How is that possible?

57
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,599
When I auditioned,

58
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,639
my acting was a mess,

59
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,639
but the agency still

60
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,840
chased me for my contact.

61
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,159
Was she even worse than me?

62
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,639
What topic did you choose?

63
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,479
I think it was...

64
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,800
Farewell.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She was the same back then.

66
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,039
Cried her eyes out during the audition.

67
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,080
Everyone else had finished,

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,159
and she was still crying.

69
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,400
Cut! Cut! Cut!

70
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,360
When I got there,

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,919
she was still crying.

72
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,360
No wonder.

73
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,240
An uncontrollable actor

74
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,439
is no use to a crew.

75
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,439
Anyway, seeing her so upset

76
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,839
made me feel terrible.

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,399
Once I return to my own world,

78
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,199
everything will be back on track.

79
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,120
Not so fast.

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,920
Before you go, help me with one thing.

81
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,199
What is it?

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,199
Hello, teachers.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,839
I'm Yin Erfeng.

84
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm still a student.

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,839
Although I'm not entirely sure

86
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
if I truly love acting,

87
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,240
I'd like to give it a try.

88
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,040
I hope you can give me a chance.

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,360
Let us know when you're ready.

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,959
Farewell again.

91
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,399
Do you have a crush on me?

92
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,480
You...

93
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,680
do you have a crush on me?

94
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,519
Lately,

95
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,399
spending time with you at school

96
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,639
has made me feel

97
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,560
something different for you.

98
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,399
But the truth is,

99
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,920
I'm a person with no tomorrow.

100
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,639
I don't know when...

101
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,199
I might just disappear.

102
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,240
Maybe everything we're going through

103
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,759
is just a dream.

104
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,680
Maybe my disappearance

105
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
won't matter to you at all.

106
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,959
Or maybe...

107
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,680
it will make you sad.

108
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,399
Maybe...

109
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,920
you'll forget me.

110
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,160
But before that day comes,

111
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,759
I still want to tell you how I feel.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,279
Shen Jiaqin,

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,480
I like you.

114
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,759
So much raw talent!

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,439
You,

116
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,720
don't seem like a student.

117
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
You're like a seasoned actor

118
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,759
with seven or eight years of experience.

119
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,800
Thank you, teacher.

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,720
With me on the job,

121
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,160
success is guaranteed!

122
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,360
Awesome.

123
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,399
What's wrong?

124
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,959
It's just... feels kinda magical.

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,399
I acted for ten years before.

126
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,680
But everyone always said,

127
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,519
After all these years acting,

128
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,439
you're still so bad.

129
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,480
But today,

130
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,160
they all said I'm very experienced,

131
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
a really good actor.

132
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,079
Don't care what others say.

133
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,079
Those minor directors don't know how to direct.

134
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,839
I think your acting is the best.

135
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:17,920
Really.

136
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,160
The best.

137
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,560
Alright, kid, let's go.

138
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,720
Go where?

139
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,839
I delivered on my promise.

140
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,200
You gotta treat me to some fun.

141
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,159
My treat.

142
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,000
So what?

143
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,240
How is it?

144
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,919
And also,

145
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,720
Eat up. There's plenty.

146
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,120
Slow down, don't choke.

147
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,799
You know,

148
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,039
this kind of carefree time

149
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,399
is so rare for me.

150
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,600
You have no idea what I went through

151
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
to keep my figure before.

152
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
If you want to eat, eat more.

153
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,080
Fill the belly, then we'll ride the Ferris wheel.

154
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,759
Call it a night after that.

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,679
From then on,

156
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,159
we'll part ways forever.

157
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,159
Eating, huh?

158
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,919
Sister brought the little brother to the amusement park.

159
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,919
Is this a stuffed animal you won for Shen Jiaqin?

160
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,879
What about it?

161
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,519
You little brats came too, didn't you?

162
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,919
What we play

163
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,200
are real man's games.

164
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,039
Yeah!

165
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,159
Come on! You dare to try?

166
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,080
Yeah, give it a shot!

167
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,799
You wanna compete?

168
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,039
If you lose,

169
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,879
you can never bully Shen Jiaqin again.

170
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,399
And if we win?

171
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,159
I haven't thought of that yet.

172
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
You're such a cheater.

173
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,039
Totally.

174
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,399
So, you in or not?

175
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,480
Fine, let's compete!

176
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,840
Let's do it!

177
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,360
Let's go!

178
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,840
Go!

179
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,759
Who's scared?

180
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,200
Go!

181
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,840
Go!

182
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,080
Speak. A bet's a bet.

183
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,679
Why revised my test papers?

184
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,440
Don't be a smart aleck next time.

185
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,639
So good.

186
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,600
Thank you.

187
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,799
It was nothing.

188
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,159
If... and I mean if,

189
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,039
if I can leave,

190
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,080
if Erfeng can come back,

191
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
you must tell her something.

192
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,679
Later, when she's acting,

193
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,159
she'll meet a female lead's mother

194
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,600
who gives her a hard time.

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,879
But don't be afraid.

196
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:31,799
Because...

197
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,240
after I become famous,

198
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,600
that girl

199
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,480
will only be fit to play my supporting roles.

200
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,440
Sounds like you hold a grudge.

201
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,039
She gave you a hard time, didn't she?

202
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,559
That time a director

203
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,120
wanted to give me an extra shot,

204
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,639
her mother was totally against it,

205
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,879
causing all sorts of trouble.

206
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,039
Yelling and making a scene on set.

207
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,200
Made it so awkward for me.

208
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,720
Luckily, Jinbai was there.

209
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,200
Otherwise,

210
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,559
I wouldn't have known what to do.

211
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,879
Jinbai... is he the one you said

212
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,879
you'd be with after graduation?

213
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:14,480
Mm-hmm.

214
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,399
But later...

215
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,240
we broke up.

216
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,200
Why?

217
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,279
Because we grew up.

218
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,360
Because we changed.

219
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,399
Or maybe... just got tired.

220
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,919
I don't know.

221
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,559
There were all sorts of reasons.

222
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,399
But I never dared to ask.

223
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,679
The whole time,

224
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,879
I was the one following his pace,

225
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,759
trying to keep up.

226
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,120
But...

227
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,840
as I kept going...

228
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,480
I just couldn't keep up anymore.

229
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
But if it were me,

230
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,519
no matter if I could catch up or not,

231
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,720
if it's someone I love,

232
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,720
I'd do my best to stay by her side.

233
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,200
Shen Jiaqin.

234
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,960
Don't tell me you're falling for me?

235
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,039
I...

236
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,279
You better not fall for me.

237
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,360
I...

238
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,679
might seem warm and fun,

239
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,200
and interesting,

240
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,039
and also...

241
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,720
pretty likable.

242
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,480
But actually,

243
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,279
people who've known me for a long time

244
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,120
get annoyed with me.

245
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,600
They start to dislike me a bit.

246
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,399
So,

247
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,679
right now, at this stage,

248
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,320
half-familiar,

249
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,039
it's just perfect.

250
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,120
So beautiful.

251
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,960
Mom.

252
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,639
Ms. Yin.

253
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,159
Shanshan.

254
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,360
Mom.

255
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:56,879
Shanshan, honey.

256
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,440
Doctor!

257
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,240
Auntie, I'll get the doctor!

258
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,879
Doctor! She's awake!

259
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,519
I thought...

260
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,160
I'd never see you again.

261
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,480
Don't talk nonsense.

262
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,480
Doctor! Doctor!

263
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,079
Help her sit up.

264
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,880
Let me check her.

265
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,279
No major physical issues.

266
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,640
Rest a bit and you can be discharged.

267
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,279
Luckily, you're awake.

268
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,440
Fortunately

269
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,480
Car accident?

270
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,279
Where's Shen Jiaqin?

271
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,039
He's more badly injured than you.

272
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,440
He's still unconscious.

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,759
I need to see him.
