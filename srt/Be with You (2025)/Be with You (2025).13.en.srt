1
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,719
What kind of scripts do you think

2
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,400
the other groups have?

3
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,920
Jinbai.

4
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,359
I don't want to follow the script

5
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,159
and act out some reunited lovers,

6
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,439
sweet and lovey-dovey scene with you.

7
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,079
You suddenly broke up with me

8
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,439
without any explanation,

9
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,879
disappeared for so long,

10
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,239
and the next time I heard about you

11
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,200
was your official announcement.

12
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,120
Did you ever consider my feelings?

13
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,959
Shanshan.

14
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,480
But you should know

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,200
that was a rumor arranged by the production team.

17
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,280
Then can you tell me

18
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,599
what really happened to you back then?

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,599
I don't want to talk about it.

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,680
But I really joined this show for you.

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,800
Then why

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,280
can't you just tell me the truth?

23
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,919
Is it so hard for you to tell the truth?

24
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,199
You don't tell me anything,

25
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,280
you don't share anything with me.

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,319
Now you're back safe and sound,

27
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,719
and you want me to act like nothing happened,

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
to perform sweetness

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,639
with you on this variety show.

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,439
I can't do it.

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,639
Shanshan.

32
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,360
You've been crying for so long.

33
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,159
Maybe hydrate a bit?

34
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm not crying.

35
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,439
Fine.

36
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,680
I'm the one who's crying.

37
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,439
Then please have some water.

38
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,680
Two green plums are better.

39
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,360
Whenever I feel down,

40
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,800
I like to drink water this way.

41
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,560
You drink it this way too?

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,879
I was the one who taught you this method.

43
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,560
The plum is sour,

44
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,039
it makes you produce a lot of saliva.

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,000
Just drink the plum water,

46
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,039
and as you drink,

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you won't feel like crying anymore.

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,039
Shen Jiaqin.

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,000
Did we know each other in high school?

50
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,560
No.

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,399
Then how did you know I used to climb walls?

52
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,560
How did you know I love takoyaki?

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
How did you know

54
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,759
I love drinking plum water?

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,279
I don't know.

56
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,680
You've been back to the past too?

57
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,360
No.

58
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,720
Then you have a crush on me!

59
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,040
Absolutely not.

60
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,240
Do you have a crush on me?

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,000
No!

62
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,199
Why don't you have a crush?

63
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:42,600
You have a crush on me, it's...

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,040
it's not embarrassing!

65
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,279
I said no!

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why won't you admit it?

67
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,560
You do! You have a crush on me!

68
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,040
If you keep this up,

69
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,079
I'll fight back!

70
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,360
Admit it!

71
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,560
Admit what?

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,600
There's nothing to admit!

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
How can there be nothing?

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,720
Why won't you admit it?

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,360
Come here!

76
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,120
I said I don't!

77
00:04:59,319 --> 00:04:59,839
Get over here!

78
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,199
You have a crush on me!

79
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:02,879
I really don't!

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
How can you not!

81
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,480
A new day of dates is starting!

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,079
This time, we'll publicly send out date invitations.

83
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,519
To the person you have feelings for,

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,720
hand them an invitation ticket!

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,199
I said

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,560
I would always choose you.

87
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,040
Two tickets.

88
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,560
Forced date.

89
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,399
I...

90
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,040
Shen Jiaqin,

91
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,040
you're coming with me right now.

92
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,600
Big Sis, are you crazy?

93
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,879
You just broke up a couple

94
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,759
that was formed yesterday!

95
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,800
The live stream is going wild with criticism!

96
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,759
Go back!

97
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,759
Say you were acting!

98
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,600
Come with me.

99
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,199
Right here.

100
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,680
We worked together

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,839
to get you into the infirmary.

102
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,600
You were being bullied by classmates,

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,079
standing pitifully at the door.

104
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,600
It was me! Me!

105
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,040
I slammed a book down

106
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,560
and told them,

107
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,279
No one is allowed to bully Shen Jiaqin anymore!

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,360
Remember now?

109
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,959
Do you remember?

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
What did you all do

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,600
while I was away?

112
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,680
Daydreaming?

113
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,399
You can daydream about him too?

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,399
This is the spot.

115
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,399
We always used to sneak over this wall

116
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,199
to skip exams.

117
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,959
You remember, right?

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,480
Forget it.

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,360
I really can't climb walls anymore.

120
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,680
Do you have a crush on me?

121
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,000
She has a crush on me!

122
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,079
Mine is an open crush on you!

123
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,800
And besides, what decent person

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,439
still climbs walls at twenty?

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,240
See?

126
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,079
I didn't forget.

127
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,040
Let's go.

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,319
Yin Shanshan!

129
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,199
Get down here now!

130
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
What are you doing here?

131
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,399
If I didn't come,

132
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,480
you'd have turned the world upside down!

133
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,680
Now everyone knows you have a crush on Shen Jiaqin

134
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,720
and an open thing for Xu Jinbai!

135
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,480
Okay, okay, okay.

136
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,480
Don't worry,

137
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,160
we'll cooperate fully in post-production.

138
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:01,839
Okay, got it!

139
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,560
Bye for now!

140
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,560
Well?

141
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,079
They kicked me off the show.

142
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,079
Actually,

143
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,560
maybe it's for the best.

144
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,680
Lin Ru,

145
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,680
let me tell you everything, okay?

146
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,199
Ever since the wrap party,

147
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,160
I've been stuck in an infinite loop.

148
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
I finally got out,

149
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,759
got into a car accident,

150
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,039
and then I went back to the past.

151
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,840
I even met Shen Jiaqin.

152
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,360
You've really lost it, haven't you?

153
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,279
I'm not crazy! It's all true!

154
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,080
Abandoning your Nation's Little Sister persona

155
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
to act like a lunatic in front of everyone—

156
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,399
is this fun for you?

157
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,879
Do you know what people online

158
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,759
are saying about you now?

159
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,000
Pioneer of Unhinged Literature.

160
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,799
Your shipping fans are called the Bizarre Shippers.

161
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,080
They'll ship anything,

162
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,840
just for a balanced diet.

163
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,759
Shanshan,

164
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,759
I don't know

165
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,480
how many years ahead your mental state is,

166
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,960
but I know if you keep this up,

167
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
my mental state will really collapse.

168
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,919
I'm not messing around!

169
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,799
Do you like that Shen Jiaqin?

170
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,399
I just really want to figure out

171
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,320
if everything I've been through lately

172
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,080
is really connected to him.

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,879
Yin Shanshan,

174
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,960
if you keep this up,

175
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,200
no matter how much Jinbai and I care about you,

176
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
no matter how much we want the best for you,

177
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,200
we'll get exhausted too.

178
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,399
But you...

179
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,679
you have no idea

180
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,960
what I've been through recently.

181
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,559
And do you know what we've been through?

182
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,879
Recording continues tomorrow.

183
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,759
Jinbai insisted to the production team

184
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,080
that he'd only choose you for the date.

185
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,000
So the production team had no choice

186
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,159
but to keep you on.

187
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,279
They have one condition

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,679
This time, pick the right couple.

189
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,480
Your official partner is Xu Jinbai.

190
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,000
If you want to stay on this show,

191
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,799
follow the production team's arrangements.

192
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,120
Yin Shanshan is clearly remembering

193
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,360
the things you two experienced before.

194
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,759
How long do you think we can keep this up?

195
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,840
You know

196
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,600
my watch can travel to the past.

197
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
But this ability

198
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,519
was taught to me by Shanshan.

199
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:48,960
When?

200
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:49,919
In middle school.

201
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,399
Second year of high school.

202
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,960
Erfeng suddenly told me one day

203
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,360
that she wasn't the Yin Erfeng I knew,

204
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,080
but was Yin Shanshan from ten years in the future.

205
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,240
She said she

206
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
had traveled through time,

207
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,039
probably because of my watch.

208
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,440
Then I tried countless times,

209
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,360
and it actually worked.

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,360
So does she know about

211
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,720
your high school experiences?

212
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
She only has fragmented memories from going back.

213
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,679
And I didn't admit it.

214
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,080
Why not

215
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,799
tell her?

216
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,519
Besides, how can you keep this hidden?

217
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,080
She'll know if she tries your watch!

218
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,240
Oh no.

219
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,440
When Shanshan chose me for the date,

220
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,240
I figured

221
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,440
she'd ask me about the time travel.

222
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,240
I specifically turned off my microphone.

223
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,480
But it was being livestreamed the whole time!

224
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,559
Exactly.

225
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,279
I didn't know the microphone

226
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,879
was remotely controlled.

227
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,679
It caused the biggest live broadcast audio accident

228
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,120
in dating show history.

229
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,200
And you're still sponsoring it?

230
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,320
Are you stupid?

231
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,480
Who proposed this variety show?

232
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,200
It was Shen Zhihe's idea.

233
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Shen Zhihe?

234
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,320
He's coming for me.

235
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,279
I don't want to drag Shanshan into this

236
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,320
because of our issues.

237
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,720
Plus,

238
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,799
I want to see if Xu Jinbai

239
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,600
truly loves her.

240
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,919
It's done.

241
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,720
Thank you.

242
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,039
I'll take the rest.

243
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,159
This... this...

244
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:27,679
You...

245
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,480
Let's go.

246
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:29,279
I want them all.

247
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,960
Okay, okay, okay.

248
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,480
Stop causing trouble for me, okay?

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Just follow the script.

250
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,440
I don't want to be chased online by haters

251
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,799
calling me two-timer.

252
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,200
What script?

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,519
Go find your official partner!

254
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,759
Which official?

255
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,080
Who's in charge?

256
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,279
I... I really don't know.

257
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,240
Why did you even come on this dating show?

258
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,159
So,

259
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,759
Xia Yan paired with you is the pure innocent sweetheart,

260
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,000
the perfect match for the business tycoon.

261
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,759
She's innocent?

262
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,159
You know her well.

263
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,159
She specifically designed this persona

264
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,679
with her team for this show.

265
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,639
Glamorous socialite on stage,

266
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,519
pure innocent sweetheart off stage.

267
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,519
The main appeal is the

268
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,039
contrast between on and off stage.

269
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,919
You know a lot.

270
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,840
Last night, Lin Ru

271
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,039
forced me to study dating show tropes.

272
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,480
I even got dark circles from staying up.

273
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,519
So now, every move they make,

274
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,759
every word, every glance, I can tell

275
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,679
exactly where the story is going.

276
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,600
So impressive?

277
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,879
That's called professionalism.

278
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:37,799
So,

279
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,320
you and Xu Jinbai

280
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,480
are the official couple?

281
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,759
Of course.

282
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,240
We're the male and female leads of Coming for You.

283
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,759
Of course we're the official couple.

284
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,559
Is it real or an act?

285
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,000
Of course it's real.

286
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,799
I'm a professional actress.

287
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,039
Genuinely real.

288
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,799
Then what's your persona as a couple?

289
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,000
The takoyaki?

290
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,320
That's the nostalgic memory we designed.

291
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,679
We're going for

292
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,799
the childhood sweethearts who missed their chance trope.

293
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,240
Shanshan,

294
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,639
been looking for you.

295
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,559
Time to film the next segment.

296
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,360
Go touch up your makeup.

297
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,080
Okay.

298
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,279
Lu Yun.

299
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,720
I can't hold back anymore.

300
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,840
Talk to the production team for me.

301
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,080
All guests, please turn around.

302
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:35,759
All guests,

303
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,799
please look at your assigned partner.

304
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,039
I've changed my mind.

305
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,320
I've never been in a relationship either.

306
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,399
I lost my partner.

307
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,039
Mind if I join you guys?

308
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,720
Don't mind.

309
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,879
I mind.

310
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,360
Okay then.

311
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,799
Shanshan,

312
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,399
how about just you and me

313
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,440
switch to the second round?

314
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,720
No need.

315
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,120
I'll switch with Xia Yan.

316
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,679
You three can sit together.

317
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,559
Actually,

318
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,360
the person I most want to ride the Ferris wheel with

319
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,320
is someone I shared

320
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
beautiful memories with.

321
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,200
Why are you so good to me?

322
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Because you're worth it.

323
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,279
But it's a pity

324
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,399
that maybe I was too willful back then.

325
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,559
So,

326
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,639
they're all denying that past.

327
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,279
It's okay.

328
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,440
I'll ride alone.

329
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,320
I want to think carefully

330
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:11,960
about those

331
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,879
memories that were once a secret.

332
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,080
Get away!

333
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,799
Stop crowding me!

334
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,799
Okay, okay, okay.

335
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,440
Let's not fight over it.

336
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,039
Right, no fighting.

337
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,840
No grabbing.

338
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,879
We're all gentlemen here.

339
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,759
One at a time.

340
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,159
Okay?

341
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,000
Right, one at a time.

342
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:56,840
Exactly.

343
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,240
All's fair in love and war, you know?

344
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:00,759
Gentlemen?

345
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,319
What are you doing up here?

346
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Just my luck.

347
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,319
To run into two guys

348
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,279
One breaks up and disappears,

349
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,480
won't say a word.

350
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,640
The other,

351
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,200
plays dumb,

352
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,000
insists on pretending he doesn't know me.

353
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,440
Why is the feed gone?

354
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,599
Why no signal?

355
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,480
Someone, go check the situation.

356
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,599
Why is it always those two?

357
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,559
What's happening now?

358
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,279
Director!

359
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,119
Sorry, Director.

360
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,599
I'm here to supervise everyone.

361
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,440
Please turn off their equipment.

362
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,920
And the livestream is no longer permitted.

363
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,240
Yes.

364
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,079
As the show's biggest sponsor,

365
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:47,880
I hope everyone

366
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,240
can respect my boss, okay?

367
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,039
During work hours,

368
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,160
you can openly slack off,

369
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
right? How fun is that?

370
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,200
Right? Let's have fun!

371
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,640
Get hyped!

372
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,119
Boss, you can do it!

373
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
You think you traveled to the past, right?

374
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,359
I caused it.
