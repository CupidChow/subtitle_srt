1
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,479
So I'm back again.

2
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,280
Since I can start over...

3
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,679
What do I have to hold back for?

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,760
What is there to fear?

5
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,439
Let me run wild...

6
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,000
in this endless loop!

7
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,239
What are you doing?

8
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,439
I've had it with you!

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,359
Let's see you bully me again!

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,599
Yin Shanshan, are you out of your mind?

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,319
You're the crazy one!

12
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,040
Get over here!

13
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,799
Come here! Try throwing your drink again!

14
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,079
Get over here! You, come here!

15
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,560
Everyone, please cooperate.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,599
Stop filming! No recording!

17
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,840
Hush money can be arranged.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,560
We will split it.

19
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,760
Boss Zhao...

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
You nasty old man!

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,359
You're horrible!

22
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,200
Do you even have a daughter?

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,680
Take a look at yourself in the mirror!

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,879
I have a son...

25
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,920
Oh, a son, big deal!

26
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,920
I'm not... I'm not that drunk!

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,879
Yin Shanshan, let me tell you...

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
I'm going to blacklist you!

29
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:51,920
What are you doing?

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,400
Shanshan!

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,040
What are you doing?

32
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,719
What are you doing?

33
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,439
Stop her!

34
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,360
Yin Shanshan, oh Yin Shanshan...

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,439
Making two enemies in one day...

36
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,560
You're really something.

37
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,879
Xiao Xia, come back to the company with me.

38
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,759
Tell the PR team to be on standby tonight.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,759
Monitor public opinion.

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,520
In case Cao Wen and Boss Zhao try something sneaky.

41
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,960
Okay, Sister Lin Ru.

42
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,199
Keep it down.

43
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,400
If you wake her up,

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,520
she'll start causing trouble again.

45
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,719
Sorry, sorry.

46
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,439
Open up, Shen Jiaqin!

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,840
Open the door!

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,400
What do you want?

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,639
Wait...

50
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,159
Are you busy?

51
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,639
Give me back my camera!

52
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,919
You followed her all the way to her room door.

53
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,919
What were you trying to shoot?

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,039
Assistant Lu! Assistant Lu!

55
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,400
Throw him out!

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,680
If I see him again,

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
you're all fired!

58
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,240
Yes.

59
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,039
Give me back my camera!

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm going to have a serious talk with you today!

61
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,759
Am I really not worth loving?

62
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,919
Jinbai doesn't like me...

63
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,960
Because we've been together for ten years already.

64
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,520
Ten years... we're sick of each other.

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,520
I can understand that.

66
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,199
But you...

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Why don't you like me?

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,879
I already confessed to you!

69
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,879
How dare you not like me!

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,759
That's enough.

71
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,479
You're so handsome...

72
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,480
Put me down.

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,360
Let me tell you...

74
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,759
I'm not that... that... what's-his-name Bai!

75
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,720
Aren't you Shen Jiaqin?

76
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,360
I didn't mistake you for someone else.

77
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,399
I came here today to ask you...

78
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,920
Am I really not worth loving?

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
He's not worth it.

80
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,720
You are the most worthy person in the world.

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,519
Boss, you're absolutely right.

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,120
Tell me...

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,439
Why am I not worth loving?

84
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,879
Answer me!

85
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,399
I, Yin Shanshan...

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,160
am the most deserving of love...

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,839
in this world, in this entire universe!

88
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,519
Right?

89
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,680
Have some water.

90
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,519
Every day I open my eyes...

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,160
it's the same room, the same place...

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,360
the same world.

93
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,800
It's terrifying.

94
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
Why is my life so miserable?

95
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,079
Why is it so hard for me?

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,399
Why am I someone with no tomorrow?

97
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,439
Why?

98
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,480
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,319
It won't happen again.

100
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,759
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,920
Why are you apologizing to me?

102
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,879
My time loop...

103
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,160
It really is connected to you?

104
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,720
It's because of your obsession.

105
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,480
Because you like me.

106
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,319
How can I fulfill your wish?

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,279
A kiss.

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
What are you screaming for?

109
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,839
Why are you here?

110
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,399
Aren't you supposed to be outside the door, calling "It's a wrap!"

111
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,199
waking me up?

112
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,439
Why are you here watching me?

113
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,600
Just how much did you drink last night?

114
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,319
Lady,

115
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,079
we wrapped yesterday.

116
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,480
As for why I'm in your room...

117
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
First, last night...

118
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,720
I was the one who cleaned up...

119
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,759
your mess all night.

120
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:45,759
Second...

121
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,600
I was the one who brought you back to your room.

122
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,800
The 28th?

123
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,800
The 28th!

124
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,519
Lin Ru!

125
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,959
Today is the 28th?

126
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Yesterday was the 27th.

127
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,560
Today is the 28th?

128
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Obviously.

129
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,160
Does it hurt?

130
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
You brat!

131
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
It hurts! It hurts!

132
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,319
Lin Ru, you know what?

133
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,319
I'm not dreaming.

134
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,240
My dream is over.

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,160
My time loop has ended.

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,279
Yin Shanshan,

137
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,759
what nonsense are you talking about?

138
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,360
Let me tell you something...

139
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,600
Don't think you can avoid a scolding...

140
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,360
by pretending to feel guilty...

141
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,279
or acting crazy!

142
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,600
Let me ask you...

143
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,159
Last night, instead of sleeping in your room...

144
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,639
what were you doing in Shen Jiaqin's room?

145
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,279
I went to Shen Jiaqin's room?

146
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,600
Yeah, and you threw up all over him.

147
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,120
I don't even want to talk about it.

148
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,600
When Xiao Xia and I entered the room...

149
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,759
the smell was...

150
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,279
So... how is he now?

151
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,759
Look at you, being considerate.

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
He's fine, of course.

153
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,799
But he's really something else.

154
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,919
The room was a complete mess because of you,

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,559
but he insisted on sleeping there all night.

156
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,639
Just refused to change rooms.

157
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,559
I don't get it.

158
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Do you think I should...

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,960
go apologize to him?

160
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
Apologize? No way!

161
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
Hurry up, get out of bed and pack your things.

162
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,440
We need to go to the company.

163
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,279
We have to explain to that baldy Zhang...

164
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,360
your outrageous behavior from yesterday.

165
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Stop mumbling!

166
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,039
Hurry up!

167
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,879
Come on, take this down.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,759
Does she still want this version?

169
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,480
No, throw it away. It's fine, I'll clean up.

170
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,759
Give it to me.

171
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,200
Over there, there's more over there.

172
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,440
Come with me over here.

173
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,559
Coming.

174
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,080
Adjust this position a bit.

175
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,080
And these few, these ones here.

176
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
Throw this one away too. Okay.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,080
Okay, I'll sort it out.

178
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,840
What's the meaning of this?

179
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,919
What's with this poster?

180
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
Shanshan has always been the centerpiece.

181
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Who told you to take it down?

182
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,919
Sister Lin Ru, it was the boss's idea.

183
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,399
We're just following orders.

184
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,120
Then you hang it back up properly!

185
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,399
Don't hang it crooked!

186
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,279
When the wall starts to crumble, everyone gives it a push.

187
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,879
Alright, alright.

188
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,799
They're just collecting a paycheck.

189
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,879
No point getting angry with them.

190
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,279
Xiao Xia, handle this.

191
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,200
Shanshan...

192
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,159
Are you really going to look for Xia Yan?

193
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,080
I'll look for

194
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,759
whom pays the salary

195
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,039
I'm the boss!

196
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,799
or you are?

197
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,039
That Yin Shanshan just rides on her high popularity...

198
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,080
Do they even see me...

199
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
as the boss?

200
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,399
I'm promoting new talent now.

201
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,720
As for you...

202
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,240
If you want to stay, stay.

203
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,799
If not, get out!

204
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,600
I'm going to show her right now...

205
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,000
Whoever I want to promote...

206
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,279
is the company's...

207
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,480
top star!

208
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,120
Then congratulations to Xia Yan...

209
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,519
for becoming the company's new top star.

210
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,360
I just wonder...

211
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,960
if she can handle the spotlight I bring...

212
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,399
or make as much money as I do.

213
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,159
If she can't, you'll be pretty upset.

214
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,240
Right?

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,879
I told you, you should drink less coffee.

216
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,440
The money I make is enough for you to drink some decent tea.

217
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:28,320
It's a misunderstanding.

218
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,200
Lin Ru...

219
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm here.

220
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,440
I've prepared some tea for everyone.

221
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,879
I know you worked all night, you've worked hard.

222
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,720
This is a bonus...

223
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,799
from Shanshan's own pocket.

224
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,240
Thank you.

225
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,039
Thank you for your hard work.

226
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,759
Thank you.

227
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,440
Here, thank you.

228
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,679
Why is there one extra?

229
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,000
Shanshan, yes, yes, yes...

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,320
That's not what I meant.

231
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,559
Whether in the past, present, or future...

232
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,480
you will always be the company's top star.

233
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,120
Is it just because Xia Yan...

234
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,919
landed a movie with Director Chen?

235
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,159
I have to show some support too, right?

236
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,200
But what if...

237
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,600
the movie was mine?

238
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,360
When the wall crumbles, everyone pushes.

239
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,039
If I'd known it would be like this...

240
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,720
I'd rather have stayed in the time loop...

241
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,679
enjoying life.

242
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,320
They're businessmen. They promote whoever brings profit.

243
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,440
Shanshan, are you okay?

244
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:33,840
I'm fine.

245
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,080
Then I'll create value...

246
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,440
so that one day he'll get down on his knees...

247
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
and beg me for a share of the profits.

248
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,399
The future potential is limitless.

249
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,039
Before I entered the office just now...

250
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,879
I overheard them saying Jinbai got injured.

251
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,679
You must have heard wrong.

252
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,799
Isn't Xu Jinbai filming on set?

253
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,960
Right... we've already broken up.

254
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,720
He has someone new now.

255
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,840
When such a big thing happened to me this time...

256
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,440
he didn't even show up.

257
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,679
You should spend your time thinking about work.

258
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,919
But then again...

259
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,120
there hasn't been much new work lately.

260
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,399
Is Shen Jiaqin really...

261
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,440
investing in Coming for You?

262
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,120
I heard the talks went well last night.

263
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,159
It's pretty much confirmed.

264
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,039
But I heard that project might be set for Xia Yan.

265
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,240
Well, before Xia Yan signs the contract...

266
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,240
I might still have a chance, right?

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,720
Of course.

268
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,399
Then Coming for You...

269
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,159
will be my next job.

270
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,799
Lin Ru...

271
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,279
Find out Director Chen's recent schedule for me.

272
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,080
Don't worry.

273
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,240
Leave it to me.

274
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,120
Okay, I'll head back to the hotel to prepare.

275
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,799
Notify me as soon as you have news about Director Chen.

276
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,159
Get home safe.

277
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,000
Is she... okay now?

278
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,600
Don't worry. With her personality...

279
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,799
she gets stronger with every setback.

280
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,840
Please, take good care of her for me.

281
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,159
That's my job anyway.

282
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,799
What's going on with your Weibo?

283
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,000
Boss Zhang...

284
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,279
had my social media accounts taken away.

285
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,559
A lot of media are speculating something happened to me.

286
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,519
He wants to use this...

287
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,840
to divert the media's attention.

288
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,799
Shanshan must be very upset.

289
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,240
But this time...

290
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,000
her calmness worries me a little.

291
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,759
When I get back, I'll make it up to her properly.

292
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
Why do you have to keep it from her?

293
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,720
You know what her temper is like.

294
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,480
If she knew the truth, who knows...

295
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,039
how she would confront Boss Zhang.

296
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,320
It would only harm her own career.

297
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,679
What good would it do?

298
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,440
I'd rather she be well protected...

299
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,639
and never have to grow up.

300
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,720
A Ru, until my injury heals...

301
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,720
take care of her.

302
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,240
Don't worry.

303
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,200
This setting

304
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,080
is perfect for

305
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,320
the scene where Lu Jin confesses but then faints.

306
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,440
Tell the set department to set it up in advance.

307
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:18,759
Also...

308
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,639
Hello, Director Chen.

309
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,519
I'm the actress Yin Shanshan.

310
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,360
Could I trouble you for ten minutes of your time?

311
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,080
Where were we?

312
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,240
Director, just five minutes! Five minutes!

313
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,399
Yin Shanshan, right?

314
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,159
I've seen your work.

315
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,559
Purely in terms of acting...

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,320
you're not my ideal Lu Jin.

317
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,159
Director...

318
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,879
I've been studying the script carefully lately.

319
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,120
I think I'm actually very suited...

320
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,159
for the role of Lu Jin.

321
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,279
How so?

322
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,159
Right now,

323
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,399
I can really understand

324
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,159
Lu Jin's feeling

325
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,120
of despair, not knowing if there will be a tomorrow.

326
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,639
For this,

327
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,519
I've specially prepared a scene.

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,720
Mr. Shen.

329
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,159
Director Chen, thank you for your hard work.

330
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,120
Long time no see.

331
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,120
Long time no see.

332
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,519
Oh, right.

333
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,039
Perfect timing. This is the actress Yin Shanshan.

334
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:21,960
Ms. Yin.

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We meet again.

336
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,200
Hello, Mr. Shen.

337
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,759
Nice to meet you.

338
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,679
I look forward to working with you.

339
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,000
Nice to meet you?

340
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,039
Is this really our first time meeting?

341
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,759
Then last night...

342
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,559
Last night? I was reading the script.

343
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,080
Please...

344
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,440
let's not talk about this here, okay?

345
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,519
I'll apologize to you later.

346
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,039
So Mr. Shen and Ms. Yin are old acquaintances?

347
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,119
Ms. Yin here would like to audition.

348
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,480
Why don't we watch it together, Mr. Shen?

349
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,640
Please, have a seat.

350
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,119
Shanshan, good.

351
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,559
Shanshan, good.

352
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,599
Shanshan...

353
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,799
It captures Lu Jin's fragility perfectly!

354
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:24,799
Shanshan...

355
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This is Lu Jin come to life!

356
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What are you doing, Yin Shanshan?

357
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Flowers bloom and fade, flowers fill the sky...

358
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
-Shanshan...
-The red silk snaps, who pities its scent?

359
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,839
Make a note!

360
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,160
This is exactly the shot I want!

361
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,279
Director, is it possible she's actually fainted?

362
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:41,880
Cut!

363
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,319
Just do as I say.

364
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,319
Even if he's not satisfied...

365
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,759
he can't do anything to me.

366
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,400
But when Shen Zhihe goes crazy, he's ruthless.

367
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm worried...

368
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,279
Don't worry.

369
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,000
Only by being cruel enough...

370
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,759
can we make a clean break.

371
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,640
Time is running out.

372
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,880
The main thing is, she can't be implicated anymore.

373
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,000
Aren't you tired of pretending to sleep?

374
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,920
Mr. Shen.

375
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,920
What a coincidence, you saved me again.

376
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,279
You're such a good person.

377
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,359
Um...

378
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,440
If there's nothing else...

379
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,000
I... I should get going now.

380
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,640
You must be busy.

381
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

382
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,000
Hello?

383
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,039
Can I call you back later?

384
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,000
Tonight, Coming for You

385
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,200
is having a live stream to announce the female lead.

386
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,240
But didn't you tell me this morning

387
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,359
they'd give me a chance to audition?

388
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,759
The company has already confirmed Xia Yan for the role.

389
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,759
Do you think if I throw myself at the investor now...

390
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,519
there's still a chance?
