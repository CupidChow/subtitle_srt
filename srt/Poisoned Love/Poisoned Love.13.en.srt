[Episode 13]

4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,080
Shi Yi's manager said it was
just a promotional material.

5
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,600
They are merely Yin Jiang's partner.

6
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,200
She is all over Weibo.

7
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,020
It shouldn't cause us any trouble,

8
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,620
our company isn't affected.

9
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,640
I've been talking all night,

10
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,440
but you keep drinking.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,060
I am not keeping your company for that.

12
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,460
You have other work to do?

13
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,960
Of course.

14
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,840
I am going home to my wife and son.

15
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,730
You've been wooing
Zuo Yao for two months.

16
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,320
There seems to be no progress.

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,720
Patience is a virtue.

18
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,280
I am slowly collecting
an amount of impressions.

19
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,980
Once I've gathered enough of them,

20
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,840
I will impress her
enough to win her heart.

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,440
That won't work.

22
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,200
Why won't it work?

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,480
Mr Shi.

24
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,800
Well,

25
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,350
in terms of relationships,

26
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,720
I am the expert.

27
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,480
Okay.

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,440
So you are the expert.

29
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,840
I have a question for you.

30
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,480
I watched a drama lately.

31
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,579
The female protagonist...

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,360
has a sudden and special
feeling towards the guy.

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,160
But then she left without a word.

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,760
What could be the reason?

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,640
We'll dive into the nuances.

36
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,890
Did the guy...

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,290
somehow do something...

38
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,400
that let her down in a way?

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,840
Not at all.

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,520
Did the guy care about the girl?

41
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,720
Not very well.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,840
What did she say before she left?

43
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,160
She...

44
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,400
packed all her belongings.

45
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,760
Then she told me...

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,620
"Thank you for taking care of me."

47
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,560
So before she left,

48
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,720
did she do something for you?

49
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,880
Before she left,

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,770
she showed me her side of the world.

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,690
She even celebrated my birthday for me.

52
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,680
Then...

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,530
I saw right through you.

54
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,040
Just tell me the answer.

55
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,720
With my professional analysis,

56
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,120
perhaps you took too long to
say the magic words,

57
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,320
she gave up on you,

58
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,200
so she dumped you.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,840
But she is in love with Shi Yi.

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,080
Mr Shi.

61
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,680
Come on.

62
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,520
Is the relationship
between idol and fan...

63
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,280
the same as the love...

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,680
between a couple?

65
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,240
Cheers, I am here for my buddy.

66
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,440
I will help you with your goal.

67
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,520
Come.

68
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,000
Drink slowly, slowly

69
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,040
Fang Yan.

70
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,600
Fang Yan.

71
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,400
You made a wave this time, look at this.

72
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,800
The fan count is rising.

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,670
I didn't know...

74
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,920
this is the spark he talked about.

75
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,200
You got upset,

76
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,810
and Shi Yi showed up
to cheer you up right away.

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
He is the embodiment of perfection,

78
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
I doubt...

79
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,610
you will find another just like him.

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,080
Shi Yi is repaying his fans.

81
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,800
I should thank him for this.

82
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Here.

83
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,560
I wish to take a look at your brain,

84
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,800
is there nothing useful in there?

85
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,340
I am getting famous.

86
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,040
But why am I still upset?

87
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,920
Why must you fall in love...

88
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,280
with that cursed demon Shi Meng?

89
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,000
You are drunk, let's go.

90
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,960
Sit down.

91
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,520
We aren't done...

92
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,880
with your trouble just yet.

93
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,980
There is nothing to talk about.

94
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,280
I am still getting used
to the life without her.

95
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,320
-After all my life...
-Your life is full of movies.

96
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,880
Shi Meng.

97
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,770
If you like her so much,

98
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,560
you should have told her.

99
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,190
You can't just wait for her
to take the initiative.

100
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,000
Shi Meng, ask yourself.

101
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,080
Do you even feel sad after Fang Yan left?

102
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,760
If you don't like her at all,

103
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
why are you...

104
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,890
trying to intoxicate yourself?

105
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,320
You are just too afraid to tell her
how you feel.

106
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,800
You are afraid if you confess...

107
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,960
and if she's in love
with Shi Yi instead,

108
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,080
you would lose face in front of her.

109
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:21,950
[LUMOS]

110
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,800
It's not like your pride
is worth her love!

111
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,600
Go home.

112
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,200
Don't touch me.

113
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,760
If you're in my shoes,

114
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,060
if you don't even know why
you can't win her love,

115
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,360
that will truly be hopeless.

116
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,560
All right.

117
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,520
But I've never thought about giving up.

118
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,240
I was here all night with you.

119
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,080
Do me a favour.

120
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,040
-What is it?
-This should be a lesson for you.

121
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,000
I want you to know...

122
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,760

doesn't falter from love.

Not tomato, but the blueberry!

Yes, Blueberry Bar.

131
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,640
Come here.

132
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,760
Tell him,

133
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,370
I don't care if he dies from
drinking too much.

134
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Hello?

135
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,440
Hello?

136
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,960
He hung up.

137
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,320
Nicely done!

138
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't give her a chance to turn you down.

139

Well played!

140
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,400
Who was that?

141
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,640
None of your concern.

142
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,800
Mother.

143
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,640
Aren't you going to pick him up?

144
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,000
No way.

145
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,560
I am not going to help him.

146
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
I don't care.

147
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,100
After spending the whole day
having fun,

148
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,760
I still can't forget him.

149
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,880
It's so hard to breathe.

150
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,360
Yao Yao, I can't breathe.

151
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,640
Shi Meng, why didn't you stop him?

152
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,480
I tried.

153
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,760
I’ll leave him to you. I have to go now.

Hao Ying Jun, are you trying
to kill yourself with drinking?

Zuo Yao, you are finally here.

158
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,360
I have something to tell you.

159
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,320
I am not a coward.

160
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,320
Forget it.

161

Can you still walk?

I think I have a heart infarction.

163
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,520
You shouldn't drink so much.

164
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,980
It's not like you were
being forced to drink.

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
[Really?]

173
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,440
[It's snowing.]

174
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,040
[It's snowing.]

175
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,860
[I know you would go out
to see the snow.]

176
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,050
[Keep yourself warm, don't catch a cold.]

177
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,280
[We can still be here...]

178
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,600
[for the next first snow.]

179
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,920

[It's snowing.]

181
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,900
[Want to watch the first snow with me?]

182
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,080
No.

183
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,880
No.

184
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,200
[Fang Yan.]

185
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,480
[I like you.]

186
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,200
[Will you be my girlfriend?]

187
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,200
No,

188
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,760
that is too direct.

189
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,420
[Thank you, Fang Yang.]

190
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,720
[You taught me...]

191
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,080
[what destiny is.]

192
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
No.

193
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,840
That is too vague.

194
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,650
[Fang Yan, I want you to know...]

195
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,670
[I want to enjoy your cooking
all the time.]

196
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,840
No!

197
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,050
That would make her my babysitter.

198
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,960
[I had never known love.]

199
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,920
[But then, I met you.]

200
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,160
[Your smiles make
the spring breeze shy away.]

201
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,600
[Only those who's seen it would know.]

202
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,780
[I wasn't there for you in the past,]

203
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,920
[but I want you for the rest of my life.]

204
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,520
[The moon shimmers,]

205
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,310
[I wish I could see it
through your glimmer.]

206
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,280
[The rain comes to every city,]

207
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,810
[just like I would be there
for you anywhere.]

208
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,640
[I will use this song...]

209
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,930
[as a present to you, to reveal my feelings.]

210
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,260
[It needs to be perfect.

211
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,480
-Hello? K?
-Mr Shi Yi.

212
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,360
[Don't forget the filming
ceremony tomorrow.]

213
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,440
I get it.

214
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,780
The ceremony is tomorrow.

215
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,240
[Rest well tonight.]

216
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,390
[I will pick you up early tomorrow.]

217
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Right.

218
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,600
For tomorrow,

219
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,960
I am bringing Fang Yan along.

220
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,400
[Fang Yan?]

221
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,480
[The Tale of Water Utopia,
Filming Ceremony]

222

[Starring Shi Yi, Lin Ling,
A Product of Concept Pictures]

223
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,440
Don't worry, everything is set.

224
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,470
Are all the actors here?
Is anyone absent?

225
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,080
[Our men are keeping a close eye on them.]

226
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,480
[Nothing will go wrong.]

227
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,480
My goodness.

228
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,360
Shi Yi actually came here with Fang Yan.

229
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,680
[Didn't I tell you to
get it done last night?]

230
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,400
[Shi Yi even has his own camera crew.]

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,560
So their interaction ended yesterday,

232
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,960
so he is planning to
make it official today?

233
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,440
Hao Ying Jun.

234
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,880
Keep an eye on them.

235
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,080
Thank you.

236
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,550
How is Fang Yan reacting to all this?

237
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,440
They seem to be having
a good time together.

238
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,840
Boss, where are you now?

239
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,950
I've never been to
a filming ceremony before.

240
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,790
So?

241
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,190
Did the viral news from Weibo
manage to ignite your passion?

242
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,350
Not just igniting,

243
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,560
I am now at the core of it.

244
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,040
Which is why I decided...

245
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,940
to continue being...

246
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,220
the tiny insignificant.

247
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,620
Tiny and insignificant?

248
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,490
Yin Jiang is shining bright.

249
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,720
My Weibo fan count...

250
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,830
would have stayed the same
till the end of time...

251
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,360
had you not boosted it with a click.

252
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,160
Soulmates are hard to come by.

253
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,440
I need but one.

254
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You have the voice and the soulmate.

255
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,320
Be content.

256
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,040
Let's have a look over there.

257
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,160
Okay.

258
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,250
They are having fun!

259
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,440
They are flirting!

260
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,280
-I can handle it.
-They have physical contact!

261
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,599
Mr Shi!

262

Mr Shi!

264
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,960
What do we do now?

265
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,460
What do we do now?

266
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,160
Go, confess your love!

267
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,839
Seize your one true love!

268
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,079
Go!

269
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,850
Why did you bring her here?

270
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,310
For the filming ceremony.

271
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,440
Hold on.

272
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,390
Where are you taking her?

273
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,850
For makeup and hairdo.

274
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,110
But she is a voice actor.

275
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,240
And she still needs makeup and hairdo.

276
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,560
Come with me.

277
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,320
Sit down.

278
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,910
Unless there is an emergency,

279
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,020
stay right here...

280
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,410
no matter what happens.

281
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,550
I’ll explain later.

282
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,240
Carry on with your work.

283
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,120
Okay.

284
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,520
What is wrong now?
Everyone is on edge.

285
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,950
So, what is the meaning of this?

286
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,360
I should be asking you the same thing.

287
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,970
You dragged her away without any reason.

288
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,900
And now you demand an explanation?

289
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,280
Shi Yi,

290
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,820
don't bother pretending.

291
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,180
You added Yin Jiang on Weibo,

292
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,540
it's making a huge wave.

293
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,070
And now you brought her here
to a public event.

294
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,600
If the reporters have a sniff of this,

295
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,130
her life will be affected.
Don't you see that?

296
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,240
See for yourself.

297
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,430
It's just like the ceremony
you put so much effort in,

298
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,290
what if on the day of the ceremony,

299
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,920
the couple from the movie...

300
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,840
were actually...

301
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,600
lovers in real life,

302
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,030
wouldn't you save a ton of money on promotion?

303
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,560
I will never use her as a tool.

304
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,610
What about before this?

305
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,340
Who used her to fool me into
signing the contract?

306
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,190
You should stop being so controlling.

307
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,170
Fang Yan is not your personal accessory.

308
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,690
I bet you think I want to make
our relationship official.

309
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,780
I am not a businessman.

310
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,970
I will never do that.

311
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,570
I won't use this method to
generate fame for myself.

312
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,440
I can't be perfect for Fang Yan,

313
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,330
but at least I am better than you.

314
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,600
I am there for her.

315
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,680
I will never use her.

316
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,520
[Waiting.]

317
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,950
[The endless waiting.]

318
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,610
[We either wait while alive,]

319
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,480
[or pass away during the wait.]

320
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,840
Why did Shi Meng drag me out here?

321
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,520
He looked mad.

322
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,440
Did he start a fight with Shi Yi?

323
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,680
Was it because of me?

324
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,600
"Why did you bring her here?"

325
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,040
"None of your concern."

326
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,220
"She is my roommate,
of course it is my concern."

327
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,560
Fang Yan, what's got into you?
Wake up!

328
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,690
You decided to stay away from his life!

329
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,240
Remember.

330
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
Forget about him.

331
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,940
Shi Yi, what brings you here?

332
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,250
Did Shi Meng bully you?

333
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,680
No. He asked me to stay here.

334
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,200
What's wrong?

335
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,260
Nothing.

336
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,280
Ignore him.

337
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,560
Go wherever you want.

338
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,760
I have to take a few more photos.

339
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,450
Have fun on your own, okay?

340
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,480
It's okay. Carry on with your work.

341
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,920
Wei Lin will be here soon.
Once he is here,

342
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,400
we'll have a look around.

343
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,610
Okay. I will go to you
after my work is done.

344
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,000
We'll take some photos together,

345
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,660
as a souvenir for the Lake God.

346
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,170
Thank you.

347
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,440
Don't mention it.

348
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,360
I don't like being an outsider.

349
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,240
Sure.

350
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Soulmate.

351
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
Go on.

352
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,790
Mr Hao, this is the confirmed list,
have a look.

353
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,480
I'll make the adjustment
if there is any issue.

354
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,720
-Mr Shi.
-Go on.

355
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,550
Why are you here all by yourself?

356
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,550
Where is Fang Yan?

357
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,400
You failed again?

358
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,080
No wonder,

359
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,040
your rival is Shi Yi after all.

360
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,880
I don't care who it is,

361
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,470
I know how I feel about her.

362
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,480
Did I get that right?

363
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,160
You finally get it.

364
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,320
Seriously?

365
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,480
Enough nonsense.

366
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,680
Don't keep that to yourself.

367
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,240
-You have to...
-Wei Lin, where are you now?

368
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
You have to let her know too.

369
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,840
Where are you going?

370
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,820
Where is the resolve and courage
you just showed me?

371
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,030
Put on a smile and muster your courage.

372
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,480
You need to...

373
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,360
You need to go for it!

374
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,920
I am...

375
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,360
Go.

376
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,120
Go!

377
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,200
I am currently...

378
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,750
I don't know how to describe this place.

379
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,800
I'll talk to you later.

380
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,670
Why are you here?
I wasn't wandering around.

381
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,840
It's fine.

382
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,840
You have something to tell me?

383
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,920
I...

384
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,240
Nothing.

385
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,520
I am passing by.

386
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,120
Hold on.

387
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,120
I ran out of pickled cabbage.

388
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,120
The recipe is easy, I can send it to you.

389
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,060
It's not convenient to live with Zuo Yao.

390
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,440
After all,

391
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,930
Zuo You is growing fast
to become a man.

392
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,960
But aren't you a man?

393
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,720
Well...

394
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,140
The cushion for Goo Sen is
still at the balcony.

395
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,560
Bring it to me.

396
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,730
It's too dirty, I am not touching it.

397
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,200
Just wash it.

398
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,760
I don't know how.

399
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,880
What are you trying to say?

400
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,480
I need a babysitter.

401
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,480
Baby...

402
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,200
Babysitter?

403
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,560
It's a marvel.

404
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,480
It was marvellous.

405
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,960
Come on.

406
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,360
You live up to your name,

407
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,510
What you pulled off just now,

408
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,080
that was the best confession...

409
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,280
I've seen in my entire life.

410
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,430
-What else do you want me to say?
-What else?

411
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,230
You might as well tell her
I am in love with Wei Lin,

412
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,830
at least that was better than
your lame excuse.

413
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,440
A babysitter.

414
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,600
He wants me as his babysitter!

415
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,200
What was wrong with you?

416
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,240
Mr Shi?

417
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,580
I just want her to move back in.

418
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,720
Move back there?

419
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,540
Why should I?

420
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,800
To babysit that dude?

421
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,960
Nicely done!

422
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,520
How are you going to clean up this mess?

423
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,040
No matter how I see it,

424
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,360
it wasn't a good way to get her back.

425
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,040
Is he the kind of person...

426
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,560
who has high IQ and almost negative EQ?

427
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,300
Maybe he was in love with you
but he couldn't tell you.

428
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,100
I need a babysitter, come back!

429
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,710
Does that make sense to you?

430
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,760
No.

431
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,480
Figure out something for me.

432
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,500
What would I know?

433
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,000
This mess cannot be fixed.

434
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,240
I am going to confess.

435
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,640
Confession?

436
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,320
Yes.

437
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,020
That is not possible.

438
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,760
-Why not?
-Impossible.

439
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,900
You had been living with each other
for so long.

440
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,700
It may not be love at first sight,

441
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,800
but it could be love over time.

442
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,660
Shi Meng never had any other woman
in his life...

443
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,240
so closely for so long.

444
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,680
[All staff be ready.]

445
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,620
[The ceremony is starting soon.]

446
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,080
[All staff be ready.]

447
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,440
[The ceremony is starting soon.]

448
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,770
We should go over there.

449
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,400
Just take it easy, come on.

450
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,600
All right, let's go.

451
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,570
Let's welcome our main production crew.

452
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,890
The director and Shi Yi...

453
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,240
please unveil the camera.

454
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,920
The ceremony commence!

455
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,400
-Great!
-One, two, three!

456
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,020
We appreciate all the reporters...

457
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,180
for attending the filming ceremony
of The Tale of Water Utopia.

458
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,440
Up next, we will have the photo sessions.

459
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,520
Come.

460
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,030
Fang Yan, why are
you standing back there?

461
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,120
Come forward.

462
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,520
All for The Tale of Water Utopia!

463
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,520
This is my first time doing this.

464
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,540
I have no experience.

465
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,610
Think of something for me.

466
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,200
But you can't just ask someone else
to do it for you.

467
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,040
Is it really okay for us...

468
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,370
to be doing this here?

469
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,000
So,

470
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,790
why must we turn off the lights?

471
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
It's exhilarating!

472
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,720
Turn the lights on.

473
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,960
"Secret To Winning Hearts".

474
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,840
My grandfather left it for me.

475
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,920
It's from the year 1919.

476
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,840
Good stuff.

477
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,800
Wei Lin.

478
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,760
You can't rob the grave of your family...

479
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,860
to cope with your existential crisis.

480
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,490
I bet that book is used to kill zombies.

481
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,090
Even if the tricks do work,
it's way too creepy.

482
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,520
"There was..."

483
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,840
Stop reading it.

484
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,720
It's a little out of date.

485
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
Dear Shi Meng.

486
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,460
We must not let some random simpleton...

487
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,930
lower our class to theirs.

488
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,960
You have me with you.

489
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,700
Based on my experience,

490
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,520
a successful confession...

491
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,910
will only take place
when you show her...

492
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,480
the best and most unique side of you.

493
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,160
What is most unique about me?

494
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,600
You are cold.

495
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,000
Cold?

496
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,040
Cold.

497
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,920
Put your coldness...

498
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,040
on display.

499
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,560
How about this? Starting today,

500
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,560
block her.

501
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,920
Ghost her.

502
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,360
Stop contacting her.

503
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,680
Keep it going.

504
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,440
This is the fun part.

505
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,960
Ghost her for a few months.

506
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,160
Then...

507
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,300
show her the worst cold shoulder.

508
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,840
Make her take the initiative.

509
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Hold on.

510
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,240
That takes too long.

511
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,960
With Fang Yan's brain,

512
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,400
she will have forgotten about Mr Shi.

513
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,160
-But I think...
-He has a point.

514
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,110
Then stop giving me lousy advice.

515
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,920
Mr Shi, leave it to me.

516
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,240
I know Fang Yan the best.

517
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,600
Her biggest flaw is being soft-hearted.

518
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,040
You can't go headstrong with her.

519
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,960
You need to...

520
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,520
get her sympathy.

521
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,120
How do I do that?

522
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,400
Tell her...

523
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,870
you filed for bankruptcy and
debt collectors are after you.

524
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,000
Then you are on the run.

525
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,920
You keep running.

526
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,050
And running all the way.

527
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,280
Then...

528
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,080
ghost her for a week or so.

529
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,480
Go to her in your dirty
and ragged clothes.

530
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,600
Just like I am now.

531
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,600
Wei Lin.

532
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,600
I think...

533
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,360
sympathy is all she has for him.

534
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,080
If I were Fang Yan,

535
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,600
sparing Mr Shi some coins...

536
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,800
would be the greatest sympathy from me.

537
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,720
And I noticed...

538
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,720
your IQ...

539
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,580
deserves some sympathy as well.

540
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,520
Mr Shi, ignore him.
We'll figure something out.

541
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,390
Yes.

542
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,280
If none of these work on her,

543
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,680
we have a more direct approach.

544
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,760
Make her comply.

545
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,200
What is it?

546
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,840
First of all,

547
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,040
use your charismatic voice...

548
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,400
to charm her.

549
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,560
"Hi, baby."

550
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,640
Then,

551
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,440
use your strong body figure...

552
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,960
to attract her attention.

553
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,920
Finally,

554
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,720
use your wealth...

555
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,600
to conquer her.

556
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,600
-Tell me you love me.
-I love you!

557
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,090
If this doesn't work,

558
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,520
it doesn't matter.

559
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,840
"Yan Yan!"

560
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,250
"Mr Shi, you must answer for this!"

561
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,210
-"You must answer for this!"
-Forget it, I'll do it myself.

562
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,670
Was that too far-fetched?

563
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,800
Babysitter?

564
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,800
He thinks I am the babysitter!

565
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,560
This is outrageous!

566
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,880
Babysitter.

567
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,780
Outrageous.

568
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,840
Fang Yan!

569
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,160
I lost Goo Se.

570
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,920
How did you lose it?

571
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,410
I wanted to take it out
for a walk after dinner.

572
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,390
It ran off for a pretty bird!

573
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,730
It ran off for a pretty bird?

574
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,930
I bet you saw a pretty girl
and forgot it!

575
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,180
Search over there, I'll search this side.

576
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,170
Let's split up.

577
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,680
Fine, but I warn you.

578
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,160
You either find it,

579
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,920
-or get lost!
-Fine.

580
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,060
Search over there.

581
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,560
Why are you here?

582
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,760
Wei Lin called me to help him
search for the bird.

583
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,160
Let's team up.

584
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,080
Hello?

585
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,800
Fine.

586
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,280
I am heading back now.

587
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,120
Wei Lin found Goo Se.

588
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,320
I am glad to hear that.

589
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,410
I am going home.

590
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,280
-I can send you home.
-Never mind.

591
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,340
It's not safe for you to go home alone.

592
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,000
Come on.

593
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,360
Fang Yan.

594
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,760
Look.
