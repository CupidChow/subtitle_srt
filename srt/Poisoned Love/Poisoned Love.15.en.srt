we're going to eat dumplings.

175
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,300
We're not eating gold.

176
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,640
-But...
-Aren't you going to live with me?

177
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,900
You can't waste money.

178
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,120
Thank you.

179
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,920
-Miss, buy some meat.
-Beef.

180
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,120
Let's take a look.

181
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,640
Beef...

182
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,760
Boss, I want
two "cow's precious"(testicles).

183
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,560
Alright.

184
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh right.

185
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,880
What do you want to eat tonight?

186
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,120
I'll let you decide.

187
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,080
Cow's precious?

188
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,940
A precious beef?

189
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,960
Boss, we want one too.

190
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,720
-Alright.
-Tonight, we'll eat...

191
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,000
dumplings with cow's precious tonight.

192
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,240
Here you go.

193
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,280
-RMB100.
-RMB100? Thanks.

194
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,080
It looks weird. Pay him.

195
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,760
Done.

196
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,940
Thank you, boss. Goodbye.

197
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,760
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

198
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,640
Let's go buy some vegetables.

199
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,480
You'll make the noodles
and I'll prepare the vegetables.

200
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,640
Let's have a normal life.

201
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,440
Why do I feel a little hungry?

202
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,119
Why are you looking at me?

203
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,920
Are you fascinated by my beauty?

204
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,839
Are you joking?

205
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,599
It's you who is fascinated by me.

206
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,020
Why didn't I know about it?

207
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,560
Still pretending?

208
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,200
Tell me, when did you start to like me?

209
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,200
This...

210
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,810
will not be fun if I tell you.

211
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,080
You guess it.

212
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,400
Fine.

213
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,840
When I first lived in your house?

214
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,040
No.

215
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,480
I know.

216
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,720
It was the time when it rained
and you came to the record store.

217
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,000
I gave you an umbrella.

218
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,520
I knew it.

219
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,160
You started to covet my beauty
since that day.

220
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,320
Yes.

221
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,320
Pretty.

222
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,760
A special kind of pretty.

223
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,120
How special?

224
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,320
That kind...

225
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,680
of pretty...

226
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,200
that is hardly noticeable.

227
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,840
Fool.

228
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,800
What did you say just now?

229
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,280
Fool.

230
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,920
Fool?

231
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,720
[So when did you start to like me?]

232
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,440
[I don't know.]

233
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,800
[I seemed to like you unconsciously.]

234
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,240
[Could it be...]

235
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,320
[love at first sight?]

236
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,040
[I don't know
if it's love at first sight.]

237
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,520
[But knowing you...]

238
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,840
[must be fated.]

239
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,640
Mother, what are we eating today?

240
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,760
Today is Winter Solstice Festival,
of course we need to eat dumplings.

241
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,800
But I'm going to make
a very high-class stuffing.

242
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,410
Cow's testicle dumplings.

243
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,520
My favourite.

244
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,480
Mother.

245
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,920
Shouldn't you make stuffing first
before rolling the dumpling skin?

246
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,720
Really?

247
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,800
Of course.

248
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,280
I'm going to chop the stuffing.

249
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,120
Yeah, I've raised the knife.

250
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,160
If it weren't for your uncle
who has gone for film shooting,

251
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,320
I won't be in a mess now.

252
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,040
Chop the stuffing.

253
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,960
Like this?

254
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,600
Can we still eat dumplings?

255
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,140
I think it's better
to eat frozen dumplings.

256
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,480
You're too free.

257
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,520
I'll give you a Coke...

258
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,960
to pass time, alright?

259
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Listen.

260
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,960
You must have confidence in me.

261
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Give me some time.

262
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,400
Be patient, alright?

263
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,280
This small matter won't beat me.

264
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,760
It's just chopping the stuffing.

265
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,620
It's so easy.
Go and open the door.

266
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Alright.

267
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,480
I'll chop it first.

268
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,560
Hi.

269
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,880
Let's go.

270
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm sorry for being late today.

271
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,200
Don't worry.

272
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,120
I brought a lot of delicious food for you.

273
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,960
You just wait and see.

274
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,720
Hi.

275
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,640
Who asked you to come?

276
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,920
I heard that you want to eat dumplings.

277
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,440
So, I came here.

278
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,480
You know me.

279
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,480
I'm nothing...

280
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,720
but kind.

281
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,400
In my heart,

282
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,200
Zuo Yao is always there.

283
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,960
Really?

284
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Yes.

285
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I just want to eat dumplings.

286
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,080
Yeah.

287
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,320
He wants to eat dumplings.

288
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
Today is Winter Solstice Festival.

289
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,960
The delicious dumplings are here.

290
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,780
It smells good.

291
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,540
This is the result of our hard work.

292
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,440
We should take a picture
to commemorate it, right?

293
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,920
Give me the phone.

294
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,720
What's wrong?

295
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,200
This...

296
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
What's wrong?

297
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Doesn't it look good?

298
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,190
Yes.

299
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,740
Why are you laughing then?

300
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,640
It's very nice.

301
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,960
But why did you change
my phone's screen saver?

302
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,040
Because I want you
to see me all the time.

303
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,500
But I'm looking at you all the time.

304
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,680
I still wanted to change it.

305
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,800
Alright.

306
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,780
What about your phone?

307
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,280
What's your screen saver?

308
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,480
Let me see.

309
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,480
Let me see.

310
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,320
I'll use this as my screen saver.

311
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,080
Let's eat before it gets cold.

312
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,400
There's still something to do tonight.

313
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,520
We've agreed
that I'll decide for the night.

314
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,440
Mother.

315
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,920
Don't be angry.

316
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,200
He came just to work.

317
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,000
You need to pay if you hire a nanny.

318
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,920
Ask him to go after he's done.

319
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,080
Brat.

320
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,000
Who taught you this?

321
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,160
How do I teach you?

322
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,880
Don't take the efforts of others
for granted.

323
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,200
You must thank Uncle Hao Ying Jun later.

324
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,320
If not for him,

325
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,360
not only today,

326
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,080
you won't have dumplings
for tomorrow as well.

327
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,960
Where are we going?

328
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,240
I'll decide for the night.

329
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,300
You'll know when we get there.

330
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,320
Thank you.

331
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,960
Can't you be more practical?

332
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,400
Let's go.

333
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,000
Here you go.

334
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,650
Since it's done,

335
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,200
I'll leave first.

336
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,990
Since Uncle Hao Ying Jun
wants to leave,

337
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,200
I won't send you off.

338
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,300
You guys eat warm dumplings.

339
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,080
I'll go home and eat frozen dumplings.

340
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,640
Forget it, let's eat together.

341
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,000
I won't reject your offer then.

342
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,120
I won't be shy.

343
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,120
Let's eat.

344
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,960
Zuo You, go get a pair of chopsticks.

345
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,000
Alright.

346
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,680
Don't need to trouble you.

347
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,520
I brought my own.

348
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,210
Zuo You, go take a spoon.

349
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Don't go to any trouble.

350
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,920
I brought my own.

351
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,470
Zuo You, go get a bowl.

352
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,920
No need.

353
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,680
Let's eat.

354
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,610
Let me give my dearest son...

355
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,320
a dumpling first.

356
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,200
Then, I'll give my dearest Yao Yao...

357
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,040
a dumpling too.

358
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Your favourite,

359
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,120
cow's testicle stuffing.

360
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,560
My favourite, cow's testicle stuffing.

361
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,290
Our whole family
loves cow's testicle stuffing.

362
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,360
Save it, you look like a cow's testicle.

363
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,000
Hurry up and eat.
Shut your mouth.

364
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,240
Let's eat dumplings.

365
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,480
By the way,

366
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,480
if you want to eat dumplings again,
just let me know.

367
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,680
I'll come right away.

368
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,600
Thanks for today,
but there won't be next time.

369
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,520
Yao Yao.

370
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,040
Can you tell me who's Zuo You's father?

371
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,580
What's his name? Where is he?
What does he do?

372
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,360
Give me a valid reason, can you?

373
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,720
If he treats you better than me,

374
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,720
I'll leave right away.

375
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,400
Stop wasting your energy,
just give up.

376
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,600
Hao Ying Jun, you must not give up

377
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,310
In this world,

378
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,440
no one treats Zuo Yao better than you.

379
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,240
Because your surname is Hao.

380
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,000
Be careful.

381
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,840
It's late now, why did you bring me here?

382
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,840
Just follow me.

383
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Why do I feel like
getting on a thief's ship?

384
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,440
Come.

385
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,480
Come.

386
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,840
Are you ready?

387
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,920
Did I really get on a thief's ship?

388
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,410
What are you thinking about?
Close your eyes.

389
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,400
No peeking.

390
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,260
You can open your eyes now.

391
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,490
From now on,
I'll accompany you to watch the stars...

392
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,400
and you accompany me
to watch the galaxy.

393
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,200
Alright?

394
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,440
Thank you, Shi Meng.

395
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,640
You let me see...

396
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,960
such a beautiful galaxy.

397
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,830
As long as it's your wish,

398
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,720
I'll help you realize it.

399
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,470
Let's watch the meteors together
next time, alright?

400
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,170
Why must it be the next time?

401
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,520
Make a wish now.

402
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,160
Done?

403
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,480
What did you wish for?

404
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,000
Nothing.

405
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,800
Why not?

406
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,120
That's because...

407
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,160
Everything I want

408
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,600
I already have.
