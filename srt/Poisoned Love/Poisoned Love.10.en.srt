3
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,979
The soup you made tastes good too.

4
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,810
Drink more if it's good.

5
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,080
Sure.

6
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,320
It's good. I'll drink it.

7
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,320
Have you ever been in love?

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
What?

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,560
What's your problem?

10
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,840
Sorry.

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,240
I just want to say,

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
stay away from Shi Yi.

14
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,040
Why?

15
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,600
He dated a lot of women,

16
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,840
don't you know?

17
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,240
So, he has this kind of scandal?

18
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
I've never heard of this.

19
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,880
What do you know
about the entertainment industry?

20
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
How do you know?

21
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,120
I really regret it.

22
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,930
I should've learnt...

23
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,590
some dating experience from Shi Yi.

24
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,000
I really regret it.

25
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,560
The director said...

26
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,700
that my Lake God isn't flirty enough.

27
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
I have to learn from Shi Yi.

28
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,960
He is not the script writer.

29
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,160
How does he know what is in a girl's mind?

30
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,640
Mr Shi,

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,920
is your face...

32
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,320
from McDonald's?

33
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,400
McDonald's?

34
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Where?

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,400
Look.

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm...

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,200
loving...

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
it!

39
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,579
How's that? Were you attracted by me?

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,090
Do you want another jacket?

41
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,760
Don't you feel cold?

42
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,079
No, I don't.

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
Let's drink it, drink it.

44
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,720
Drink up.

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,880
It's full of your saliva,
how can I drink it?

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,740
I'll get another bowl.

47
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,800
I've drunk pork trotter soup
for an entire day,

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,080
I'm turning into a pork trotter soon.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,960
Mr Shi,

50
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,480
I... I know you hate seeing me
being so messy,

51
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,680
that's why I really need to wash my hair.

52
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,240
It's really itchy.

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,360
Hurry up.

54
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,440
Thank you, Mr Shi!

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,320
This is so annoying.

56
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,500
What are you doing?

57
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,440
Mr Shi,

58
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,720
I think my hand has fully recovered.

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
I plead to remove the bandage.

60
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,840
No.

61
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,720
How do I wash my hair
if I don't remove it?

62
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,980
That's not my problem.

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,250
Settle it yourself.

64
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,880
I will remove it.

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,480
You'll be fined if you remove it.

66
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,480
What is wrong with you?

67
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Since when did you implement this rule?

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
How can you be so mean?

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
I'll write it off if you don't remove it.

70
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,400
Are you trying to say...

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,200
if I keep wearing them,

72
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,240
I get to earn more money, right?

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,760
You smart little brain.

74
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,000
You're so smart.

75
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,720
You're a little money maker.

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,159
Let's get in.

77
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,400
Let me help you.

78
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,920
Don't move.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,920
It hurts.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Lower.

81
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,040
Can you be more gentle?

82
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,720
This is also my first time.

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,160
Hang on for a while.

84
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,720
Can I switch another pose?

85
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,240
Just hang on for a second.

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,040
I'll be done soon.

87
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,000
What is wrong again?

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,360
It's so hot.

89
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,159
It's fine now.

90
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,520
Thank you.

91
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,280
As for the rehearsal,

92
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,000
I will help you out.

93
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,280
You?

94
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,780
What's the matter?

95
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Is Shi Yi the only one who can help you?

96
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,800
Shi Yi is the main actor.
Besides, he's an actor.

97
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,000
You're not an actor,

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,130
-you're a producer.
-Are you questioning my expertise?

99
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,360
The role of Lake God...

100
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,120
not only has the innocence of a girl,

101
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,640
but also the charm of a goddess.

102
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,960
After her seal was broken,

103
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,620
you need to put more effort
in delivering those flirty dialogues.

104
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,240
Do you still remember the dialogue
between Prince of Wolf and Lake God?

105
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,120
Of course.

106
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,000
That dialogue
actually puts the central idea to test.

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,559
The dialogue seems to be a question,

108
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,960
but it is actually forcing them
to admit their inner thoughts.

109
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,800
For someone like you
who can only flirt using McDonald's...

110
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
you ought to stop being so cliche.

111
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,040
You...

112
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,960
Now that I am here,

113
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,840
don't you have anything to tell me?

114
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
Don't you have any question for me?

115
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,760
Or do you want me to ask you...

116
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,720
if you...

117
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,360
actually...

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,800
actually...

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
actually...

120
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,360
Do you actually like me?

121
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,840
Yes.

122
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,720
Yes.

123
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,480
That's the line!

124
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,600
That's right.

125
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,040
Great job, great job.

126
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,280
That's not bad.

127
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,120
Try it again.

128
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,480
Cheers!

By the way,

131
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,040
two days ago, you were dejected...

132
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,570
because of the character.
How did you come to this epiphany?

133
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,560
Maybe it was because
Shi Meng rehearsed with me.

134
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,480
Rehearsed?

135
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,260
He rehearsed the confession scene
with you?

136
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,480
Was there any romantic spark
between both of you?

137
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,570
Not again. You mention it all the time.
How annoying.

138
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,080
You guys go ahead.
I'll answer a call first.

139
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,480
Hello.

140
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,380
Just ignore my sister.

141
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,640
I will not believe it.

As a love master with years of experience,

Look into my eyes,

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
tell me,

146
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,000
when you were rehearsing with him,

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,120
did you blush?

148
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,400
Blush?

[actually...]

152
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,280
Look at you. Just the thought of it
is making you blush.

153
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,680
Then, besides blushing,

154
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
did you feel your heart beating fast?

155
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,160
But...

156
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,840
isn't that...

157
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,880
because of the scene?

158
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,280
Wait.

159
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't tell me that
when you were rehearsing with me,

160
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,960
you were thinking about him.

161
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,770
That's because I wanted...

162
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,520
to find the feeling when we rehearsed.

163
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,960
Then, besides rehearsal,

164
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,160
think about it carefully.

165
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,080
Have you actually fallen for him?

166
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,320
How is that possible?
Why would I fall for Shi Meng?

167
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,400
How do I know
what does falling in love feel like?

168
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,060
You've watched
so many idol dramas for nothing.

169
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,080
Of course they were for nothing.
Don't you know...

170
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,880

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,840
Zuo Yao told me that you had a flare-up.

340
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,760
No, I didn't.

341
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,840
Didn't the horror movie scare you?

342
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,800
After I got in,

343
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,480
I realised things didn't seem right.

344
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,240
So, I closed my eyes immediately.

345
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,480
That was really close. I was terrified.

346
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,400
That's great.

347
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,880
Your mask.

348
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,800
Then...

349
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,760
Let's go. Let me send you home.

350
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,200
-Sure.
-Let's go.

351
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,420
What's the matter?

352
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,410
Still feeling dejected
because of the movie?

353
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,960
No.

354
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,480
I was just thinking about something.

355
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,240
If the person you like doesn't like you,

356
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,920
what will you do?

357
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,200
Just give up then.

358
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,080
Instead of chasing after someone
who doesn't love you,

359
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,140
why not choose someone who loves you?

360
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,490
You'll be happier that way.

361
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,760
It's getting late.

362
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,240
Go inside.

363
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,000
Thanks for today.

364
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,280
See you.

365
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
Fang Yan!

366
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,040
If you want to watch movie again,

367
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,250
we could watch it together.

368
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,120
You're home.

369
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,880
Is this for me?

370
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,760
I ordered too much.

371
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,160
You seem to have a busy day at work.

372
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,800
About the cinema,

373
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,960
I'd forgotten.

374
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,320
Don't worry about it.

375
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,040
Let me tell you,
the movie was really good.

376
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,440
The wife really loves her husband.

377
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Do you think he deserves to be loved?

378
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
Then...

379
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,380
what kind of people deserved to be loved?

380
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,320
I'm just curious...

381
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,560
about your view on love.

382
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,960
It's simple.

383
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,840
My life is only about movies.

384
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,880
To me, relationship...

385
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,930
will be wasting my time and effort.

386
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,920
Well...

387
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,120
I want to tell you
that our agreed time is approaching.

388
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,560
I want to discuss with you.

389
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,680
Could I...

390
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,020
I'll find a house for you.
Get the address from Hao Ying Jun.

391
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,360
[This is not what I wanted to say.]

392
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,680
[What agreed time is approaching?]

393
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,040
[I actually wanted to stay.]

394
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,760
[But now, I can only move out from here.]

395
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,280
How was it? Did you have fun?

396
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,640
-I did.
-Okay. In that case, let's watch a movie.

397
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,440
Sure.

398
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,060
What are we going to watch?

399
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,120
You choose.

400
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,080
Sure.

401
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,040
Xiao Yan Yan!

402
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,280
What's wrong? Why do you want to jog
in the middle of the night?

403
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,480
I just want to...

404
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,440
exercise. Stress relief.

405
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,160
What kind of stress do you have?

406
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,960
What's the matter?

407
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,520
You look under the weather.

408
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,240
Nothing.

409
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,440
Cut it out.
Stop putting on an act in front of me.

410
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,240
Hurry up. Tell me what happened.

411
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,600
Well...

412
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,040
I was thinking...

413
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
-If I ever date someone...
-You?

414
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,150
Who do you date?

415
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,600
I said if! If, if.

416
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,520
You scared me.

417
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,880
Actually, dating...

418
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,420
has nothing to do with you.

419
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,640
Let's be realistic.

420
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,400
Stop watching pointless idol drama
all the time, will you?

421
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,800
I've been too realistic,

422
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,680
that is why I haven't never dated.

423
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,160
Who do you want to date?

424
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,380
Will any man accept
this kind of treatment method,

425
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,540
letting you kiss and hug another man?

426
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
And the main point is...

427
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,960
that other man is the superstar, Shi Yi.

428
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,520
-But...
-But?

429
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
No "but".

430
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,240
Believe me.

431
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,720
No man will be able
to bear this kind of unfair treatment,

432
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,400
watching her girlfriend cheat on him.

433
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,800
Is he a maniac?

434
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,360
This might sound hurtful,

435
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
but curing illness is your top priority!

436
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,280
Yan Yan!

437
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,600
Wait up!

438
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,400
I'm not done yet!

439
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,930
[I need to cure my illness,]

440
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,520
[this is reality.]

441
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,010
[I need to rely on Shi Yi to cure me,]

442
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,240
[this is also a reality.]

443
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,360
[But I like Shi Meng,]

444
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,450
[and he doesn't like me,
this is an undeniable reality.]

445
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,960
[Fang Yan,]

446
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,680
[you ought to wake up.]
