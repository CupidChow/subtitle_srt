[Poisoned Love]

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,710
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,440
I accidentally washed
the clothes yesterday.

5
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,820
I want to ask...

6
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,550
if you can...

7
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,210
lend me some...

8
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,800
personal items.

9
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,990
I won't...

10
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,720
bother you again.

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,760
I see.

12
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,980
Follow me upstairs.

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,560
Thank you.

14
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,520
Take a look.

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,860
You can take anything.

16
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,480
Thank you.

17
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,770
How are you?

18
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,880
I'm doing fine recently.

19
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,110
I shouldn't look.

20
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,750
How about this?

21
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,040
Is there a cheaper one?

22
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,230
This is cheap.

23
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,380
Forget it.

24
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,720
I don't need this.
This is too expensive.

25
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,240
If so...

26
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,760
There's nothing that suits you?

27
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
None.

28
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,740
Follow me.

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,440
The troubles of the rich...

30
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,560
are really simple.

31
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,420
These are the things I usually like.

32
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,380
It's all here.

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,800
Take a look.

34
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,960
Is this a stereo?

35
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,710
Why is there a...

36
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,790
I'm sorry, I'll put it back.

37
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,120
Anything that you like?

38
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,620
I used to...

39
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,040
like woodcraft.

40
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,010
This is my first musical instrument
made of wood.

41
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,940
It has been with me all these years.

42
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,140
Take this.

43
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,100
I can't take it.

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,800
It's too sentimental.

45
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,680
If it can heal you,

46
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,420
it's the greatest meaning
of its existence.

47
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,440
Take it.

48
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,150
Thank you.

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,680
I don't know what to say.

50
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,840
How about this?

51
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Treat this as my second wish.

52
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,950
Alright?

53
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,180
That's great.

54
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,920
I don't need to trouble you
to treat me anymore.

55
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,620
It's full of energy.

56
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,040
Dear harmonica.

57
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,840
Please help me in the future.

58
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,200
Don't worry, I'm the warmest
little harmonica in the world.

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,920
I'll treat your illness.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,390
My goodness, harmonica.

61
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,940
You're so great.

62
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,910
Do you know that?

63
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,870
I'll treat your illness from now on.

64
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,930
You can prepare for the audition
of Lake God at ease now.

65
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,560
I know.

66
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,000
But the audition of Lake God...

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,230
What's wrong, Xiao Yan Yan?

68
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,290
How are your preparations
for the audition of Lake God?

69
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,800
I've prepared for it
the whole afternoon.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
However,

71
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,620
I kept feeling something's wrong.

72
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,090
Talk to the director then.

73
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,670
I've sent message to the director,

74
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,390
but he didn't reply me.

75
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,790
Did I not perform well?

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,580
-So...
-If you're so free,

77
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,530
why don't you two practice together?

78
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,050
Hurry, I'll be the spectator.

79
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
Come on.

80
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,240
Ready.

81
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,320
Go.

82
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
Who am I?

83
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,320
Where do I come from?

84
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Don't you know where you come from?

85
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,540
Do you have parents?

86
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,640
Must I...

87
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,100
have parents?

88
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,140
Of course.

89
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,080
Humans are born by his mother.

90
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,640
Demons are born by his mother.

91
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,200
You can forget who your father is,

92
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,000
but you must have a mother.

93
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,170
Who's my mother then?

94
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,680
Where do I come from?

95
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,600
Am I a human...

96
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,140
or a demon?

97
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,640
I think...

98
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,200
you look like...

99
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,520
a goose.

100
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,840
They say...

101
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,830
I'm a goose.

102
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,090
From the outside,

103
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,770
hands on my back,

104
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,090
head up,

105
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,290
chest out,

106
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,550
when I walk,

107
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,110
I wobble.

108
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
If I'm a goose,

109
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,770
why don't I know it?

110
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,990
Why do I...

111
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,930
know nothing of my past?

112
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,540
-That's awesome!
-Really?

113
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,760
Was that when the Lake God's memory...

114
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,800
was sealed?

115
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,030
-Yes.
-I understand it.

116
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,360
I can hear the simplicity and confusion
in your voice.

117
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,320
Really?

118
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,500
But I kept feeling...

119
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,680
something's weird.

120
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,890
-No.
-This is my first dubbing of a movie.

121
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't have any experience.

122
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,640
-It's alright.
-Don't worry.

123
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,680
You just lack confidence.

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,560
Yeah.

125
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,159
You're awesome.

126
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,070
The director sent a message to me.

127
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,990
The director?

128
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,200
I don't dare to listen.

129
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,640
-Play it.
-Hurry.

130

[I think your voice is really good.]

131
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,960
[It's full of emotions too.]

132
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,670
[The only flaw was...]

133
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,700
[it lacks naivety and innocence...]

134
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,680
[of a goose.]

00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,820
[You can try...]

138
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,330
[Alright?]

139
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,850
-This is it.
-Do you hear it?

140
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,610
-Yes.
-Do you hear it?

141
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,520
The director praised me.

142
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,020
But...

143
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,900
What theory did he say?

144
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,720
Isn't this a fantasy movie?

145
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,730
-What should I do?
-Leave it to me.

146
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,270
Brother.

147
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,450
So, you don't like Shi Yi's scent?

148
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,890
I'll throw it then.

149
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Let me go!

150
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
Let go!

151
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,340
Let go!

152
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,880
Let go?

153
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,040
Let go!

154
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,670
Little cutie.

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,920
You're so cute.

156
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,840
I'll hug you if you're obedient.

157
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,860
Fang Yan!

158
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,820
Come out!

159
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,530
Mr Shi, you're back.

160
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,520
May I know...

161
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
what do you want to eat today?

162
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,430
We have...

163
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,640
the eight cuisine,

164
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,430
Thai food, French food,
Italian food and...

165
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,020
red wine, coffee, Tieguanyin,

166
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,020
Coke, Sprite...

167
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,340
and milk.

168
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,210
It rhymes.

169
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,210
Yes.

170
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,650
Did you make trouble?

171
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,720
No.

172
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,380
I'm serious.

173
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,780
If there's nothing else,

174
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,250
I'll go in first. Good night.

175
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,090
Hold on.

176
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,210
You must have brought someone back.

177
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Pay the fine.

178
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,800
No, I didn't bring anyone back.

179
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,760
What are you doing?

180
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,900
What are you hiding then?

181
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,440
Open the door.

182
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,040
-No.
-Open the door!

183
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,080
No.

184
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,640
-Open the door!
-No!

185
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,040
No!

186
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,960
Your head...

187
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,260
Explain.

188
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,460
Mr Shi.

189
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,530
This is Goo Se.

190
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,200
What?

191
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Goo Se.

192
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,410
That's a goose.

193
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,680
Just like its name.

194
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,800
I didn't ask you to explain...

195
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,460
whether it is a bird or a goose.

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
I ask you to explain...

197
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,970
why did it...

198
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,250
appear in...

199
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,400
my...

200
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,800
house?

201
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,350
It's like this.

202
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,960
Wei Lin...

203
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,820
wanted to help me
experience the role of Lake God.

204
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
Then,

205
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,090
he suddenly sent it by courier.

206
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,640
I accepted it.

207
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,760
That's all.

208
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,870
Experience the role?

209
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,900
Act in front of a goose?

210
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,120
Because after the Lake God's memory
was sealed,

211
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,420
he's in the form
of a domestic goose.

212
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,160
Do you have to act in front of a pig
if you take the role of Marshal Tian Peng?

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,720
I think yes.

214
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,620
Send it away.

215
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,800
Mr Shi.

216
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,570
Look at it.

217
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,060
It's so cute...

218
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,980
and helpless.

219
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,760
Helpless?

220
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,240
Mr Shi.

221
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,700
It's quiet.

222
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,420
It's quiet and white.

223
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,080
It looks naive and innocent.

224
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,350
Give it a chance.

225
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,770
Besides, it's here to help me
experience the role.

226
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,090
It can help me find the character.

227
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,460
If it finds the character,
I'll find it too.

228
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,360
If I find the character,
the outcome will be better.

229
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,240
It will be.

230
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,580
I'll tell you one last time.

231
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,240
Send it...

232
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,560
away immediately.

233
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,540
Please give it another chance.

234
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,440
Deep breath.

235
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,960
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,210
Calm down.

237
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,180
Mr Shi.

238
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,800
Goo Se.

239
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,560
Mr Shi, Goo Se and I...

240
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,840
Mr Shi!

241
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,760
Mr..

242
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,830
Mr Shi!

243
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,300
The two of us are alone now.

244
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,970
Don't worry.

245
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,380
Even if we end up on the street,

246
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,640
I won't abandon you.

247
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,920
We'll live together.

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,800
If you die,

249
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,410
I can live.

250
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,130
That scares me.

251
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,760
Are we going to spend the night here?

252
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,800
Goo Se.

253
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,160
This can't be.

254
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,240
[Shi Meng]

255
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,880
[Fang Yan]

256
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,400
My goodness.

257
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,850
[Sister Fang Yan.]

258
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,660
[Who do you think lives
in this beautiful house?]

259
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,300
[Dear Goo Se.]

260
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,180
I guess someone who lives
in such a beautiful house...

261
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,340
must be a...

262
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,470
guy who's...

263
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,470
[generous,]

264
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,790
[kind, handsome...]

265
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,280
[and chic.]

266
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,670
Sister Fang Yan.

267
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,190
If he sees the two of us...

268
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,870
alone and helpless here,

269
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,800
[do you think he'll take us in?]

270
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,920
I think...

271
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,230
you're right.

272
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,530
Listen.

273
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,480
The north wind blows.

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,800
[If...]

275
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,430
[he heard...]

276
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,910
his Lake God is shivering at the door,

277
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,760
can he...

278
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,400
still be at ease...

279
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,800
and won't open...

280
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,000
the door?

281
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,330
[Why is the corridor
suddenly becomes dark?]

282
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,490
It scared me.

283
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,260
Won't he open the door?

284
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,280
I'm not finished.

285
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,300
[Is she scared again?]

286
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,520
Don't go, I'm afraid.

287
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,290
Where's the light?

288
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,490
Goo Se.

289
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,590
Actually,

290
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,940
we really...

291
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,530
can't blame Shi Meng.

292
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,800
He didn't know that...

293
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,280
we suddenly appeared.

294
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,160
Is that right?

295
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,220
So...

296
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,099
Are you hungry?

297
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,160
Only this one time.

298
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,480
Tomorrow,

299
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,460
you'll leave if the goose's here.

300
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,310
We...

301
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,160
Mr Shi.

302
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,320
Thank you for taking us in today.

303
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,890
Please accept this apple goose.

304
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
Thank you for forgiving us...

305
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,440
for trespassing.

306
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,370
I'm just temporarily letting you
stay for a night.

307
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,520
We'll talk about the rest later.

308
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
I don't need this.

309
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,640
Wait!

310
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,270
I can prove our sincerity...

311
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,310
with a gift.

312
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
Tell me.

313
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,050
Can you hold it?

314
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,040
Thank you.

315
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,610
Before this,

316
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,970
I thought you're the kind that...

317
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,990
However,

318
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,680
I suddenly discovered that...

319
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,240
you're actually a generous guy.

320
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,520
So,

321
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I'm going to...

322
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,520
return this little goose that has drunk...

323
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,880
the memory lost water.

324
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,290
Only this one time.

325
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,400
Yes, sir.

326
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,590
Yes, sir.

327
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,690
That harmonica...

328
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,700
Shi Yi gave this harmonica to me.

329
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,370
Mr Shi.

330
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,140
If there's nothing else,

331
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,670
I'll go take care of Goo Se.

332
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,580
Mr Shi.

333
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,060
Thank you for taking us in.

334
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,540
She carries it wherever she goes.

335
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,400
[Father is partial.]

336
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,380
[You only make a rack for brother.]

337
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,050
[You're big now, you still feel jealous?]

338
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,190
[Don't you like model airplanes?]

339
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,790
[I'll teach you to make one.]

340
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,240
-[Alright.]
-[I want one too.]

341
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,160
[You want one too?]

342
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,140
[I'll do whatever...]

343
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,770
[that you two want.]

344
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,510
-[Alright?]
-[Yes.]

345
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,650
[Good boys.]

346
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,360
Again.

347
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
Goo Se!

348
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,140
Why did you fly up there again?

349
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,060
You're so bad! Come down now.

350
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,680
What if you fall?

351
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,030
It's dangerous.

352
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,440
Come down.

353
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
What are you doing?

354
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,920
Mr Shi, I can explain it, I really can.

355
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,340
Calm down.

356
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,280
It's like this.

357
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,840
I wanted to take Goo Se
to the bathroom.

358
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,220
It must be thinking...

359
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,540
this is such a grand bathroom...

360
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,800
and flew up there.

361
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,870
You must not have...

362
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,760
seen your bathroom from that angle.

363
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,700
Let it tell you when it comes down.

364
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,570
I regret taking you in.

365
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm serious.

366
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,380
I give you a minute.

367
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,700
You and the goose...

368
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,180
get lost immediately!

369
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,040
Don't be anxious.

370
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,240
Let me coax it to come down first.

371
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,000
Goo Se, come down now.

372
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,180
Count down begins.

373
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Goo Se.

374
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,470
I know you want to help me experience
the role of the Lake God.

375
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,500
To feel the feeling of overlooking
your own territory.

376
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,080
I've understood, it's over now.

377
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,420
-Hurry and come down.
-Ten seconds left.

378

Goo Se!

379

Listen.

380
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,250
If you don't come down,

381
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,400
I'll turn you into a bald goose.

382
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,100
Are you afraid now?

383
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,400
I know you're afraid.

384
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,320
Come down now!

385
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,680
Forget it.

386
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,040
Pay the fine.

387
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,300
You brought stranger goose home.

388
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,500
The fine is RMB5,000.

389
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,920
You stained the bathroom.

390
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,960
-I...
-Another RMB5,000.

391
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,520
It still won't come down.

392
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,890
How much do you think I should fine you?

393
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,940
I'll think of a way now.

394
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,820
I'll think of a way.

395
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,350
This.

396
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,290
This.

397
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,770
This, I'll bring it down.

398
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,220
Get down, stand aside.

399
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,010
I'll help you first, Mr Shi.

400
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,530
It's alright, I can do it.

Let Mr Shi help you down.

405
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,040
Then...

406
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,320
-You...
-Shut up.

My goodness.

408
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,320
That was my first kiss.

My harmonica...

I didn't expect this goose
to be so destructive.

I don't know either.

I don't know who did it.

You're still young.

In this world,

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,450
there's a thing...

433
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,160
called hair removal cream.

434
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,290

your feathers...

438
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,640
will fall off one by one.

439
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,710
You'll become a bald chicken.

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,780
Are you afraid now?

442
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,240
Shi Meng instructed me to do it.

you're bound to succeed eventually.

00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,400
Tell me, what else do you want to say?

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,710
It must have escaped by itself.

Not you?

451
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,230
Not you then.

Do you know how important
this harmonica is to me?

454
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,100
This is Shi Yi's harmonica.

458
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,560

460
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,280

Forget it, I'll punish you to be hungry.

Mr Shi, I can't do this anymore.

474
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,270
The opening of the movie
is a sanitary pad advertisement.

475
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,390
Are you joking?

476
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,030
How important is the beginning of a movie?

477
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,230
It's needless to say.

478
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,480
That's the audience's first impression
on our movie.

479

This is great.

480
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,440
You let the audience
walk into the cinema,

turn off the lights,

482
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,130
they want to watch our movie,

483
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,320
but then they saw the words,

485
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,840

486
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,890
-Calm down.
-Calm down, director.

487
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,580
Please wait a moment,
I'll go find out the situation.

488
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,220
Have a seat.

489
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,770
I've never heard of Eight Dimensions.

490
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,160
He goes just like that?

491
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,870
He went to find out the situation.

492
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,830
What situation?

493
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,230
No, he...

494
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,880
-Mr Shi.
-Mr Shi.

495
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,800
-Carry on.
-Alright.

496
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,060
Let's revise it again.

497
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,680
Uncle Gu, you're back.

498
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,490
If I don't come back,

499
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,460
the overspend of The Tale of Water Utopia
will add on a few zeroes more.

500
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,480
A sufficient investment
can produce a quality product.

501
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,740
Naturally, the rewards will be greater.

502
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,530
You put too much affections
on this project.

503
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,480
It's easy to lose the judgement
of a businessman.

504
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,160
Don't worry, Uncle Gu.

505
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,200
I've considered these things.

506
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,580
Xiao Meng.

507
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,760
The safest way now...

508
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,650
is to bring in new advertisers.

509
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,570
You know it well.

510
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,650
For a movie,

511
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,040
such advertisement...

512
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,770
will only destroy its content.

513
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,570
A good director...

514
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,620
can surely find a balance
between arts and business.

515
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,080
If he can't, hire someone else.

516
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,960
Impossible.

517
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,920
The director has been doing this project
for three years.

518
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,050
No one knows the movie better than him.

519
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,330
Stop talking.

520
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,420
Since he has such affection for the movie,

521
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,240
he should be more cooperative
with the clients.

522
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,090
Otherwise, he can be replaced at any time.

523
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,960
This is the new demo of
The Tale of Water Utopia.

524
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,760
How was it?
Give me some advice.

525
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,810
I'm an amateur audience.

526
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,360
I can only rely on my feelings.

527
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,320
I can't give you professional advice.

528
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,760
You're the audience too.

529
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,280
Besides,

530
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,460
you can understand
what I'm trying to express.

531
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,520
You said...

532
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,130
Fang Yan can understand Shi Yi.

533
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
I'll say it then.

534
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,690
I'll really say it.

535
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,180
I think it can be described...

536
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,780
with just one word.

537
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,770
Perfect!

538
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,030
I'm serious.

539
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,960
There are a few blanks
in the middle of your song.

540
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,110
It feels like...

541
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,590
a cathartic feeling...

542
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,700
for the previous emotions, you know?

543
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,830
Did you have new inspirations lately?

544
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,060
Having a soul mate...

545
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,450
is indeed different.

546
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,150
Wait for me.

547
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,840
[He treats you as his soul mate.]

548
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,280
[But you let Goo Se ruin his harmonica.]

549
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,620
[If I ask him for another thing,]

550
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,520
[I'll be shameless.]
