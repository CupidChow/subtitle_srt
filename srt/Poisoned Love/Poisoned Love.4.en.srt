00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,060
but the commoners
can't even light a lamp.

171
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,980
The sound level meter is getting
on my nerves.

172
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm going to switch it out one day.

173
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,640
Control your temper...

174
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,120
Life is but a play.

175
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,720
That bipolar control freak...

176
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,720
should be fine, right?

177
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,920
Hi...

178
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,620
I...

179
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,820
What's his problem?

180
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,920
How ungentlemanly.

181
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,320
Hair removal cream?

182
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,780
Did he actually use it?

183
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
[Hair removal cream.]

184
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Hair removal cream?

185
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,060
I...

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,600
That bipolar guy...

187
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,860
must be furious about yesterday.

188
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,820
I'd better not wake him up.

189
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,420
What if his condition gets worse,

190
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,100
being cooped up in the house?

191
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,940
[I'll think of a way to cheer him up.]

192
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,800
It's morning, Shi Meng. Time to get up.

193
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,480
Why not hit the field instead of the hay?

194
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,960
A healthy body leads to a brighter day.

195
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,500
Make your ambition a reality!

196
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,880
Morning.

197
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,380
Good morning, Mr Shi.

198
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,840
Have a seat.

199
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,320
Today's special breakfast.

200
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,200
Black sesame soup.

201
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,080
Black soy milk.

202
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,480
Black soy bean cookies.

203
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,680
Black beans and pickled greens.

204
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,200
And... three slices of ginger.

205
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,100
-Ginger?
-For external application.

206
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,540
Next,

207
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,000
allow me to present something.

208
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,440
With it,

209
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
all your problems...

210
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,160
will be solved.

211
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,440
Three...

212
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,080
Two...

213
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,320
One.

214
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,920
Get lost!

215
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,860
Take this away.

216
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,020
-Mr Shi.
-Mr Shi.

217
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,000
Check out Mr Shi's new hairstyle.

218
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,360
He looks even more handsome now.

219
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,680
New hairstyle, Mr Shi?

220
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,520
-Mr Shi.
-Mr Shi.

221
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,280
How are the actor's contracts
coming along?

222
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,600
Shi Yi's contract has been signed.

223
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,960
We're in the final stages of negotiation
with the others.

224
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,240
The only one left is Lin Lin.

225
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,600
You see, Lin Lin came with Yi Ming.

226
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,160
She's not our priority in terms of
getting views.

227
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,560
So I'm thinking...

228
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,240
since we haven't finalised her contract,

229
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,840
should we get someone else?

230
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,280
No. Lin Lin has the right skills
and looks for the role.

231
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,040
We have Shi Yi.

232
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
The leading lady's popularity
is a non-issue.

233
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,980
As long as she plays her role properly,

234
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,200
we'll keep her.

235
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
Any questions?

236
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,200
There are still some roles in the show...

237
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,600
that are unfilled. So...

238
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,920
Broaden your search.

239
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,280
Sure. Tell you what,

240
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,680
I'll follow up
with the assistant director.

241
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,200
Okay. I'll leave it to you.

242
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,720
-Okay.
-Mr Shi,

243
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,720
the front desk says Lin Lin is here.

244
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,040
She's waiting for you in the office.

245
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,200
I think she's worried
about being replaced.

246
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,960
If it's alright with everyone,

247
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,180
let's end this meeting.

248
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,640
Okay.

249
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,440
See you, Mr Shi.

250
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,560
That's a nifty hairstyle.

251
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,319
Which hairstylist's handiwork is that?

252
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,640
What's this?

253
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,840
Ginger tea. The weather's getting cold.

254
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,320
Not only does it taste good,

255
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,680
but also prevent colds and hair-loss.

256
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,170
Get out.

257
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,160
[You're fined RMB 10,000.]

258
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,360
RMB 10,000?

259
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,120
No way. All I did was misplace
the shampoo...

260
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,000
and he's not even bald!

261
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,380
This is too much.

262
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,000
Share your thoughts, Ms Fang Yan.

263
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,560
How was your first night staying
with the president?

264
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,720
President?

265
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,520
He's more like a psycho.

266
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,120
My goodness.

267
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,920
What's with him and fines?

268
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Work hard and make money.
Am I right?

269
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,600
[Ten thousand is too much.]

270
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,280
[It's my first offence.]

271
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,780
[Please give me another chance.]

272
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,820

273

[Contract]

274
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,320
Contract!

275
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,320
Sweet!

276
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,320
Look it over. Make sure the terms
are alright.

277
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,120
-Okay.
-Sign it and I'll submit it for you.

278
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,800
See? Everything is going as I've planned.

279
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,360
Treatment-wise, we got Shi Yi.

280
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,120
Career-wise, we got Concept Pictures.

281
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,600
We even got the Lake God gig.

282
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,640
Lake God? The director decided
to take a chance on me?

283
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,760
Of course.

284
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,260
You got the contract, don't you?

285
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,640
Wei Lin, you're the man.

286
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,760
I don't think these roles are suitable...

287
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,220
Director, hold up.

288
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,780
-See you.
-Okay.

289
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,880
Director, this is Yin Jiang.

290
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,440
-Fang Yan.
-Nice to meet you.

291
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,960
-I'm Fang Yan.
-Right.

292
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,760
Yin Jiang? From Vitality Studio?

293
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,260
She just signed up with us.

294
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,120
You have a unique voice.

295
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,000
I like it a lot.

296
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,320
Why didn't you take the ginger tea?

297
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,360
Let's have an interview next week.

298
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,000
Keep it up.

299
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,040
Thanks, Director.

300
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,080
Why did you take a chance on her?

301
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,400
Didn't you say she's only a fan girl?

302
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,280
It's not like you.

303
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,400
She's just a stand-in.

304
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,120
-Mr Shi.
-Have a seat.

305
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,920
Any issues with the contract?

306
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,020
Not at all. It's just that...

307
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,960
Yi Ming and I are from the same company.

308
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,040
Now that he's bowed out,

309
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,760
I...

310
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,120
That's his own business,

311
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,280
not yours.

312
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,640
We don't simply terminate contracts
here at Concept Pictures.

313
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,120
That's very gracious of you.

314
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,000
Still, I have to show...

315
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,680
some form of appreciation.

316
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,480
May I take you out to dinner...

317
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,760
as a token of my gratitude?

318
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,780
Hao Ying Jun, do we have something
on tonight?

319
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,600
Yes. Absolutely...

320
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,800
The sacred moment.

321
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,360
Okay. I'll submit it
to the legal department.

322
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,880
-Got to run.
-See you.

323
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,950
Bye.

324
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,320
Get straight to the point.

325
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,320
Mr Shi, I know I've signed the contract.

326
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,600
But...

327
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't know anyone on my team.

328
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,700
No one to look out for me.

329
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,760
I feel...

330
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,360
so lost.

331
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Your assistant will take care of you
once you're on board.

332
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,760
Mr Shi, can I ask a personal question?

333
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
What type of girls do you like?

334
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,960
-Sorry. Pardon me.
-Come in.

335
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,720
You're dressed so lightly.

336
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,160
-But I'm not cold.
-Yes, you are.

337
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,200
Mr Shi.

338
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,480
I should take care of her. See you.

339
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,440
What was that about?

340
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,780
Forget about the fine.

341
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,040
You moody devil...

342
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,760
Hello, what's up?

343
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,220
[Have you gone?]

344
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,840
Any problem with the contract?

345
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,160
[No.]

346
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,840
[The company wants you
to meet up with Shi Yi.]

347
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,200
[You are now...]

348
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,960
[officially partners.]

349
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,480
What did you say? Partners?

350
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,640
Every time...

351
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,360
you come here for counselling,

352
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,800
you fall asleep instead.

353
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,640
How am I supposed to help you?

354
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
Just lying here is therapeutic enough.

355
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,700
Don't you have anything to say to me?

356
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,040
[Ever heard of a condition...]

357
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,000
[called derealisation parasomnia?]

358
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,240
Ever heard of a condition called...

359
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,920
derealisation parasomnia?

360
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,920
Hi. What a coincidence.

361
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,800
What a coincidence! No...

362
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,320
Isn't this a coincidence?

363
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,920
I didn't expect to see you here.

364
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,320
Yao Yao, your beauty attracts me...

365
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,040
wherever you go.

366
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,960
Don't you think we are...

367
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,680
What are you doing here?

368
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,520
The weather forecast said...

369
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,240
it's perfect for a jog.

370
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,640
So I jogged all the way here.

371
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,000
A good five kilometers.

372
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Get going, then.

373
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,800
I'm here on official business.

374
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,520
No, wait. It's about the re-signing
of the contract.

375
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,640
Close the door and cut to the chase.

376
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,800
Don't play games with me.

377
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,000
Listen to you.

378
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,920
You've hit me,

379
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,440
you've screamed at me.

380
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,780
Shouldn't you feel better by now?

381
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,200
Don't we have a contract to sign?

382
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,480
Or was that a lie, too?

383
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,360
Of course we'll sign the contract.

384
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,680
But can you please...

385
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,560
stop giving me the cold shoulder
every time we meet?

386
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,040
After all, we're old friends.

387
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,380
Who's your old friend?

388
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,360
You're right. You're not my old friend.

389
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,920
You're my first love...

390
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,400
Enough. Let's get down to business.

391
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,120
Tell me, why did you break up with me?

392
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
Is it necessary to harp on
about the past?

393
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Do you really think it's unnecessary...

394
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,840
or are you trying to hide something?

395
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,240
Zuo Yao, you left me back then
without saying a word.

396
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,440
You went years...

397
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,080
without replying to a single message.

398
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,480
If you have nothing to hide,

399
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,940
why won't you talk about it?

400
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,100
Enough. I don't think you're here
for business.

401
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,040
-Take your bag and get out.
-Listen to me...

402
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,560
-Get out.
-What's the matter with you?

403
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,000
But we were so close...

404
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,560
Your Majesty, when can we eat?

405
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,840
-Dad?
-Who are you calling dad?

406
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,680
Why are you grabbing Mum's hand?

407
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,680
Who's your mum?

408
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,480
Her.

409
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,820
I just might be your dad...

410
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,640
Psycho.

411
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,320
Shi... Yi, good day.

412
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,280
Did I frighten you at Aunt Ling's
birthday party?

413
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,560
I didn't mean it.

414
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,580
I don't like you. I'm not your...

415
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,380
It's not that I don't like you.

416
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,720
What I'm saying is I'm not
some crazy fan girl.

417
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
I didn't come here to harass you.

418
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,140
My company asked me to come and see you.

419
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,040
So...

420
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,960
Come in.

421
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,230
Have a seat.

422
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,880
I'm thinking of adding an aside
for Water Utopia's theme.

423
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
Sorry to trouble you.

424
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,680
Thanks. It's no trouble at all.

425
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,040
I'm friends with Dr Cui.

426
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,760
I'd just visited him this morning.
Have a seat.

427
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,080
You know Dr Cui?

428
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,040
During our appointment,

429
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,960
he told me about you.

430
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,880
My condition...

431
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,160
is quite rare.

432
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,400
But I really didn't mean to disturb
you the last time.

433
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,200
It's okay. I'm just a little surprised.

434
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,420
Living all these years without a cure...

435
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
must be hard on you.

436
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,760
Not really. Apart from my episodes
of relapse,

437
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,720
I'm just like a normal person.

438
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,920
Besides my family and close friends,

439
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,640
no one would believe I'm ill
even if I told them.

440
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,200
Have some tea.

441
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,440
-Zuo Yao, will you calm down?
-Get out!

442
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,240
-I have only one question.
-Shoot.

443
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,800
If he's not my son,

444
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,720
why did he call me dad
the moment he saw me?

445
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,400
Besides, I did the math.

446
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,520
Most likely...

447
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,560
you were already pregnant...

448
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,720
before we broke up.

449
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,960
That's pretty quick.

450
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,760
So, tell me.

451
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,520
Why did you insist on leaving me...

452
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
to raise our son all by yourself?

453
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,080
He's not your kid.

454
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,120
Impossible.

455
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,000
Look at his nose, eyes, brows, ears.

456
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,640
Is there any part of him that wasn't made
from the same mould as mine?

457
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,560
Come to think of it, we're nothing alike.

458
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,680
Exactly.

459
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,240
Zuo You, escort the guest out.

460
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,240
Daddy isn't a guest.

461
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,360
Daddy's your most beloved...

462
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,240
You have three seconds.

463
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,080
Don't dilly-dally or I'll call the cops.

464
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,960
Son, say something for me.

465
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,360
This is no way to treat your father,
my son.

466
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,420
Sorry. My mum doesn't want you
as my dad.

467
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,040
Fine.

468
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
Wait for me, my son.

469
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
Listen here, Zuo Yao,

470
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,920
-I'll be back. Wait...
-Get lost.

471
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
What a nuisance.

472
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,600
What are you looking at? Do your homework.

473
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,440
Looks like...

474
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,000
this means war.

475
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Zuo Yao.

476
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,840
Once I get a paternity test,

477
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,600
we'll see who's wrong.

478
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,880
Luckily my son had inherited my superior
genes for hair growth.

479
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,280
If this clump of hair came from my scalp,

480
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,800
it'd be too obvious.

481
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,420
My son, father is sorry.

482
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,060
Just you wait.

483
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,680
That's beautiful.
Is it your new composition?

484
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,690
No.

485
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,840
It's written by Strauss.

486
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,640
How embarrassing.

487
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,760
I couldn't even recognise the work
of the master of waltz himself.

488
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,600
Strauss wouldn't have become a master...

489
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,480
without Lanner.

490
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,920
Lanner?

491
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,520
When Strauss was 15,

492
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,840
he was discovered by Lanner.

493
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,960
With his encouragement,

494
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,080
he began to compose.

495
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,800
Gradually becoming a master.

496
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,320
But his temper grew as well.

497
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,320
One time, he even broke his piano
after an argument with Lanner.

498
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,840
Then what happened?

499
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,680
Then,

500
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,240
he composed a song,
dedicating it to Lanner.

501
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,000
Called "Reconciliation" Waltz.

502
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,200
You're saying...

503
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,680
I'm Lanner,

504
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,680
your soul mate?

505
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,120
We had a falling out because of
a misunderstanding.

506
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,400
So...

507
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,960
you played this song...

508
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,880
as an apology to me?

509
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,880
Who knew...

510
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,480
a musician's apology would be
just as sophisticated...

511
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,480
and cryptic.

512
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,400
If it's too cryptic for you,

513
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,360
let's try something else.

514
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,240
I give you three wishes...

515
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,400
as my apology.
