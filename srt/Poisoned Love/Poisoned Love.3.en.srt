in this room...

10

So, are you guys going to sign it or not?

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,460
Considering you have the minimum
professional requirement,

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,240
we agree to sign.

13

But...

14
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,980
we have one condition.

15
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,080
Say it.

18
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,040
Good to see you.

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,440
You look gorgeous.

The air abroad is definitely better.

Oh, shush.

Listen to you ladies talk.

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,740
Is it because it's my birthday today,

39
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,940
so you're purposely making me happy?

40
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,980
We're being honest, Sister in law

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,210
You have no idea
how exhausted I was...

42
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,000
preparing for my son's wedding.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,040
I felt like I had aged five years.

That's right.

45

I feel the same.

getting married?

52
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,600
They should have a baby
to keep you company.

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
That's right.

Hi there, Xiao Yi.

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,240
This handsome son of mine
makes me worry every day.

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,800
You know, it gets lonely at the top.

59
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,040
It's not so easy to find someone suitable.

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,680
Ms Fang Yan, allow me
to formally introduce to you,

What's this place?

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,880
You wanted to see Shi Yi, right?

64
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,040
-Shi Yi is inside?
-Yes.

65

Today is Madam Ling's birthday.

So, Shi Yi is here.

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,080
Never mind then.

69
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
I didn't prepare a present.

70
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,680
It's rude to come empty-handed.

71
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
I should go, see you.

72
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,880
Hold it.

73
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,450

75
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,500

76

-But I...
-This way, please.

You and your brother.

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,930
Which one of you doesn't make me worry?

79
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,640
Can you be more self aware?

80
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,320
Don't you know how anxious I am
over your relationships?

81
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,120
Mom,

82
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
you said it yourself.

83
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,800
It's lonely at the top.

84
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,800
You little imp.

85
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,600
You just have to upset me.

86
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
My wrinkles are showing.

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
-Look.
-Let me see.

88
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,520
-Gosh.
-It's nothing.

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,480
What do you mean nothing? Bad boy.

90
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,659
Xiao Meng is here.

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,880
Xiao Meng is here?

92
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,600
Mum,

93
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm going to greet other guests.

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,880
Shi Meng.

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,600
You sure took your time, kiddo.

97
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,130
I told you there's traffic.

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,310
Aunt Ling!

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,600
Goodness, Aunt Ling.

100
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
You're looking younger day to day.

101
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,520
You're aging backwards.

102
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,160
My eyes don't lie.

103
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,160
You rascal, you. Such a sweet-talker.

104
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,480
Mum, where's Shi Yi?

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,360
Did you knock your head?
You never looked for your brother.

106
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,520
-I'm not looking for him.
-I didn't prepare anything.

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,960
I should get out of here.

108
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,550
This is...

109
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
A colleague.

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,400
Why haven't I seen her before?

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,440
Hello, aunt.

112
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,120
I'm Fang Yan.

113
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:39,200
I'd like to wish you a happy birthday.

114
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,880
I got you a present.

115
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,200
I hope you like it.

116
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,000
You didn't have to bring gifts.
Just coming is enough.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,330
Such a thoughtful girl.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,920
Unbelievable!

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,080
Isn't this by scarf by Vivenne,
that famous designer?

120
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,960
It's your favourite, Aunt Ling.

121
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,360
Mr Shi mentioned you like her designs.

122
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,680
It's just a little something from me.

123
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
I like it a lot.

124
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,480
Fang Yan, you're so thoughtful.

125
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,680
Where's my present?

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,970
I left it in the office.
I'll get it tomorrow.

127
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,640
You brat, always so absent-minded.

128
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,200
Come, Xiao Yan, come and sit.

129
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,280
This is my...

130
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,400
It's good that you came.

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,320
But receiving a present
is the cherry on top.

132
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,750
Xiao Yan, where are you from?

133
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,000
How many in your family?

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
Do you have any siblings?

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,050
What's your animal zodiac?

136
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,360
How long have you known my son?

137
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,680
What's your zodiac sign?

138
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,159
What do you like to eat?

139
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,960
Do drop by often when you're free.

140
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,300
Remember, okay?

141
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
-Visit often.
-Mum, I need her.

142
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,960
We'll be back later.

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,280
I have to go, aunt.

144
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,040
Sorry, excuse me.

145
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,680
Aunt Ling, this is my present to you.

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,600
I'll leave it here.

147
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,720
Stop right there.

148
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,400
Aunt Ling.

149
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
You got your hair done, didn't you?

150
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,600
Don't try and change the subject.
Sit down.

151
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,640
The thing I asked you to do...

152
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,580
How is it coming along?

153

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,520
Go on.

155
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,240
Wait a minute.

156
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,200
I'm feeling nervous.

157
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,280
I need to get my act together.

158
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,340
What is it with you?

159
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,200
Let me step outside for a bit.

160
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,860

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,630
[This would break
the ice for sure, wouldn't it?]

172
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,360
Gosh, my glasses are dirty.

173
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
Stop avoiding the question.

174
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,320
You can't blame me, aunt.

175
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,180
You know very well how your son is.

176
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,740
Dating and love
are the least of his worries.

177
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,760
Forget about meeting girls.

178
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,960
Not even female mosquitoes go to him.

179
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,960
Listen, you two grew up together.

180
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,960
Your best friend has no love interest.

181
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,420
Aren't you worried at all?

182
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,120
If you put it like that,

183
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm going to be sad.

184
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
I'm still single, too.

185
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,520
So, you mean...

186
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,720
you didn't introduce Xiao Yan
to Xiao Meng?

187
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,640
Who?

188
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,840
Fang Yan...

189
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,360
She is...

190
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,920
Tell me then.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,920
Is Xiao Meng interested in her?

192
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,480
He...

193
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,320
That Xiao Meng.

194
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,800
The girl even came to the house.

195
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,360
He's being too formal with her.

196
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
What if he scares her off?

197
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,400
That wouldn't be good.

198
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,710
Right...

199
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,880
That's...

200
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,750
I think...

201
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,180
You want to do that?

202
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,000
No way. I don't think it's appropriate.

203
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
Just do as I said.

204
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,800
Otherwise...

205
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
What should I do?

206
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,360
What should I do?

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
What if he doesn't believe me?

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,280
If only Yao Yao was here.

209
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,530
She'd be able to give me a pep talk.

210
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,520
Fang Yan.

211
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,400
Why are you so nervous?

212
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,660
In some years, you'd be greater
than you are now.

214
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
But Yao Yao,

215
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
I'm really scared.

216
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm scared that he'd think
I'm a lunatic. What should I do?

217
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,280
Babe, why are you scared
when you're already one?

218
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,040
You're right, Yao Yao.
You make the best sense!

219
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,240
I am a lunatic. Why should I feel scared?

220
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,760
I'll just pretend to be a tree.

221
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,160
I'll go up to him and say,

222
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,160
"Hi, I'm a tree."

223

Whatever.

What is it, Mum?

239
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,880
I came here specifically to see you.

240

Why are you still so nervous?

Will you feel more comfortable
chatting through text?

What about we interact on Weibo instead?

No, it's fine.

246
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,320
Have you heard of a condition...

247
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
called derealisation parasomnia?

248
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,160
Derealisation parasomnia?

249
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,120
That's what I have.

250
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,000
It means...

251
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,350
When you encounter a scary situation,

252
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,280
you will enter into a dream-like state,

253
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,310
and then you'll start walking...

254
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,640
And then you...

255
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,000
I can show you my diagnosis.

256
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,520
This is my diagnosis report.

257

Xiao Meng, you've been back
for a while now.

258
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,880
You should come live at home.

259

-He and I can't live under the same roof.
-It's been so long.

No need to persuade me.

So...

00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,950
You have a weird sleepwalking disorder.

275
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,950
And you need to be with me to treat it?

276

How do you plan to stay with me?

277

I just have to stay with you
as long as possible.

why I need to be with you
to cure this disorder.

280
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,600
You want to stay with me 24/7?

281
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,600
That's right.

282
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,340
It would be best if there is
a position like that.

So, are you expecting a signature now
or a hug?

303
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,520
That's not what I meant.

304

305

When that happens,

Fang Yan would change from
an ugly duckling into a swan.

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,540
and kick me out?

504
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,460
Of course not. No way.

505
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,270
You came to work.

506
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,310
Besides, it's in black and white.

507
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,480
You're not doing anything wrong. Why fret?

508
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,760
This place is huge.

509
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,480
It won't be easy being
the nanny and assistant.

510
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,710
Can't you say something nice?

511
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,490
This place is enormous.

512
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,440
Your good life is about to begin.

513
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,200
Xiao Yan, look at me in the eyes.

514
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,240
From today onwards,
you'll be starting a new life.

515
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,040
Sleepwalking and what not,

516
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,980
they will be gone from your world.

517
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,600
All the best.

518
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,620
All the best.

519
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,600
Little goose, let's work hard together.

520
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,440
You're a little goose too.

521
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,240
In every story,

522
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,410
there will always be a locked door.

523
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,920
And in every story,
the female protagonist...

524
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,240
is always testing her luck by trying
to open the door.

525
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,410
I'm not curious though.

526
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,760
And I won't test my luck.

527
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,840
See you.

528
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,290
Xiao Yan's shampoo and conditioner.

529
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,440
Hair removal cream.

530
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,720
[Delete this song from the memory?]

531
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,840
[Have you heard of a condition...]

532
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,970
[called derealisation parasomnia?]

533
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,390
[Dr Cui]

534
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,040
Hello, Dr Cui?

535
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,980
Are you free tomorrow?

536
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
Let’s have a chat.

537
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,440
Okay.

538
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,840
I've cleaned the whole day.

539
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,800
Finally,

540
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,000
there's only one room left.

541
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,640
Standing here in this space,

542
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,080
I can't help but recite a poem.

543
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,080
Face towards the floor,

544
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,960
back towards the sky.

545
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,920
Kitchen, living room,

546
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,840
bathroom, too.

547
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,080
The road to being cured...

548
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,240
is an arduous one!

549
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,520
But it cannot stop...

550
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,520
Fang Yan.

551
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,780
The bed of a superstar feels totally different.

552
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,490
Such great quality.

553
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,920
So pretty.

554
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,770
Why didn't aunt switch off the lights?

555
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,370
But she cleaned the place really good.

556
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,470
I never would've thought
this is how our first meeting would go.

557
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,360
I hope he won't think of me
as a crazy fangirl again.

558
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,440
What if he chases me out?

559
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,330
Who's there?

560
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,640
I'm sorry...

561
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,360
I'm the new assistant.

562
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,400
I'll be looking after you
around the clock.

563
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,840
I'm embarrassed that this is how
I introduce myself to you.

564
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,640
Don't worry, Shi Yi. I won't say
a word to your fans.

565
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,100
That you have a birth mark on your...

566
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,440
-It's you?
-It's you?
