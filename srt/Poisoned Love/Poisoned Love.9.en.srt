[Episode 9]

4
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,600
Come and sleep.

5
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,120
Sleep like a pig.

6
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,100
What are you doing?

7
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,640
It's dirty here.

8
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,840
Dirty?

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Where?

10
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,520
Let go!

11
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,120
What are you doing?

12
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,280
It's hot.

13
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,390
Still, you can't take off...

14
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,520
your clothes in front of a girl.

15
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,840
I want...

16
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,550
I want to have some water.

17
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,880
Water?

18
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,570
Hurry.

19
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,640
Got it.

20
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,079
You swine!

21
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,840
Here...

22
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,329
Why are you hiding in the closet?

23
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm looking for something.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
Have you found it?

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Yes.

26
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,680
Come out then.

27
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,960
I don't want to.

28
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,200
I want you to sing me a song.

29
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,720
Then I'll come out.

30
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,170
Fang Yan.

31
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,610
What?

32
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,310
You don't want to sing for me.

33
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,880
I'll sing for you then.

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,200
♫ I love shower, it gives me good skin ♫

35

♫ Put on a shower cap, plenty of bubbles ♫

36
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,280
♫ Xiao Yan Yan ♫

37
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,000
♫ Wants to run away ♫

38
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,600
You're crazy!

39
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,600
It smells good.

40
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,510
I got up late. I didn't cook.

41
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,770
Just make do with this.

42
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,600
Please eat.

43
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,250
What happened to your forehead?

44
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,480
I...

45
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,640
I have a rash.

46
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,160
This is the first time...

47
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,420
I heard you can get rash on your forehead.

48
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,960
This is the first time in my life
that I used...

49
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,480
1982 talcum powder.

50
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,040
Isn't this mine?

51
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,160
You forgot?

52
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,960
♫ I love shower, it gives me good skin ♫

53

♫ Wants to run away♫

55
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,040
You... You're out of tune.

56
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,800
If someone...

57
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,520
is a bad drunk,

58
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,710
he should drink more soya milk...

59
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,120
to nourish his brain.

60
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,760
Is that my shelf?

61
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,360
When did you get it back?

62
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,690
I got it back after you left yesterday.

63
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,080
It's fixed and put here this morning.

64
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,480
Because I'm afraid you'll freak out again.

65
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,740
Does this shelf...

66
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,600
have a special meaning for you?

67
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,760
My dad left it to me.

68
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,520
Luckily, I got it back.

69
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,370
I treat you like that,

70
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,590
why do you still care for me?

71
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,120
Because I have a big heart.

72
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Thank you.

73
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
You're welcome.

74
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,080
[It smells good.]

75
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,120
You...

76
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,159
are crazy.

77
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,160
Are you crazy?

78
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,080
Hello, Wei Lin. What's up?

79
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,510
[The sponsor will host
a dinner party today.]

80
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,020
[All the actors will be there.]

81
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,950
A dinner party?

82
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,200
[All the actors are going?]

83
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,810
-[Yes.]
-Okay.

84
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,040
Wait for me.

85
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,960
Xiao Yi, don't worry.

86
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
Xiao Meng is driving me to the airport.

87
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,720
[Okay, Mum.]

88
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,240
[Do call me when you reach there.]

89
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,580
Alright.

90
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,840
-[Okay.]
-Goodbye.

91
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,880
Xiao Meng.

92
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,640
How's your injury?

93
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm fine.

94
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,720
Good.

95
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,450
A great girl like Xiao Yan
is by your side.

96
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,240
I have nothing to worry about.

97
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,400
Mum.

98
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm sorry about what happened...

99
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,890
in the memorial hall yesterday.

100
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,960
You  silly boy.

101
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,000
How can I be mad at you?

102
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,690
I'm going back to Iceland.

103
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,250
You and your brother...

104
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,140
take good care of each other here.

105
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,740
Don't make me worry anymore.

106
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,480
Okay.

107
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,720
Let me know if you need anything there.

108
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,800
I'll send it to you.

109
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,040
I don't need anything.

110
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,800
Bring me a person.

111
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,240
A person?

112
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,580
Who?

113
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,100
The one in your house.

114
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,400
I think...

115
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,040
she's not bad.

116
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,650
You don't want to have more?

117
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,040
No, I have too much.

118
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,350
You're a small eater...

119
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
and you still eat rice.

120
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,080
But...

121
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,840
why does Mr Zheng suddenly
invite everyone to dinner today?

122
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,240
I guess they've come to an agreement...

123
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,120
about the ad placement.

124
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,830
It's getting late.

125
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,110
Mr Shi really...

126
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,000
doesn't take
the signing of the contract seriously.

127
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,440
The dice has been cast.

128
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,640
He'll be here sooner or later.

129
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,960
You're the star today.

130
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,640
I've got it all set up.

131
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,630
I'll surely...

132
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,700
make you feel extremely honoured.

133
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,480
Come, everyone. Please gather round.

134
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,960
Come.

135
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,120
Gather round.

136
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,900
Today...

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,310
is a happy day.

138
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,440
Eight Dimensions...

139
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,270
and Concept Pictures
are going to sign a contract soon.

140
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,040
We'll be family.

141
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,080
To commemorate this collaboration,

142
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,110
I specially made...

143
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,460
a Lake God handcraft...

144
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,560
for Ms Lin Lin.

145
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,280
We've got such a gorgeous female lead,

146
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,520
the movie...

147
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
will definitely be a hit!

148
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
Great!

149
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,860
Thank you, Mr Zheng.

150
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,140
We'll also work very hard, right?

151
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,280
Right.

152
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,960
Come, let's toast...

153
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,500
the most beautiful Lake God.

154
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,600
It looks like Mr Shi
has succumbed to money.

155
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,520
Shi Meng wouldn't do that.

156
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,560
But he didn't say when he'd come.

157
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,680
It's so late now.

158
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,780
I think the deal is off.

159
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,560
Thank you.

160
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,920
Thank you.

161
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,430
Everyone raised their glass...

162
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,540
except her.

163
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,680
What is that about?

164
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,720
Who?

165
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,570
The voice actress of Lake God.

166
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,880
What is she doing here?

167
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,110
By the way,

168
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,560
she seems to be very close to Mr Shi.

169
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,040
[I wonder what type of girl you like.]

170
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,760
[Sorry to disturb you.]

171
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,640
[Get in here.]

172
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,220
[You’re wearing so little on such a cold day.]

173
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,200
[Mr Shi.]

174
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,620
[I worry she'll catch the flu.]

175
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,220
[You can walk yourself out.]

176
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,440
I remember her.

177
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,020
Nina told me...

178
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,360
she's a bit wacky.

179
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,720
Why does Mr Shi...

180
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,600
take a fancy to this kind of girl?

181
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,120
What do you mean?

182
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,400
You mean I'm no better than her?

183
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,960
Ms Lin Lin, that's not what I mean.

184
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,480
Here, congratulations.

185
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,320
I can't stand it anymore.

186
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,540
My stomach hurts.

187
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,870
I have to go number two.

188
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,900
Come back earlier.
I don't know anyone here.

189
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,840
Okay.

190
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,730
Lin Lin.

191
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,800
Come over.

192
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,070
-Mr Zheng.
-May I have the pleasure...

193
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,320
to take a photo with you?

194
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,760
Sure. You've asked.

195
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,160
How can I turn you down?

196
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,400
Here.

197
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,600
Two Lake Gods mean double blessings.

198
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,070
Mr Zheng, if that is the case,

199
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,760
then I must invite
another Lake God in the movie.

200
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,120
Who?

201
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,760
Hold on a second.

202
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,880
Okay.

203
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,600
Sister Lin is calling you.

204
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,060
Sister Lin is calling you.

205
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,250
This is...

206
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,080
Mr Zheng, this is the voice actress
of Lake God.

207
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,610
Come, let's take a photo together.

208
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,600
-Come.
-Come.

209
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,920
Come, join us.

210
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,200
-It'll add more joy.
-Come.

211
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,080
Look at the camera.

212
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,840
One, two, three.

213
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,730
-What's going on?
-What are you doing?

214
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,200
I kindly asked you to take a photo.
What's this about?

215
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,460
-No.
-Even if you scorn Eight Dimensions,

216
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,140
you can't humiliate Mr Zheng this way.

217
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,980
A voice actress has such a hot temper.

218
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,400
What a poser!

219
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,550
I think she's most likely
instigated by Mr Shi.

220
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,040
He didn't come.

221
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,560
I guess he doesn't want
to sign the contract.

222
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,420
If the souvenir goes missing,

223
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,560
Mr Shi won't be able to answer it.

224
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,400
Where is it?

225
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,800
[Shi Meng has done so much
for this movie.]

226
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,930
[I can't give him any trouble.]

227
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,550
-She's willing to do anything for Mr Shi.
-What is she doing?

228
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,660
One moment she tossed it
and the next she picked it up?

229
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,160
I think she's interested in Mr Shi.

230
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,080
I found it!

231
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,760
Alright, stop talking. Mr Shi is here.

232
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,410
Fang Yan.

233
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,200
Are you stupid?

234
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,680
What are you doing? I finally found it.

235
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,990
Shi Meng.

236
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,360
What's this all about?

237
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,620
Don't give me that attitude.

238
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,360
If you do this again,

239
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,900
I'll withdraw my capital.

240
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,240
I came here...

241
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,200
to talk about this with you.

242
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,240
The termination agreement will be sent
to your company tomorrow.

243
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,320
Hao Ying Jun.

244
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,070
-I'll leave it to you.
-Okay.

245
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,570
Let's go.

246
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,280
You...

247
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,560
You're so unappreciative!

248
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,960
What's going on?

249
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,000
He actually...

250
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,080
Just deal with it.

251
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,200
I...

252
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,360
Oh no.

253
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,230
I went to the toilet for a short while
and missed the whole drama.

254
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,000
Change the wet clothes.

255
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,079
Don't catch a flu.

256
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,560
I'll go register for you.

257
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,000
Thank you.

258
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,530
It's so small.

259
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,010
He thinks so little of me.

260
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,000
How does he know my size?

261
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,150
Why does my face feel hot?

262
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,720
Do I have a fever?

263
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,400
36.5 Celsius.

264
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,820
Normal temperature.

265
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,970
Why is she so red in the face?

266
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,080
Any other symptoms?

267
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,140
She was in the cold water
for over one minute.

268
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,760
She kept sneezing on the way here.

269
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,890
And look at her face.

270
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,920
It's so red.

271
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,140
Are you sure she's okay?

272
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,340
Have some ginger soup at home.

273
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,940
You're fine. You can go home.

274
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,560
Doctor, do prescribe
some medicine for her.

275
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,040
Young lady.

276
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,560
You have a good boyfriend.

277
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,020
He cares so much about you.

278
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,600
I... Well...

279
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,830
Let's go and see a surgeon.

280
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,120
What?

281
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,000
You have a wound?

282
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,880
Like this?

283
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,190
Just disinfect it...

284
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,450
and put a plaster on it.

285
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,570
It's better to bandage it.

286
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,480
Let's go.

287
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,880
Mr Shi.

288
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,390
The doctor said
put a plaster on it will do.

289
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,920
What if it gets infected?

290
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,400
No one will cook then.

291
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,560
Have you resolved the problem
with the advertiser?

292
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,910
In fact, I've wanted to terminate
the contract with them.

293
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,710
And I've talked to the director.

294
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,830
So, I jumped into the pool for nothing?

295
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,800
How dare you say so.

296
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,080
Are you as dumb as a pig?

297
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,380
You believe everything others say.

298
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,480
That'll teach you.

299
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,040
Ungrateful.

300
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,000
Done.

301
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,440
Thank you.

302
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,950
Mr Shi, this...

303
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,440
My hand looks...

304
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,600
It looks like a pig's trotter?

305
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,120
It matches you.

306
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,840
I'm a pig?

307
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,560
I'm a pig?

308
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,040
Who am I?

309
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,440
Where do I come from?

310
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,640
Must I have parents?

311
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,480
Who is my mother then?

312
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,400
-Where do I come from?
-Xiao Yan Yan.

313
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,280
Come, take a break and eat something.

314
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,600
Food.

315
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,960
Thank you.

316
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,520
When will you grow up?

317
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,480
Thank you.
It's not that I don't want to grow up.

318
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,120
Shi Meng did this, okay?

319
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,840
Fang Yan,

320
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,280
tell me the truth.

321
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,840
Are you and Mr Shi...

322
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,560
just housemates

323
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,280
Here you go.

324
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,720
Your behaviour has betrayed you.

325
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,980
How did my behaviour betray me?

326
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,450
I choked on the sweet potato, okay?

327
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,720
Don't talk nonsense.

328
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,440
I talk nonsense.

329
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,680
Then you tell me.

330
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,130
Why did you act like that yesterday?

331
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,880
You fought so hard for Mr Shi
in full view of the crowd.

332
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,480
You don't have a crush on him?

333
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,220
What a joke.
How'd I have a crush on the devil?

334
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,440
What a joke.

335
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,120
Then why did you do that?

336
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,760
To repay my debt.

337
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,220
Plus he helped me take care of Goo Se.

338
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,930
I always settle my scores.

339
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,560
But he helped me,
so I have to return the favour.

340
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,380
Mr Shi helped take care of Goo Se?

341
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,910
He must have fallen for you.

342
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,960
Xiang Wei Lin.

343
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,960
If you talk nonsense again,
I'll kick you hard.

344
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,760
Sister, you're so fierce.

345
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,440
If Mr Shi doesn't like Fang Yan,

346
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,280
why did he bandage her like this?

347
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,790
Does Shi Meng have common sense?

348
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,960
He bandaged a small wound like this?

349
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,230
It's unbreathable.

350
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,960
-Let me untie it.
-No.

351
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,300
This is Mr Shi's token of appreciation.

352
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,700
What token?
I think he's a male chauvinist pig.

353
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,720
No. No.

354
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,560
He's not a male chauvinist pig.

355
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,120
You didn't see
how he rescued Fang Yan yesterday.

356
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,840
It's so cool.

357
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,160
Fang Yan.

358
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,510
You're not allowed...

359
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,470
to get hurt without my permission.

360
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,480
Stop.

361
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,970
You watch too many romance dramas.

362
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,840
You're a moron. Wait...

363
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,360
I haven't sorted you out.

364
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,130
You're at the event that day.

365
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,480
Where did you go?

366
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,480
Xiao Yan Yan suffered because of you.

367
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,720
Come on.

368
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,010
If I didn't slip away,

369
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,770
the hero wouldn't get to save his girl.

370
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,560
You're so cheeky.

371
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,290
Sister, here you go.

372
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,350
-Save his girl?
-That's more like it.

373
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,670
[Yangtangxia. I come here
to work today, I'll wait for you]

374
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,960
Shi Yi.

375
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,120
There you are.

376
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,160
Why are you in there?

377
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,120
Sit down first.

378
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,470
There's no one here.

379
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,450
I thought I came to the wrong place.

380
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,680
Thank you.

381
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
What's the occasion today?

382
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,640
Have some soup first.

383
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,080
It's hot.

384
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,380
Does it taste good?

385
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,080
So good!

386
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,430
Why do you suddenly want
to come here for soup?

387
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,560
When I was a kid...

388
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,080
living in Iceland,

389
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,390
my mum missed
the taste of hometown very much.

390
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,720
So, my dad travelled around Iceland...

391
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,280
and found...

392
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,240
an authentic Chinese restaurant.

393
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,780
The lady boss
made delicious pig's trotter soup.

394
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,960
The taste...

395
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,640
is similar to this.

396
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,520
Your parents are so romantic.

397
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,080
Have some more.

398
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,880
Do we have a job later?

399
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,640
The job today is...

400
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,000
to recuperate.

401
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,000
So, you brought me here
to have pig's trotter soup because...

402
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,880
Like nourishes like.

403
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,440
Very nice.

404
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,960
It's so yummy.

405
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,200
How to make pig's trotter soup?

406
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,190
[Mum]

407
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,680
-[Hello.]
-Hello, Mum.

408
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,840
Well...

409
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,420
Teach me how to make pig's trotter soup.

410
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,220
[Why are you making this?]

411
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,360
[You don't cook. Where is Fang Yan?]

412
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,680
Fang Yan.

413
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,360
She hurt her hand.

414
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,240
[Like nourishes like.]

415
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,090
[You're making it for Fang Yan?]

416
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,630
-Mum.
-[Alright, I won't make fun of you.]

417
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,900
[Xiao Meng cares about other people now.]

418
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,240
[Listen. First, wash the pig's trotter.]

419
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,280
It's done.

420
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,360
It tastes good.

421
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,520
Why is she not back yet?

422
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,370
Shi Yi, thank you.

423
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,080
I'm so envious
of your parents' love story.

424
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,520
Fang Yan.

425
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,330
Can I ask you a question?

426
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,120
What type of guy do you like?

427
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,920
I...

428
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,280
Because of my illness,

429
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,690
I've never been in a relationship before.

430
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,830
I don't know what it is like
to be in love with someone.

431
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,040
Shi Yi.

432
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,500
What's it like to be in love with someone?

433
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
You just want to see his smile.

434
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,280
You don't want him to get hurt.

435
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,360
And...

436
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,660
you want to see him badly.

437
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,760
Because when you do,

438
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,000
you'll be full of joy.

439
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,880
When you're with her,

440
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,430
you want to share
all your truest feelings.

441
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,480
And present her your truthful self.

442
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,940
When you're in love with someone,

443
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,000
you want him to know your feelings...

444
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,200
and wonder...

445
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,880
if she is on the same page.

446
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,000
Troublesome. It's too complicated.

447
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,600
I think you should say it out loud...

448
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,270
if you're in love with someone.

449
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,480
Just go for it if you like her.

450
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,130
-It's hard, right?
-Why it's bandaged like this?

451
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,730
I thought it wasn't serious?

452
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,200
This?

453
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,790
It's because of the devil.

454
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,920
He insisted on bandaging me like this.

455
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,680
Let me remove it.

456
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,280
The devil.

457
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,040
Why is he here?

458
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,120
Shi Yi, I've got to go.

459
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,500
Shi Yi, I'm getting off.

460
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,920
Why are you here?

461
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,950
Can't I go out for a walk?

462
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,160
Sure.

463
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,440
Ridiculous.

464
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,360
It smells so good.

465
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,840
Did you make the pig's trotter soup?

466
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,400
I should have had lesser soup just now.

467
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,800
You already had it?

468
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,130
Then I'll dispose of it.

469
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,280
Why?

470
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,280
You just made it. What a waste.

471
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,080
I'm not full.

472
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,720
I still can have some more.

473
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,950
Why did you suddenly want
to make pig's trotter soup?

474
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,440
I have a craving for it.

475
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,440
It smells good.

476
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,250
It's not as good as what I used to have.

477
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,880
I lived in Iceland when I was a kid.

478
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,720
There's a Chinese restaurant...

479
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,250
and the lady boss cooked
the most authentic pig's trotter soup.

480
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,560
Yours also tastes good.

481
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,040
You have more then.

482
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,640
Okay.

483
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,640
It tastes good.

484
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,840
I'll eat.

485
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,840
Have you dated anyone before?
