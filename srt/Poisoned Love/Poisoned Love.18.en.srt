[Poisoned Love]

3
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,850
[Episode 18 ]

4
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,720
Fang Yan.

5
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,930
Your official announcement,

6
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,790
why didn't you discuss it with us?

7
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,400
I didn't think so much,

8
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,000
and I can help promote the movie.

9
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,280
Furthermore,

10
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,120
I want the best for the movie.

11
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,410
You want the best for it?

12
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,230
You think I don't know what you want?

13
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,090
If you make the official announcement,

14
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,490
you'll be labelled as Shi Yi's girlfriend.

15
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,450
It'll be over for you and Shi Meng.

16
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,800
Stop it.

17
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,500
I have already decided.

18
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,720
Fine. Tell me what's your next step?

19
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,520
This...

20
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,800
I need to discuss with Shi Yi.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,550
You are using moral kidnapping...

22
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,210
to force her into submission,

23
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,500
and to keep her by your side.

24
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,960
Aren't you?

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,560
In your eyes,

26
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,500
if the way I am protecting her
is moral kidnapping,

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,460
then I have nothing to say.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,130
You promised to let me take care of her,

29
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,230
you should let go of
your feelings entirely.

30
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,960
I promised to push her away,

31
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,950
so she can stay with you
and treat her illness,

32
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,330
not let you bind her feelings
by using this method.

33
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,330
She's free to express her feelings.

34
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,200
This is only your wishful thinking.

35
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,960
I seek her opinion in all my decisions.

36
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,700
The one who's not willing to let go...

37
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,560
is you.

38
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,060
Are you sure about this?

39
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,440
Well then,

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,800
one more thing.

41
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,120
Move in with me.

42
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,840
I mean,

43
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,280
if we make an official
announcement about us,

44
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,800
we must make it believable.

45
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,120
Furthermore,

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,250
the security in Zuo Yao's
residential area is not perfect,

47
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,980
I'm afraid you may be in danger.

48
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,560
If you move in with me,

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,040
nobody will disturb you.

50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,840
It seems to have affected
Zuo Yao and Zuo You's lives.

51
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,560
-But I...
-Don't worry.

52
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,020
My house is huge, I have several bedrooms.

53
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,080
Perhaps,

54
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,780
it can be a rented room.

55
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,909
How does that sound?

56
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,690
[Anyway, the official announcement
is just for show.]

57
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,159
[We shouldn't involve
Zuo Yao and Zuo You.]

58
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,040
[Looks like that's my only option.]

59
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Come in.

60
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,400
-Thank you.
-Come in.

61
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,920
Okay.

62
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,040
I can show you around.

63
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,640
There are bedrooms upstairs.

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,760
Okay.

65
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,640
Come with me.

66
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,370
This is...

67
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,670
This is my mum's room.

68
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,760
You can stay in this room if you want.

69
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,000
No, I am good.

70
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,360
I can't stay in Aunt Ling's room.

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,840
Let's go to second floor.

72
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
Okay.

73
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,750
There are two rooms on the second floor,

74
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,120
there are more on third floor.

75
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,270
It's fine.

76
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,360
I...

77
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,160
I can take this one.

78
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,200
Can I?

79
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,280
All right.

80
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,100
Let me help you move your things inside.

81
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,400
I can do it myself.

82
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,800
Thank you.

83
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,360
I shall go in first.

84
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,340
-[I've arranged with public relations.]
-Okay.

85
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,600
[By the way,]

86
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,200
[Fang Yan has moved in with Shi Yi.]

87
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,920
Got it.

88
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,720
[I have the best elder brother
in the world since I was little.]

89
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,200
[We watched gosling hatched.]

90
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,490
[We watched the stars together.]

91
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,350
[Played red light, green light.]

92
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,690
[We went on adventure together.]

93
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,280
[One day,]

94
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,480
[he left me.]

95
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,040
[I couldn't find my way home.]

96
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,680
[I was locked up in a little house.]

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,040
[Looks like...]

98
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,320
[this is Shi Meng's room.]

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
[Inside the house,]

100
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,500
[there was a little girl.]

101
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,800
[In order to calm her down,]

102
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
[I sang her a nursery rhyme.]

103
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,800
[I told her,]

104
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,800
[I am Shi Meng Jun.]

105
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,600
Shi Meng.

106
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,200
Shi Meng Jun.

107
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,840
A dream eater.

108
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Why does it sound so familiar?

109
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,360
[Finally, I escaped.]

110
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,679
[But I have never seen her again.]

111
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,920
[After that,]

112
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,280
[Dad left me].

113
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,320
[I was kidnapped
when I was eight years old.]

114
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,770
[When you were locked in that dark room,]

115
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,560
[you must be scared.]

116
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,680
[The scarier part was,]

117
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,810
[when I escaped and returned home,]

118
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,960
[I found out my father
went looking for me,]

119
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,600
[and he disappeared.]

120
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,320
[Ever since that incident,]

121
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,960
[I dare not sleep with the lights off.]

122
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,860
[Shi Meng]

123
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,820
Did you sleep well last night?

124
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,560
Yes. Why are you up so early?

125
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,070
I am going to the studio today,

126
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,380
thought of making you breakfast,

127
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,580
and I couldn't sleep.

128
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,960
You don't have to do this,

129
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,400
I can order food delivery.

130
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,860
It's nothing. Have a seat.

131
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,400
You are a public figure now,

132
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,800
you must be careful.

133
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,790
You can't simply order delivery.

134
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,560
Are you afraid
your fans will terrorise me?

135
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,160
Yes.

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,320
You are very important now.

137
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,380
Take your meals at home,
don't let anyone enter the house.

138
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,560
I am going off now.

139
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,040
I am going off now.

140
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,640
Bye-bye.

141
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,720
Bye-bye.

142
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,480
Does he think I can eat a lot?

143
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,000
Does he think I am a pig?

144
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,680
Fang Yan.

145
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,840
What are you doing here?

146
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,400
I...

147
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,560
Where is Shi Yi?

148
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,720
He left.

149
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
I'll wait for him.

150
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,520
Leave it, you are very clumsy.

151
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,040
Did you say I am clumsy?

152
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,240
You are...

153
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,040
Don't deny it.

154
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,240
Stand up.

155
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,360
I...

156
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,000
I told you to leave it.

157
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,120
Sit down.

158
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,640
Looks like you are not a good cook.

159
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,240
Shi Yi left without eating.

160
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
Shi Yi cooked these.

161
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,560
Have you had breakfast?

162
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,870
Do you want breakfast?

163
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
I want coffee.

164
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
Coffee?

165
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,680
I don't know where the coffee is.

166
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,320
In the kitchen,

167
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,530
inside the cabinet.

168
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,440
Okay.

169
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,600
I can't seem to get rid
of you no matter where I go.

170
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,680
What did you say?

171
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,280
Nothing.

172
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,920
I was talking to the coffee.

173
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,280
Coffee.

174
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
I found it.

175
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,720
Your coffee.

176
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,760
I am sorry,

177
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,040
I was hungry.

178
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,720
The coffee...

179
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
You can have it.

180
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,440
Are you full?

181
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,400
I am full.

182
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,400
Have some more?

183
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,520
Next time.

184
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,200
Why would someone send me a parcel?

185
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,010
What are you doing?

186
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,040
Don't move.

187
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,920
Don't simply answer the door.

188
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
I...

189
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,840
Hey, that parcel belongs to...

190
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,880
me.

191
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,660
[Leave Shi Yi or I'll kill you.]

192
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,490
Hello, did the courier company
manage to trace it?

193
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,040
[The courier company
have already checked.]

194
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,839
[The sender's address is fake.]

195
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,210
[The security department...]

196
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,010
[will check with those
who know Shi Yi's address.]

197
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,599
What about the journalist?

198
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,119
[Didn't Shi Yi's public relations
department check on this?]

199
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,760
[I told K about this.]

200
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,580
[She said she'll let me know soon.]

201
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,920
Follow-up with public relations again.

202
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,250
And think of a way...

203
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,070
to get the CCTV recording
near the courier drop off point.

204
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,730
See if you can find some clues.

205
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,480
[I'll go check on it.]

206
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,280
Okay, understand.

207
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,960
I'll talk to Brother Shi Yi.

208
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,360
This is reckless.

209
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,920
There's no announcement yet,

210
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,250
and fanatic fans are launching an attack.

211
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,160
We can't hype this news anymore.

212
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,320
The fans are unhappy...

213
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,520
not because I am dating Fang Yan

214
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,980
but they think Fang Yan
is not fit to be my girlfriend.

215
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,680
If that's the case,

216
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,280
why don't we hype it up?

217
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,010
Strengthen her persona,

218
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,080
create more news to market Fang Yan.

219
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,240
I want them to love Fang Yan,

220
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,320
to accept Fang Yan as my girlfriend.

221
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,500
But this...

222
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,710
It won't take long to nurture our fans.

223
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,640
The public relations department...

224
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,620
has released the news various times.

225
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,260
If we withdraw the announcement now,

226
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,160
the fans will make wild guesses.

227
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,320
It is to our advantage.

228
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,470
-Brother Shi Yi.
-That's enough.

229
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,480
Call public relations...

230
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,520
and tell them...

231
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,180
I'll arrange it personally.

232
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,560
Brother Shi Yi!

233
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,320
Hello.

234
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,560
[The police is involved.]

235
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,770
[They traced the source
of the photos to Ni Na.]

236
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,520
[But Ni Na said she was careless,]

237
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,050
[she posted the photos
but not the scary toy.]

238
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,270
[According to the courier,]

239
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,130
[the information given is fake.]

240
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,150
Get security to send me
all the information.

241
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,180
[Give me your hand.]

242
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,880
Didn't you say I am troublesome?

243
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,240
Why do you care for me?

244
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,640
[Don't simply answer the door.]

245
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,800
What does he want to do?

246
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,240
Why can't I open the door?

247
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,080
Shi Yi, is that you?

248
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,480
Shi Yi.

249
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,240
[Don't simply answer the door.]

250
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,400
Oh no, I left my cell phone downstairs.

251
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,280
-Don't come near me.
-It's me, Sister Fang Yan.

252
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,820
-Sister Fang Yan.
-I...

253
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,280
Don't come near me.

254
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,000
I am sorry, I didn't know you were here.

255
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,440
How did you come in?

256
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,090
I have the house key.

257
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,510
-Thank you.
-It's for you.

258
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,750
I am sorry about just now.

259
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,520
I was scared.

260
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,520
-Are you all right?
-I am fine.

261
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,960
I rang the doorbell.

262
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,200
Maybe you didn't hear.

263
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,520
I was upstairs.

264
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,840
It was scary just now.

265
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,370
Luckily, it was you.

266
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,000
I am here to collect
Brother Shi Yi's demo.

267
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,600
No hurry, have a sip of water first.

268
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
Okay.

269
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,360
Xiao K

270
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,760
how long have you been Shi Yi's assistant?

271
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,760
I started since
I graduated from university.

272
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,200
To be more accurate,
I started before I graduated.

273
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,780
I was already his fan
when I was in school.

274
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,930
Everyone in the dormitory was his fan.

275
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,440
You have stayed by
his side for so many years,

276
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,920
and you are a fan too.

277
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,440
Of course.

278
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,400
Brother Shi Yi is our idol.

279
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,320
Every single since his debut,

280
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,170
I've played it countless times.

281
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,520
I never missed his concert.

282
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,280
I am willing to do anything for him.

283
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,640
Even if I can only watch from afar,

284
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,440
I am happy.

285
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,120
Fans...

286
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,330
They don't like their idols
to engage in a relationship?

287
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Sister Fang Yan.

288
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,880
Do you know there's
a saying amongst the fans?

289
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,390
When the idol falls in love,

290
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,000
he will be decapitated.

291
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,930
I am joking, Sister Fang Yan.

292
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,080
Don't be scared.

293
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,020
Aren't you looking for the demo?

294
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,350
Where is it? I'll get it.

295
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,000
It's in Brother Shi Yi's black bag.

296
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,250
His black bag.

297
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,480
Come in.

298
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,480
Mr Shi.

299
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,600
You requested...

300
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,880
all the information about the scandal.

301
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,960

Why ask about her?

I want to know where she is.

[She went to my house
to get something for me.]

You spread the news on internet.

You took photos of
me and Shi Yi, didn't you?

Is there a misunderstanding?

Shi Yi and I are friends.

328

You don't deserve to call his name.

Since you came,

did you know it's not easy?

00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,400
[she missed her oral defence
to interview as your assistant.]

342
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,330
[She didn't get her certificate.]

343
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,600
[She's the president of your fan club,]

344
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,600
[she has made a mark for herself.]

345
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,860
[When news of you
and Fang Yan leaked out,]

346
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,160
[she publicly announced...]

347
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,360
[to boycott Fang Yan.]

348
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,600
That's right.

349
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,760
I like him.

350
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,840
It's unconditional love.

351
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,600
The one thing I want to do most...

352
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,400
is to help him become
the superstar of the century.

353
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,880
But you...

354
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,200
You ruined everything.

355
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,360
You want to say I'll go to jail?

356
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,640
That's fine, I don't care.

357
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,600
The most meaningful thing in my life,

358
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,210
is to be with Brother Shi Yi.

359
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,440
But you...

360
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,960
You ruined all my dreams for Shi Yi.

361
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,110
I can't stay by his side anymore.

362
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,740
Everything is meaningless now.

363
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,210
I want you to return Shi Yi to me.

364
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,400
Fang Yan!

365
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,830
Don't be afraid, the police are on the way.

366
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,970
The police are on their way.

367
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,090
Don't be afraid.

368
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,320
Are you hurt?

369
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,440
You made me do this!

370
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,840
Calm down, K.

371
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,920
Stop moving,

372
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,300
or we'll die together.

373
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,000
K,

374
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,480
put it down.

375
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,360
You forced me to do this.

376
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,800
As long as this woman is with Shi Yi,

377
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,480
I can't do anything.

378
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,180
-Today, I...
-You misunderstood, K.

379
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,600
Fang Yan loves me.

380
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,240
-I love her too.
-This is not true.

381
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,680
She loves Shi Yi,

382
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,440
and Shi Yi is attracted by her.

383
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,840
She really loves me.

384
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,320
Calm down.

385
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,040
Are you trying to buy time?

386
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,550
Didn't you say you love her?

387
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,160
Prove it to me.

388
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,960
If you love him,

389
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
prove it to me now.

390
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,840
The person I love is really him.

391
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,440
Liar!

392
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,160
-It's all right.
-Are you all right?

393
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,320
Liars! Don't pretend in front of me.

394
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,880
Do you think I am stupid?

395
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,510
-K.
-You hurt me,

396
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,080
you hurt Shi Yi.

397
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,320
You'll ruin Shi Yi.

398
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,000
Go to hell, all of you.
