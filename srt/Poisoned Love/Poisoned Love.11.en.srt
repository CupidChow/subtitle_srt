Even masters
will make some mistakes, right?

165
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,120
Let me do it again.

166
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,810
Let's go.

167
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,070
Zuo's mother

168
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,680
please take a look at this.

169
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,760
I'd suggest that...

170
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,560
you don't pick these few activities.

171
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,120
Because they require fathers to partner
with their children.

172
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,840
Miss, I can do it.

173
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,200
I can be the father.

174
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,430
I exercise regularly.

175
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,360
I'm good. My stamina is
just as good as theirs.

176
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,160
All right then. Give me the form, please.

177
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,270
Thank you.

178
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,110
Did you get carsick?

179
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,520
Your body is too weak.

180
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,870
What are we doing here?

181
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,240
Let's skate.

182
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,780
We come all the way here for
this small rink.

183
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,960
There are lots of rinks in town.

184
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,160
This rink...

185
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,410
is special to me.

186
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,880
When I was young, I always passed by...

187
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
this place after school.

188
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,400
My parents were worried
that I might get hurt.

189
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,560
So, I didn't get the chance
to skate on this rink.

190
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,280
Three years. I passed by this place
every day for three years.

191
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,240
But I didn't get the chance to enter
this ice-rink, not even once.

192
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,040
Was it because of the vertigo?

193
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,840
Although they were exaggerated,

194
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,630
they did that for my own good.

195
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
But I really would like to skate
even just for one time.

196
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,100
What is it?

197
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,460
Nothing.

198
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,440
Come on. Try to stand up on your own.

199
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,270
Stand straight.

200
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,840
I'm standing straight.

201
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,040
Relax. I'm going to let go.

202
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,110
No.

203
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,320
I won't let you fall down. Come on.

204
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,450
Come on.

205
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,000
Bend your knees a little bit.

206
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,520
Look into the distance.

207
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Don't stare at your legs.

208
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,960
Open up your legs.

209
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,470
Let me hold your hands.

210
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,079
Take it slow.

211
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,670
Right.

212
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,609
Come on.

213
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,319
No. Don't let go.

214
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,960
Trust yourself. I'm right in front of you.

215
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,430
Come here.

216
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,000
Come here, children.

217
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,360
Please come here, everyone.

218
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
Please gather here.

219
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,030
The games...

220
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,480
will begin at 3.00 p.m.

221
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,400
-Are you happy?
-Yes.

222
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,320
You guys are happy!
Go and help your parents pitch the tent.

223
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,240
Be careful.

224
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,440
Zuo You, is that a summer tent?

225
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,640
It'll be very cold at night.

226
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,190
Zuo You, do you need my dad's help?

227
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,310
My dad is good at this.

228
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,800
We've finished pitching our tent.

229
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,880
It's over there.

230
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,790
I'm fine.

231
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,830
-Here you go.
-All right. Thank you.

232
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,720
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,760
You skated gracefully just now.
Can you teach us how to skate?

234
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,640
I'm sorry.
I've a dumb student waiting for me.

235
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,560
I can't manage it.

236
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,360
Put this on.

237
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,320
You're exaggerating.

238
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,240
I can only find children's
safety gear here.

239
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,720
I was worried that your head
is too big that it can't fit.

240
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,230
My head is too big?

241
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,830
Are you kidding me?

242
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,510
You've a big bald head.

243
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,840
What did you just say?

244
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,960
How did my head become bald?

245
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,520
I haven't punished you for
the hair removal cream incident.

246
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,500
Forgive me, please.

247
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,200
You didn't realise that...

248
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,550
you've become so masculine...

249
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,710
after you got a new hair style.

250
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,390
I'm not going to waste
my time talking to you.

251
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,360
I haven't punished you for disguising
yourself as a ghost just to scare me.

252
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,960
You still remember that incident.

253
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,240
I was just whispering.
How did you hear it?

254
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,880
There's an echo.

255
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,910
Really?

256
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,510
No. Hello.

257
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,440
Hello.

258
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,870
You're lying again.

259
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,860
You tricked me again.

260
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,020
Don't go.

261
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,440
Come on. I'll guide you.

262
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,640
Remember the skills that I taught you
just now. Try it again.

263
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,400
Can I hold your hands?

264
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,600
You'll never master the skills
if you keep holding my hands.

265
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,000
Remember what I've taught you.

266
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,380
Don't worry. I won't let you fall down.

267
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,760
-I'll be by your side.
-[Can you stay by my side forever?]

268
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,940
Come on.

269
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,300
Are you daydreaming?

270
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,440
No.

271
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,520
-Let's try it again.
-Now?

272
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,040
Try it again. Try to skate on your own.

273
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,200
[Thank you...]

274
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,640
[for giving me a perfect first love.]

275
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,400
Here. Give it to me.

276
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,280
Sorry.

277
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,680
I'm late.

278
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,640
-What are you doing here?
-What am I doing here?

279
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,040
I'm here to help Zuo You take over
the winter camp. Am I right?

280
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,450
Come with me.

281
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,380
Come with me.

282
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,500
What's wrong?

283
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,670
What's wrong?

284
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,950
Did I not make myself clear last time?

285
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,440
We even did a DNA paternity test.

286
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,350
What are you still doing here?

287
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,360
Zuo Yao,

288
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,640
I can't let you go.

289
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,630
And I can't let Zuo You go as well.

290
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,360
Back then, you always said that
I was irresponsible...

291
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,280
and that I wasn't ambitious.

292
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,560
I'm here today to tell you that...

293
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,240
from now on...

294
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,060
Zuo You and your ambitions
are my ambitions.

295
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,560
It's my obligation to help you
fulfil your ambitions.

296
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,670
Hold on.

297
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,030
I know that you don't trust me.

298
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,720
But can you give me a chance, please?

299
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,000
Just give me a chance.

300
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,520
Fine. Even if I trust you,

301
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,060
it's hard to earn my son's trust.

302
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,250
Well...

303
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,750
So, you can take part in the activities
in the afternoon,

304
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,240
-right?
-Of course.

305
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,080
I'm here to help you win, okay?

306
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,450
Let's see.

307
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,760
Right. The next activity...

308
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,480
is called back-to-back tug of war.

309
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,480
Zuo You and Ding Yi's family
will do a demonstration.

310
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,360
And I'll explain rules for the game.

311
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,560
When you hear the whistle,

312
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,120
the two fathers who are standing
in the middle...

313
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,760
will start pulling back to back.

314
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,000
Each of them holds
a sticker in their hands.

315
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,800
Whoever places the sticker on
his child's chest first wins.

316
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Ready?

317
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,530
Three,

318
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,590
two,

319
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
-one.
-Hold on.

320
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Bro, did someone tell you that
you look like an actor?

321
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,080
-Me?
-Think about it.

322
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,760
You look familiar to me.

323
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,440
Did someone tell you that
you look like Zhang Fei...

324
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,880
-from The Romance of Three Kingdoms?
-Yes.

325
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,600
How about Black Whirlwind in Water Margin?

326
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,480
Oh yes!

327
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,800
These aren't the closest.

328
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,080
You really look like...

329
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,920
Zhu Ba Jie in Journey to The West.

330
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,470
Three, two...

331
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,000
-Do you know that you look like an actor?
-Yes.

332
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,750
-I look like Eddie Pang.
-Who?

333
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,110
Come on!

334
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,080
Come on!

335
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,080
Zuo You.

336
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,760
Zuo You!

337
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,790
Zuo You!

338
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,520
We won.

339
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,930
I'm sorry that I couldn't help you
win the game.

340
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,660
-This is for you.
-I...

341
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,330
Hey...

342
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Are you out of your mind?

343
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,680
Why did you work so hard in the game?

344
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,680
I just want you two to be happy.

345
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,810
Does it hurt?

346
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,240
More.

347
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,520
It hurts.

348
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,790
I have to drive later.

349
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,770
This is for you.

350
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,080
Is this trotter soup?

351
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,510
You cooked it?

352
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,000
Of course, it's not as delicious as...

353
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,200
the one with your secret recipe.

354
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,990
But I have my secret weapon too.

355
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,800
[The trotter soup is here.]

356
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,040
[Xiao Meng, finish all the trotter soup.]

357
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
[It'll help you grow taller.]

358
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,720
[You'll be taller than
your older brother.]

359
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,280
It's the voice of the owner
of the restaurant.

360
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,280
How did you find the restaurant?

361
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,630
Aunt told me about it.

362
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,520
She told me that you and your family...

363
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,480
would always go to this restaurant...

364
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,470
to have the trotter soup
when you were in Iceland.

365
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,840
You'd also go there for
the trotter soup...

366
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,760
when you were unhappy.

367
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,240
So, she decided to learn
how to cook the trotter soup...

368
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,360
from the owner of the restaurant.

369
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,160
Taste it now.

370
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,560
See if it tastes like the one
you used to have in Iceland.

371
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,820
Brother, come look at the Southern Lights.

372
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,870
It's breathtaking.

373
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,650
Thank you.

374
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,480
You're welcome.

375
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
I'm glad that you like it.

376
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,080
Why are you being so kind to me?

377
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,520
I'm mean to you.

378
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,410
No, you're not mean to me.
You're kind to me.

379
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,730
It's just that you're strict.

380
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,960
You're strict with me sometimes.

381
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,450
Well, if I don't do that...

382
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,240
you'd never learn to be better.

383
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,320
Well, time flies. The two months' time
is going to be over soon.

384
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,000
Do you have any advice for me...

385
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,200
so that I can learn to be a better person?

386
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,440
No.

387
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,680
I just feel that...

388
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,950
finally you're leaving.

389
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,890
My house will be peaceful again.

390
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,160
You're a cold-hearted demon.

391
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,000
How about you?

392
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,960
Do you have anything to say to me?

393
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,880
Yes, I do.

394
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,440
I'd like to thank you...

395
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,750
for torturing me for the last two months.

396
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,720
Not only that you helped me
be more efficient in my work,

397
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,680
you also helped me improve my stamina.

398
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,090
The two months' time is about to end.

399
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,520
I'll express...

400
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,650
my gratitude...

401
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,350
by moving out of your house.

402
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,200
What did my mum give you?

403
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,920
Why are you so loyal to her?

404
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,520
Aunt...

405
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,160
told me that if I could
manage to complete my task,

406
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,920
she'd give me a big reward.

407
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,920
Have you completed your task yet?

408
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,830
Now,

409
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,080
I have.

410
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,240
Aunt wants me to...

411
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,920
test your...

412
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,640
To verify...

413
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
What did she want you to verify?

414
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,600
She wants me to verify your sexuality.

415
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,920
You can't do that to other people.

416
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,610
It's not working.

417
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,040
Let's go. What are you doing?

418
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,770
Do you not want to look at the stars?
