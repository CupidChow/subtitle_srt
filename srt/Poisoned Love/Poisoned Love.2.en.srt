00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,640
-Take a shelter.
-Sure.

-Let me hold it.

Do you like Shi Yi?

This...

17
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,680
is Shi Yi's first album.

18
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,530
His music style is
so different now than this.

19
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,680
There was a unique story
behind this composition.

Anything but Shi Yi's

You're not interested in Shi Yi?

Is there music that comes with narration?

23
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,420
Yeah, of course.

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,480
Which is your favourite?

25
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,600
My favourite album...

26
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
This one. The hit song,

27
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,080
"Destined" has a male singing voice
and a female narrative.

28
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,680
The girl has a beautiful voice.

29
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,080
When matched with the guy's singing voice,

30
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
it's heavenly.

31
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,760
"Destined"?

32
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,200
What? You don't believe in that?

33
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,020
Everything happens for a reason.

34
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,400
Causes determine results.

35
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,880
Choices lead to the situation we face.

36
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,010
I don't believe in destiny.

37
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,120
But many things...

38
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,450
-are inexplicable.
-That's impossible.

39
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,440
So you showing up here now,

40
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,680
-does that need explanation too?
-Of course.

41
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,080
There are many shops around.

42

Yet you show up in front of mine.

43
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,880
Isn't that destiny?

44
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,040
There are five record shops...

45
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,760
on my way home from the company.

46
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,000
And I only feel like buying...

47
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440
or listening to a record...

48
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,080
once every two months on average.

49
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,120
So, there's a 20% chance...

50
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,440
I'd visit this shop once...

51
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,840
every two months.

52
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,600
In two years,

53
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,480
there'd be 94% chance...

54
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,120
for me to come to the shop.

55
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,480
Nothing special, got it?

56
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,560
No.

57
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,360
And it's no fun.

58
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
But I think...

59
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,920
it's due to destiny...

60
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,450
that you'd show up here now.

61
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,200

make me believe in destiny?

63

When you're not happy,

64

and know that everything's destined.

65
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,260
You'd feel less upset.

66
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,400
But when you know that
something good's going to happen,

67
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,880
you'd feel happy.

Let's count the passers-by.

If a couple passes by...

71

before we could count to ten,

72
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,120

174
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,840
-[You!]
-[Daddy.]

175
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,180
[The egg cracked.]

176
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,040
[The little goose's dead.]

177
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,120
[It's your fault.]

178
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
[It's yours.]

179
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,160
[Yours.]

180
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,760
-[It was you.]
-[You!]

181
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,720
[Enough, guys.]

182
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,760
[I'll get you another goose.]

183
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,010
[The both of you...]

184
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,440
[have to enjoy blessings...]

185
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,800
[and endure misfortune together.]

186
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,380
[Never fight again,]

187
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,960
-[okay?]
-[Okay.]

188
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,480
[Come on, shake hands.]

189
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,760
[See what I have got you.]

190
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,360
[Little geese.]

191
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,280
-[Do you like them?]
-[Yeah.]

192
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,080
[Thanks, Daddy.]

193
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,320
[Be careful, don't break them.]

194
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,040
[They won't break.
They'll always be with you.]

195
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,240
[They'll always be by my side...]

196
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,920
[like Daddy and Brother?]

197
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,170
[Daddy and Brother...]

198
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,000
[will always be with you.]

199
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Don't worry, Wei Lin has talked to them.

200
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,530
The dubbing director
will introduce us to the producer.

201
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,560
Show them what you've got.
That's how you can get close to Shi Yi.

202
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,440
But Yao Yao,

203
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,080
I'm worried I'd screw up like last time.

204
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,480
But I don't have to be!

205
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,800
Ni Na's not here this time.

206
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,760
Just do your best.

207
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,800
But I'm still worried.

208
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,320
It's fine, babe.

209
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,120
I'm here to protect you.

210
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Oh my God, Yao Yao.

211
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,360
I knew you're the best.

212
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,520
Knock it off, drama queen.

213
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,220
I can't get rid of my nervousness.

214
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,540
Drama Queen Yan...

215
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,480
needs to go to the bathroom.

216
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,040
-I'll wait here. Hurry up.
-Wait for me.

217
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,840
Speaking of first love,

218
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,400
mine...

219
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,360
is unforgettable.

220
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,120
-Tell us.
-Tell us.

221
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,000
Since all of you are interested,

222
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,570
I'll share it with you guys.

223
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,440
My first love and I...

224
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,400
had exactly the same story...

225
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,010
-Hao Ying Jun?
-as "The Tale of Water Utopia".

226
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,880
Does that mean you dumped her?

227
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Yes, I dumped her.

228
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,200
Back then,

229
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,080
I no longer had feelings for her.

230
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,280
But as a man,

231
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
I couldn't waste her time.

232
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,890
I had to be responsible.

233
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,960
That was why I told her...

234
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,320
that it's not working,

235
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,480
and that we should break up.
Then, I turned around charmingly,

236
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,760
and left her.

237
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,720
Did she just let you go?

238
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,000
Aren't you...

239
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,880
asking a stupid question?

240
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,360
I'm such a...

241
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
fine gentleman.

242
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,000
Of course, women would be pestering me.

243
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
She tried everything,

244
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,400
and had made a terrible scene.

245
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,980
But it was useless.

246
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,160
I told her...

247
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,130
that it's over between us.

248
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,520
The fire won't burn forever.

249
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,450
As expected from Mr Hao.

250
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
A whole different love experience.

251
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Mr Hao, I'm really curious.

252
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,280
Why wouldn't you change your mind?

253
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,480
Let me tell you.

254
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,520
To achieve success,

255
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,330
a man mustn't be soft-hearted.

256
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,280
We can't...

257
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,280
be hesitant.

258
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,000
That's how I, Mr Hao...

259
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,240
become a true man.

260
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,720
-I'll talk to you...
-Brother Ying Jun.

261
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,080
Long time no see.

262
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,720
You've lost weight.

263
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,320
Oh, no. Sit tight.

264
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,520
I need to take a good look at you.

265
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,970
Brother Ying Jun,

266
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,920
do you know...

267
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,600
that after such a long time,

268
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,040
I'm still not over you?

269
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
I missed you so much.

270
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,880
Let's talk outside without the others.

271
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,080
You're shy?

272
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,640
Don't be.

273
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,810
Come on, I can still remember...

274
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,280
your look
when you were begging me to stay.

275
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,840
You said...

276
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,400
you were too sad...

277
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,080
to breathe under the same sky.

278
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,640
So you chose to go overseas,

279
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,520
away from this land of distress.

280
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,680
It's mealtime...

281
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,360
By the way, when did you return?

282
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,960
I thought you'd never come back.

283
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,800
What's going on?

284
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,000
I have no idea.

285
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,720
Oops.

286
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,900
I forgot to introduce myself.

287
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,480
I'm Zuo Yao.

288
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,370
The first love your boss mentioned.

289
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,600
-Hi.
-Hi.

290
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,880
You enjoy yourselves here.

291
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Let's go over there.

292
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,240
Please.

293
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,360
-See you later.
-This way, please.

294
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,870
What's going on?

295
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,630
What's wrong with you?

296
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,800
You haven't changed a bit.

297
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,440
How could you say that about me...

298
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
-to my subordinates?
-Hao Ying Jun.

299
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
You're still...

300
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
so shameless after all these years.

301
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,720
Think properly.

302
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,560
Who dumped whom back then?

303
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,480
-Let bygones be bygones.
-Answer me.

304
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,040
-You dumped me.
-Yeah.

305
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
That's right. I dumped you.

306
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,680
Keep that in mind.

307
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Zuo Yao, just you wait.

308
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,280
I'll make you beg.

309
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,280
-You don't look good.
-Do I?

310
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,690
It's nothing. I ran into Hao Ying Jun.

311
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,830
Let's go.

312
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,930
Wei Lin has given me a heads-up.

313
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,520
When the producer's here,

314
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,480
do your best.

315
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,560
May I ask about him?

316
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,440
Is he nice?

317
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,260
Well, the producer...

318
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,190
He takes your manners...

319
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,000
quite seriously, got it?

320
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,960
Understood.

321
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,640
Okay, So...

322
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,560
I'll be leaving...

323
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
-you here.
-Okay.

324
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,960
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

325
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,080
What did he mean...

326
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,600
by "manners"? What's that?

327
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,530
Don't mind that.

328
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,600
Just do your best.

329
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,060
-Don't be nervous.
-Okay.

330
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,040
Mr Hao, you're here.
They're waiting inside there.

331
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,760
-Leave them to me.
-Okay.

332
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,840
Forget it. I have things to attend to.

333
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,440
Mr Hao, you're already here.

334
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,840
Five minutes, maybe?

335
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,800
I need to leave now.

336
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,960
Every second count.

337
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,440
Let alone for five minutes. Move.

338
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,270
Hao Ying Jun.

339
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,970
Mr Shi.

340
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,480
Did you get Yin Jiang?

341
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,520
I'm getting her location. Don't worry.

342
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,800
I'll take care of it today.

343
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,260
-Make it quick.
-Yes, sir.

344
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,970
What are you two doing here?

345
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,400
A voice actor agency...

346
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
wants to audition for Lake God.

347
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
They failed the first round.

348
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,860
But you call them here now?

349
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,000
They weren't feeling well last time.

350
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,960
Mr Shi, they...

351
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,000
are actually good.

352
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,400
Yet they failed the first round.

353
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,590
Don't find excuses.

354
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,920
Tell them to leave. Come on.

355
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,080
You're really...

356
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,540
Settle it yourselves.

357
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,880
-Mr Hao.
-I've received a task.

358
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,720
I'm very busy.

359
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm busy.

360
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,160
I must meet Yin Jiang.

361
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,360
-Time's running out.
-Five minutes will do.

362
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,520
I'm mad now. Try to stop me again.

363
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,960
-I'm mad.
-Mr Hao.

364
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,840
-Hey.
-Mr Shi.

365
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,960
You may leave. I'll handle their audition.

366
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,800
Okay.

367
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,400
[Meeting Room]

368
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,760
It's you ?

369
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,680
You came to the record shop yesterday.

370
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,740
-Your...
-Tell me.

371
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,250
Why do you want the role?

372
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,080
Well, I like the role very much.

373
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,600
As I see myself...

374
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,320
in the character.

375
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,400
And I didn't do well...

376
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,680
in the last audition.

377
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,080
I hope to be given another chance.

378
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,280
I'll fight for it.

379
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,920
Do you know Fang Yan?

380
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,130
Thank goodness.

381
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,120
It's easy then.

382
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,790
Don't worry. I have...

383
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,210
had your part prepared.

384
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,640
The dubbing director told us this.

385
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,100
We'll keep our mouth shut.

386
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,560
Looks like you're really eager
to get the role.

387
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,040
Yes, I think that Lake God...

388
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,640
is a very challenging role.

389
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,440
-And I...
-And to be able to work with Shi Yi...

390
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,640
makes us excited.

391
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,360
This isn't a fan meeting.

392
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,640
Or a place where you come to have fun.
Do you hear me?

393
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,080
What's wrong about fans?

394
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,120
A fan can also
be a professional voice actor.

395
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,720
Does a professional voice actor
need to bribe?

396
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,320
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

397
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,840
I might have gotten the wrong idea.

398
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,040
She didn't know about that.

399
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,120
It's true.

400
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,730
She came
because she likes the role very much.

401
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,560
Please give me another chance.

402
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,790
Listen to my dub.

403
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
If I don't meet your expectation,

404
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,320
I'll give up.

405
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,520
Cut it out. I'll never...

406
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,730
collaborate with people like you.

407
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,400
Fine!

408
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,680
You were prejudiced since the beginning.

409
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,410
I don't think
you'd be able to produce a good film.

410
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,880
Do you want to ask about the goose?

411
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,120
I wanted to give it back.

412
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,760
But now... Little goose,

413
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,240
will you go home with him?

414
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,680
No.

415
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,880
If I were able to move,

416
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,440
I'd never want to face such a...

417
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,840
cold-hearted and stubborn devil.

418
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,920
He's such an eyesore.
An eyesore?

419
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,120
That was what I thought.

420
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,840
You're not going home? So you're mine now.

421
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,040
He's an eyesore...

422
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,080
to me too.

423
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

424
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,680
Seriously? Seriously?

425
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
How could he be...

426
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,160
so stubborn and narrow-minded?

427
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,890
"Does a professional
voice actor need to bribe?"

428
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,040
Yes, we shouldn't...

429
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,240
have bribed.

430
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,680
But that was all because...

431
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,340
of a greedy producer like you.

432
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,200
And "Is this a fan meeting?"

433
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,560
"Is this a place for you to have fun?"

434
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,400
"I'll never collaborate
with people like you."

435
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,360
Come on. So what if I'm a fan?

436
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,600
What did the fans do?

437
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,800
They didn't do anything wrong.

438
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,840
How could he be so prejudiced?

439
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,920
And I like Shi Yi's songs.

440
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,560
Is it wrong to like him?

441
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,000
I got it.

442
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,850
Maybe the money wasn't enough?

443
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,280
This could be.

444
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,480
Tell me. Why?

445
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,560
I swear with my life.

446
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,440
I never meant...

447
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,440
to make any money from this.

448
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,040
The dubbing director got me wrong.

449
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,300
I'm telling the truth.

450
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,300
As usual. Fire him.

451
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,080
By the way, I have found Yin Jiang,

452
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,710
and got her address.

453
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,930
I'll meet her later.

454
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,160
So, I'll get back to work.

455
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
-Wait.
-I swear...

456
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,700
Do you think...

457
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,760
I'm annoying?

458
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,410
Or my appearance is an eyesore?

459
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,560
I think...I hit my ears.

460
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,160
Now I have AOM. I can't hear anything.

461
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
-Get lost.
-Sure.

462
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
What, now?

463
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,840
Tell me.

464
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,720
[Zuo Yao, I got the news that...]

465
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,840
[Shi Yi's leaving for America next week.]

466
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,500
[You'll need to act quickly.]

467
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,400
Oh my, we have too little time.

468
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,360
Okay, got it.

469
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,080
♫ Give me a glass of
water to forget love. ♫

470
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,600
♫ So that I don't have to cry anymore. ♫

471
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,560
No crying.

472
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,240
Little goose,

473
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,520
immerse yourself in
this love-forgetting water.

474
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,400
Forget that bad guy.

475
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,240
Don't be heartbroken for him.

476
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,970
You have many other friends...

477
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,400
around you.

478
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,400
-Hi.
-Hi.

479
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Can you get serious?

480
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,240
I thought it was me and Wei Lin
who are sick now.

481
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,640
You seem too relaxed.

482
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,920
Says who.

483
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,160
I can prove I'm not.

484
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,200
Look.

485
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,540
Shi Yi's schedule.

486
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,330
But it's not much of a schedule.

487
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,520
He's inactive.

488
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,200
Why do you think...

489
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,320
Shi Yi is called Fairy?

490
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,040
Isn't that because he looks good?

491
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,210
No.

492
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,880
How ignorant.

493
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,020
And you call yourself his fan?

494
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,040
He's like a fairy...

495
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,840
because he isolates himself...

496
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,440
to practise...

497
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,960
and make music every day.

498
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,800
Isolate himself...

499
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,720
everyday?

500
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,640
What about me?

501
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,650
Yeah, I have to do something quick,

502
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,960
so that you and Shi Yi...

503
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,160
can meet face to face .

504
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,640
♫ Give me a glass of
water to forget love. ♫

505
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,600
♫ So that I don't have to cry anymore. ♫

506
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,080
Is this the place?

507
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,960
Seems shabby.

508
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,530
Did I get the wrong address?

509
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,890

-You...
-I... I can't get this done.

518
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,360
So, you're the executive producer?

519
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,560
And you?

520
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,960
He's the president of Concept Pictures,
Mr Shi.

521
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,770
The chief producer of
"The Tale of Water Utopia".

523
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,200
What a narrow-minded...

524
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,840

525
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,960
How unexpected.

526

-Sign the contract.
-Why?

527
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,280
I did statistical research.

528
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,290
Do you know how many small dubbing
workshops are there in the industry?

529
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,480
At least 80%.

530
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,960
So, you're not capable of any competition.

531
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,240
And most of them close down...

532
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,200
within five years.

533
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,430
This should be...

534
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,850
your third year, right?

535
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,040
Thanks for your concern, Mr Hao.

536
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,080
But we...

537
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,400
can take care of ourselves.
Leave us alone.

00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,920
For a voice actor,

539
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,480
joining a production team...

540
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,340
and meeting with other actors...

541
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,590
is the way to learn...

542
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,480
different styles of performance.

543
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,160
One can never grow like this...

544
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,280
if she works alone at home.

545
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,920
In this industry,
Concept Pictures is a platform...

546

that can give you the best resources.

547
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,640
And I believe Yin Jiang's voice...

548
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,240
deserves more recognition.

-You still think I'm a brainless fangirl?

551

Mr Shi, a fangirl like me...

552
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,960
is not worth...

553

your effort.

I'm a brainless fangirl to him.

I won't work with him.

Fine. On one condition.
