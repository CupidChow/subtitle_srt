that pathetic love history of mine, right?

337
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,960
Gu Wei used me...

338
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,560
as her stepping stone to get to you.

339
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,960
I'm just a back-up to her.

340
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,440
She wasted the best time of my life.

341
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,000
If I didn't meet Zuo Yao...

342
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,280
I might not be able to walk out
of that pathetic relationship.

343
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,210
-I can't do it now.
-That's enough.

344
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,280
If you can't manage Gu Wei,

345
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,680
at least make sure
she stays away from Fang Yan.

346
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,610
That I can do.

347
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,320
Since Fang Yan has finished
dubbing her character.

348
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,450
I'll ask her not to come to the company.

349
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,280

350
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,000
Are you going to miss her?

351
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,300
Just do what you have to do.

352
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,120
Just admit that you miss her.

353
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,880
You're such a coward.

You guys stay put. Don't go out.

373

That's because
Shi Yi's fans have gone berserk.

374
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,560
They'll do anything.

375
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,000
They might hurt Fang Yan
when they see her.

376
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,040
Right.

377

[I'm sorry that I dragged you

[The Tale of Water Utopia]

408
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,440
This is a serious situation.

409
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,240
Do any of you have any solutions?

410
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,310
Actually, we've only two options.

411
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,360
We either announce to the public
that they both are dating,

412
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,640
or...

413
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,040
we refute the rumours.

414
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,680
What's the best solution that
you have, Shi Yi?

415
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,720
Of course, we'd go for
the option of refuting the rumours.

416
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,920
Shi Yi is an idol.

417
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,160
He'll lose lots of his fans if we announce
to the public that they both are in love.

418
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,920
But once we announce that the lead actor
of The Tale of Water Utopia...

419
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,880
and the voice artist who dubs
the character Lake God are in love,

420
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,560
it'll definitely help with
the promotion of the film.

421
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,080
We can't let this opportunity...

422
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,280
to slip away right in front of us.

423
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,240
No. Shi Yi still has a few
endorsement contracts.

424
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
He can't get involved in any promotions
that involve a romantic relationship.

425
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,500
But this is the perfect chance
to promote this film.

426
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,420
No way.

427
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,320
We can't let this go.

428
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
Hold on.

429
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Why don't we listen to
what Mr Shi Yi has to say?

430
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,770
Let's announce our relationship.

431
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,480
Brother Shi Yi,
you're not dating Fang Yan.

432
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,320
Once you started this lie,
you'll have to keep lying.

433
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,280
This is not the best solution.

434
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,600
Besides that, Fang Yan...

435
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,400
has never faced the public before.

436
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,000
How can she handle the stress
brought by the media?

437
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,320
Apart from that,
she's one of our employees.

438
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,560
Who should bear the responsibilities...

439
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,640
if this brings negative impact
on our company?

440
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,040
Fang Yan is not a celebrity.

441
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,640
She doesn't have any fans to protect her.

442
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,040
And now the photo is out.

443
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,640
If we don't make a public announcement,

444
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
the media might accuse her
to be a mistress.

445
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
Or...

446
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,160
she might be accused as a flirtatious
woman who'd do anything to be famous.

447
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,820
There might be other
nonsensical accusations.

Based on the hot search right now,

453
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,320
isn't this the perfect chance to promote
The Tale of Water Utopia?

454
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,480
Once the scandal is out,

455
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,120
The Tale of Water Utopia will be...

456
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,680
the top the hot searches.

457

The effect of this kind of subjects...

458
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,360
can be seen immediately.

459
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,240
Making the public announcement...

460
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,640
is the best option for Concept Pictures...

461
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,400
and you.

462
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,480
If we make you two a couple now,

463
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,400
your image will be destroyed...

464
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,120
when you two break up later.

465
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,040
It's obvious that making
the public announcement...

466
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,960
will do...

467

470
