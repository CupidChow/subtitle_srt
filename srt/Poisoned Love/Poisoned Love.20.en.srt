[Episode 20]

4
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
Shi Meng.

5
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,160
What happened to her?

6
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Fang Yan.

7
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,759
She had a relapse.

8
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,480
It was my fault. When I got here...

9
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,280
Never mind.

10
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,620
Hurry up and treat her.

11
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
Me?

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,480
Can't you just kiss her?

13
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,160
Hold her first. I'll explain to you later.

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,320
Come.

15
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Fang Yan!

16
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,680
How did she pass out?

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,180
She didn't pass out. She fell asleep.

18
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
She'll wake up in a while.

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400
Fell asleep?

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,640
Take a look at this.

21
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,560
This is...

22
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,360
That day,

23
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
after you held Fang Yan,

24
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,640
she got better.

25
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
She thought it was me who held her...

26
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,680
and asked me to treat her.

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
So,

28
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,580
the person
who can actually cure Fang Yan...

29
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,640
isn't me.

30
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
But you.

31
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,600
Only I can cure her.

32
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,360
Then, at the restaurant...

33
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,040
I lied to you.

34
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,920
I stole Dr Cui's notes...

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,000
on how to put Fang Yan into hypnosis.

36
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,250
Fang Yan didn't actually
have a relapse that day.

37
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,320
I see.

38
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,440
So that's what happened.

39
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
You're awake.

40
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
Why are you here?

41
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,040
Where's Shi Yi?

42
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
Is Shi Yi alright? Where is Shi Yi?

43
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,960
He's fine.

44
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,720
Then, where did Shi Yi...

45
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,600
Where did he go?

46
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,040
I won't let you leave me again.

47
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,400
When did I ever leave you?

48
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,680
What are you doing?

49
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,440
Who's there?

50
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,800
Hold on a second.

51
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
I'm coming. I'm coming.

52
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,840
Zuo Yao,

53
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,200
it's been a while.

54
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
Why are you here?

55
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,760
What brings you here?

56
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,860
We're old friends after all.
We should catch up.

57
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,960
What's the matter?

58
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,560
Am I not welcomed here?

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,320
I like what you've done with your house.

60
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,890
Just get straight to the point.

61
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
After all these years,

62
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,960
you're still as blunt as ever.

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,920
Fine.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,460
Then I'll cut to the chase.

65
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,960
I'll be frank with you.

66
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
I came here today...

67
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,120
so that you'd ask Fang Yan...

68
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,160
to stay away from Shi Meng.

69
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,240
Gu Wei.

70
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,480
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

71
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,280
Fang Yan is an adult.

72
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
I can't control her.

73
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,080
Besides,

74
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,840
who she likes or wants to date...

75
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,480
is her freedom.

76
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,720
Fine.

77
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,480
Since you can't control her,

78
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,130
then I can't guarantee her safety.

79
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,760
Because I knew...

80
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,720
what Ni Na did last time.

81
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,960
Ni Na?

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,360
So last time, it was...

83
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,480
Gu Wei, I'm warning you.

84
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Leave Fang Yan alone.

85
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,480
Sure, no problem.

86
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
But there's just one thing.

87
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,840
Tell her to stay away from Shi Meng.

88
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,720
Why didn't you lock the door?
Yao Yao, I'm coming in.

89
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,360
-I'm going out again.
-Stop right there.

90
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,890
How did she know I live here?

91
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,120
I have no idea.

92
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,159
It wasn't me. I honestly have no idea.

93
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,400
Why are you here?

94
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,720
So it has nothing to do with you?

95
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,480
-Nope.
-I take that as a "yes".

96
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,240
Zuo Yao, why won't you believe me?

97
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
Why?

98
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,200
Ms Gu.

99
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,810
Done with your inspection?

100
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,640
My small house doesn't have a room...

101
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,280
for an honourable guest like you.

102
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
Hao Ying Jun,

103
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,280
your son is so big already?

104
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,960
-He...
-He's my son.

105
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,480
Isn't your son Hao Ying Jun's son?

106
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,290
I'm too lazy to explain to you.
Just leave.

107
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,160
So this is not your son?

108
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,240
No wonder he's so good-looking.
He doesn't take after you at all.

109
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,080
Now wait a minute...

110
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,200
That's not right.

111
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,920
Both the timing and age match.

112
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,800
That time, both of you were together.

113
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,960
Could it be that... you cheated on him?

114
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,640
I cheated on him?

115
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,799
Speak for yourself.

116
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,919
Back then both of you had an affair.

117
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,760
Now you're trying to put the blame on me.

118
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,920
I've never seen...

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,960
such a ridiculous thing in all my life.

120
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,080
Me and him?

121
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Come now, Yao Yao.

122
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
What did you mean by that?

123
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,720
Do you really think there was something
between Gu Wei and me?

124
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,400
I've told you so,

125
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,160
so, so many times.

126
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
You're right.

127
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,840
I used to like Gu Wei back then,

128
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,760
-but it was over a decade ago.
-Go on.

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,520
-Keep lying.
-Zuo Yao.

130
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
You'd better set the record straight.

131
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,280
This is not something...

132
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
that Shi Meng should know.

133
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,040
Should I give you a hint?

134
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,640
On our graduation day...

135
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,640
You know very well
what both of you have done.

136
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
On our graduation day,

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
I was overjoyed. Then I...

138
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,320
I was wasted.

139
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,200
I blacked out.
I don't even remember how I got home.

140
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,160
Then you dumped me all of a sudden.

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,160
You don't have to explain.

142
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,480
I had seen everything that day.

143
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,520
Zuo Yao, don't get worked up.

144
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,960
Listen to me. You've misunderstood.

145
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,320
You don't have to explain.
I know what I saw.

146
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,520
On our graduation day,

147
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,160
Hao Ying Jun was drunk,
so I took him home.

148
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,370
As soon as we got inside his house,
he threw up all over me.

149
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, come on.

150
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,800
Zuo Yao...

151
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,920
It was really dirty,
so I took off my shirt,

152
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,720
went inside and cleaned myself.

153
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,960
Hao Ying Jun.

154
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,200
Hao Ying Jun,

155
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm leaving.

156
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,720
He was flat out drunk.

157
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,460
What could happen between us?

158
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,880
You tell me.

159
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,720
Nothing could have happened. Really.

160
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,120
Absolutely nothing.

161
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,000
Zuo Yao, you know it full well.

162
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,800
For over a decade,
Shi Meng has always been...

163
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,160
the guy I love.

164
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,880
Hao Ying Jun and I got together...

165
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,760
to make Shi Meng jealous.

166
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,580
Do you think Hao Ying Jun is...

167
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,200
Only you would see something in him.
Not me.

168
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,560
No.

169
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,760
Wait a second.

170
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,120
Yao Yao, did you break up with me
because of this?

171
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,480
Please let me explain.

172
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,520
If I had explained back then,

173
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
we wouldn't have wasted so many years
without each other.

174
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
And you wouldn't...

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,680
have been with another man.

176
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,920
Another man?

177
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Ever since I broke up with you,

178
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,600
I've been single. There's no other man.

179
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,320
Then who is Zuo You's father?

180
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,640
I don't want to talk about it.

181
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,480
Was it a surrogacy?

182
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,480
Even if it was a surrogacy,

183
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,960
the child should have a father.

184
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,400
He couldn't have been born from a rock.

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,560
I told you, Zuo You is my son.

186
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,320
Stop asking already.

187
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,280
Zuo... Zuo You.

188
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,680
When... When did you come back?

189
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,920
Don't argue any more.

190
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,040
I knew it.

191
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,480
I was adopted.

192
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,400
You...

193
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,760
How did you know? Who told you this?

194
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,760
So I really was adopted.

195
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,080
No.

196
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,760
How is that possible?

197
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
Listen to me.

198
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,520
What's there to explain?

199
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,460
You're not my biological mother.

200
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,840
He's not my biological father.

201
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,240
No. Listen to me, alright?

202
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,680
I've grown up.

203
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,000
I've always suspected it.

204
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,720
Blood relation is just
a biological concept.

205
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Whether or not we're related by blood,

206
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Mum,

207
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,720
you are my one and only mother.

208
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,440
Okay, I'll do my homework now.

209
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
If I finish it now,

210
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,820
I might be able to catch
the science story broadcast later.

211
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,400
That boy...

212
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,520
is something else.

213
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,250
He will achieve great things
when he grows up.

214
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,920
-Zuo Yao.
-Are you done yet?

215
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,840
Just leave if you're done.

216
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,520
Zuo Yao, I... I don't know...

217
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,160
You, too! Get out of here!

218
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,120
-Zuo Yao.
-Leave!

219
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,240
Shi Meng, can you pinch me?

220
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,640
Why would I?

221
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,600
Because none of this feels real.

222
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,840
I think I am dreaming.

223
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,680
Silly.

224
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,600
So you despise me.

225
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm just kidding.

226
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,440
Last time, you left me...

227
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,280
to let Shi Yi treat me.

228
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,000
But how did you find out about the truth
this time?

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,920
Shi Yi told you, didn't he?

230
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,800
Then how did Shi Yi find out about this?

231
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,120
Is it because...

232
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,680
I like you better when you're silly.

233
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,520
Shi Yi, where are you going?

234
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,720
I'm going home.

235
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,680
Going home?

236
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,640
Why?

237
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,600
We wanted to buy you a meal.

238
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,400
Buy me a meal?

239
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,760
After such a big fiasco...

240
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,280
and all your help,

241
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,560
I should take you out...

242
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,240
to dinner as a token of appreciation.

243
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,720
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

244
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll go get changed.

245
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,120
Why didn't you tell her?

246
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,440
What should I tell her?

247
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,450
That I've lied to you...

248
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,520
and to her.

249
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,840
I knew it was a mistake
since the beginning,

250
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,960
but I kept it from both of you.

251
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,080
I even...

252
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,120
I even hypnotised her...

253
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,800
and lied to you.

254
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,920
That's between you and her.

255
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,640
Besides, if anyone were
to tell her the truth,

256
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,440
it shouldn't be me.

257
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,360
Looks like you don't have...

258
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,480
the heart to apologise to her either.

259
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,080
Are you going to run from it?

260
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,160
What?

261
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,360
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

262
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,240
-Let's go to Zuo Yao's place.
-What's the matter?

263
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Zuo You is missing. He ran away.

264
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,680
Calm down, Yao Yao.

265
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,960
Hurry up!

266
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,320
-Did you find him?
-No. We've searched everywhere.

267
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,440
-Is he there?
-What should I do?

268
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,280
-Is he there?
-No, no!

269
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,400
-Yao Yao, calm down.
-Yao Yao, what happened?

270
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,800
-How is Zuo You?
-Fang Yan.

271
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,320
Zuo You found out he was adopted,

272
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,040
so he left a letter and ran away.

273
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,480
It was my fault.
I didn't watch him properly.

274
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,940
Calm down.
Did Zuo You say where he was going?

275
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,920
-What did he write?
-Nothing much...

276
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,520
except he couldn't handle the truth
and he wanted to take a walk.

277
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,600
What if he's kidnapped?

278
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,000
-Impossible.
-That's impossible.

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,120
Just calm down.

280
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,960
Think about where he might go.

281
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,720
A kid should not be able to go too far.

282
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,040
-Yes, Yao Yao. Think about it.
-Yes, think carefully.

283
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,480
Think about where he usually goes,

284
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,760
the kids he usually hangs out with...

285
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,599
-or his favourite food.
-His favourite food.

286
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,560
What's his favourite food?
His favourite food...

287
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,079
Coca-cola fried chicken. Fried chicken!

288
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,440
-Fried chicken.
-Whenever he's sad,

289
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,839
-he'd eat fried chicken.
-Fast food.

290
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,800
-Fast food restaurant.
-Yes.

291
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,440
Nearby fast food places...

292
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,000
These are all the fried chicken
places in the area.

293
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,880
-Let's split up.
-The three of us will search south.

294
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,400
-You search north, okay?
-Okay.

295
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,200
-I'll go with you.
-You'd better don't go.

296
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,400
Someone might recognise you.

297
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,359
We need someone to stay back
in case he comes home.

298
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,240
-You're right.
-Let's go.

299
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,359
Thank you.

300
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,040
-We'll leave it to you, Shi Yi.
-Thank you.

301
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,320
Let's go.

302
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,440
-Zuo You!
-Zuo You!

303
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,640
Zuo You!

304
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,640
Zuo You!

305
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,960
-Zuo You!
-Zuo You!

306
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,320
You You!

307
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,200
Wei Lin,

308
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,740
-look over there. We'll go there.
-Alright.

309
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,960
-Zuo You!
-Zuo You!

310
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,880
Zuo You!

311
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,170
-Hello.
-Hello.

312
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,640
Have you seen a boy about this tall?

313
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,960
-He's missing.
-No.

314
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,920
-Okay, thanks.
-Sorry.

315
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,080
Thank you.

316
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,120
-Come, let's go over there.
-Let's go.

317
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,800
[Mum,]

318
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,560
[this is the biggest thing
that's happened...]

319
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,760
[in the seven years
and nine months of my life.]

320
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,020
[It turns out that I was really adopted.]

321
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,040
[I thought I could take it,]

322
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,200
[but I realised the world of adults
isn't that simple.]

323
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,720
[I need to go somewhere
to gather my thoughts.]

324
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,600
[Don't miss me.]

325
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,960
[Yours truly, Zuo You.]

326
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,640
Zuo You?

327
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,080
Zuo You, are you here?

328
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,960
Zuo You.

329
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,840
Do you know...

330
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,480
how I knew you'd be in Fang Yan's room?

331
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,800
Let me tell you a secret.

332
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,560
When I was ten years old,

333
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,720
I also ran away from home.

334
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,520
Just like you,

335
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,240
I left a letter.

336
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,160
But after I left home,

337
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,640
I was scared.

338
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,740
I was afraid I would never see them again.

339
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,960
I was afraid they wouldn't want me back.

340
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,120
So I found the perfect place.

341
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,800
I hid under Shi Meng's bed.

342
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
Do something.

343
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,960
What did you do to the kid?

344
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,120
Me? He left without saying a word.

345
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,120
-How would I know?
-Enough.

346
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,160
Let's go and find him.

347
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,160
Come on.

348
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,440
Those few hours I spent under the bed...

349
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,200
were the best memories of my childhood.

350
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,600
Because I saw
how anxious they were for me.

351
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,360
I also knew...

352
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
that I was irreplaceable after all.

353
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,160
Zuo You,

354
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,600
do you feel the same way I did?

355
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,760
So...

356
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,800
why did you run away from home?

357
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Zuo You,

358
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,880
who taught you to run away?

359
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,800
Do you know how worried your mum was?

360
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,400
She looked everywhere for you.

361
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,260
Her eyes are swollen from crying.

362
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,880
Mum, I'm sorry.

363
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,200
Well,

364
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,320
now that we've found him,
everything's fine.

365
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,400
Right?

366
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,000
Safety first.

367
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,120
Since we've found Zuo You,

368
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,600
I'll take my leave.

369
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,840
Shi Yi, thank you for your help today.

370
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Thank you.

371
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,080
We're seriously...

372
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,520
grateful to you.

373
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,800
Let me buy you a meal soon.

374
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,910
It's fine.

375
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,640
I just wanted to help the kid.

376
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,640
Shi Yi,

377
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,760
can I talk to you alone?

378
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,080
Why don't you take a walk?

379
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
It's boring staying in here. Right?

380
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,540
Go out and get some air.

381
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,880
Then I'll take him downstairs.

382
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,680
Don't worry. We won't go too far.

383
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,480
Wait a second.

384
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,920
It's cold outside. Put this on.

385
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,240
Go ahead.

386
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,360
Let's go.

387
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,200
Don't be angry.

388
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,640
What matters is we've found him.
We'll talk about it later, okay?

389
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,880
I almost forgot.

390
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,200
I need to talk to someone at the office.

391
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Got to go now. See you.

392
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,520
Do you know why I adopted Zuo You?

393
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,960
No, I don't.

394
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,320
I was pretty pessimistic about love.

395
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,800
After breaking up with you,

396
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,120
I never wanted to date again.

397
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
I just want to be alone.

398
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,360
Later,

399
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,000
because of a coincidence,

400
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
I met Zuo You...

401
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,920
who was abandoned in the hospital.

402
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,760
Actually,

403
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,360
I wanted to send him to a welfare agency.

404
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,520
But when I held him in my arms,

405
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,760
I couldn't let go of him.

406
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,000
At that moment, I thought...

407
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,280
maybe it was God's will.

408
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,600
Maybe the little guy and I are destined
to take care of each other.

409
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
Ever since I adopted Zuo You,

410
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,480
nothing else seems to matter anymore.

411
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,680
He became the driving force in my life,

412
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,720
my everything.

413
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,720
In fact,

414
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,240
I thought of reaching out to you at first.

415
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,120
But I was afraid my worst fears...

416
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,720
would be confirmed.

417
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,080
Well...

418
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,160
I'm very sorry. I’m really sorry

419
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,840
You know...

420
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,160
It's funny.

421
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
I've been shameless all my life.

422
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,880
Do you think I'd falter
when you needed me the most?

423
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,140
I could've explained everything to you.

424
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,890
It wasn't entirely your fault.

425
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,280
I was in the wrong, too.

426
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,640
Back then,

427
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,650
if only I would swallow my pride...

428
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,520
-If only I had asked you...
-Stop it.

429
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,120
Stop it. It's all in the past, alright?

430
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,560
From now on, you can rest easy.

431
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,400
I, Hao Ying Jun,
will always stay by your side.

432
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,480
I won't let you shoulder the burden
all by yourself.

433
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,540
I've got your back.

434
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,840
I'm serious.

435
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,960
Shi Yi,

436
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,840
why do you think...

437
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,160
our parents abandoned us?

438
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,720
I have no idea why they abandoned us.

439
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,120
But I choose to believe...

440
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,660
they had their difficulties.

441
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,880
They had no other choice.

442
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,320
The most important thing is...

443
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,240
we met our mums.

444
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,640
Right?

445
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,000
Will Mum...

446
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,800
abandon me again...

447
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,880
just like my biological mother did?

448
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,010
Do you think your mum loves you?

449
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,000
I don't know.

450
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,920
Silly boy.

451
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,040
If she doesn't love you,

452
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,920
she wouldn't have gone to such lengths
to look for you...

453
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,440
only to abandon you again.

454
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,360
She will love you forever.

455
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,760
Is that true?

456
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,360
Of course it is true.

457
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,120
That's great!

458
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,760
I was afraid I would lose my mum!

459
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,880
I didn't expect
Shi Yi would find Zuo You first.

460
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,360
I was surprised, too.

461
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,280
We should pay more attention
to a child's emotions,

462
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,840
especially at this age.

463
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,880
He must be devastated
upon hearing the truth.

464
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,440
Hopefully the fried chicken we bought...

465
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,440
will solve all his problems.

466
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I think so too.

467
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Hurry up.

468
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Sure.

469
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,680
There there, Zuo You.

470
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,640
Stop crying.

471
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,400
Real men don't cry too much.

472
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,240
Isn't there a song that goes,
"Men, cry your heart out. It's okay?"

473
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,520
Besides, I'm not a grown man yet.

474
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,360
Shi Yi,

475
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,880
how did you find out you were adopted?

476
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,090
One time, when I was little,

477
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
I was looking for my toys at home.

478
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,700
I accidentally found
my adoption certificate.

479
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,880
You must have been very sad
when you saw it.

480
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,080
Sad?

481
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,600
Of course I was sad.

482
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,040
Not only did I feel sad,

483
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,360
I even made...

484
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,640
an irreparable mistake.

485
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,360
Why am I telling you all this?

486
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,040
Zuo You,

487
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,320
you have to remember,

488
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,570
you must never hurt someone who loves you.

489
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,240
Because some mistakes...

490
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,010
can never be amended...

491
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,040
once you've made them.

492
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,560
Shi Yi,

493
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,040
I think I get what you mean.

494
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,280
I'm sorry.

495
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,080
I shouldn't have run away...

496
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,040
and made Mum worry.

497
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,600
Zuo You, you're clever and kind.

498
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,140
Why would anyone hate you?

499
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,600
Shi Yi,

500
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,920
I believe you love your family too.

501
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,480
If you've made any mistakes,

502
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,720
they'll definitely forgive you.

503
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,920
Really?

504
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,120
You should apologise
to the person you love.

505
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,400
Perhaps...

506
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,340
Perhaps she will forgive you.

507
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,080
Shi Yi,

508
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,440
do people know that you're adopted?

509
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,720
This is our little secret.

510
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,460
Come, adopted brother. Give me five.

511
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,800
It's a goose.

512
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,560
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

513
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,500
-Thank you, Dad.
-Thank you, Dad.

514
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,040
So,

515
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,520
is that why...

516
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,800
he abandoned me back then?

517
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,400
Come in.

518
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,760
Sorry for not telling you all this while.

519
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,720
The last time I went
to the orphanage with Shi Yi,

520
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,800
he told me his secret.

521
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
When he was ten,

522
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,640
he found out that he was adopted.

523
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,360
Shi Yi is leaving tomorrow.

524
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,200
The truth is,

525
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,520
at the end of the day,

526
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,080
a family's companionship...

527
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,160
is the most important.

528
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,040
You don't want Shi Yi to leave,

529
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,360
do you?

530
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,960
[These two brothers are really worrisome.]

531
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,280
[I have to figure something out.]

532
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,120
[I believe you love your family too.]

533
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,640
[If you've made any mistakes,]

534
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
[they'll definitely forgive you.]

535
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,840
[You should apologise
to the person you love.]

536
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,000
[Perhaps he's forgiven you.]

537
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,560
Shi Yi.

538
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,240
Shi Yi.

539
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,320
Good morning.

540
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,520
Good morning.

541
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,240
You're...

542
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,680
I'm moving back.

543
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,540
But before I go,

544
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,800
there's something I need to tell you.

545
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,280
Actually,

546
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,240
I knew all along...

547
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,080
that the person who could  cure you...

548
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,040
is Shi Meng.

549
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,140
I never had the guts to tell you...

550
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,600
because I like you.

551
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,440
I wanted to use it as an excuse...

552
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,160
to stay by your side.

553
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,880
Well, I...

554
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,520
-Actually I...
-I know.

555
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,300
You only see me as a friend.

556
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,480
I also know...

557
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,490
that the guy you love
has always been Shi Meng.

558
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,300
I was too selfish.

559
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,800
I caused so much trouble...

560
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,480
in your relationship.

561
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,400
I'm sorry.

562
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,840
It's alright.

563
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,760
Are you forgiving me?

564
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,400
Yes!

565
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,000
Look.

566
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,560
Don't you feel so much better
after telling me?

567
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,920
Actually...

568
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,040
I think you and Shi Meng...

569
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,480
could...

570
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,480
Good morning!

571
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,120
What a coincidence.

572
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,560
Why don't we have breakfast together?

573
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,480
I'll do it.

574
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,360
No need.

575
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,680
I have a meeting. See you.

576
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,960
Surely, you have time for a cup of coffee?

577
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,760
I'll get the door.

578
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,080
Zuo You!

579
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,760
Why are you here? What?

580
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,860
You want to see Shi Yi and Shi Meng?
Come on in.

581
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,800
I've come here...

582
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,800
because I need both your help...

583
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,410
with something important.

584
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,639
This is...

585
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,199
This is Fang Yan's birthday surprise.

586
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,239
So we mustn't let her know.

587
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,639
Listen up.

588
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,320
This is the child of my bird.
It's called My Egg.

589
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,679
My bird got post-partum depression...

590
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,120
and refuses to brood.

591
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,840
And I won't be getting my new incubator
for another three days.

592
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,560
But My Egg is due in a couple of days.

593
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,960
So...

594
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,320
I need a human's warmth
to keep it alive.

595
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,080
After much thinking,

596
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,719
you two are the most
reliable people I know.

597
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,480
Us?

598
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Exactly.

599
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,080
You two must incubate it continuously,
24 hours a day.

600
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,400
My Egg cannot leave a human's warmth
for more than an hour.

601
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,400
But two manly men brooding...

602
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,080
What? You can't even handle
such a simple task?

603
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,880
You call yourselves men?
