That's enough. Stop thinking about it.

I'll always stay by your side.

What did you just say?

13
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,500
I remember something.

[Xiao Liu, you've got to stop now.]

[Yes, it's all my fault.]

[But I did all this because of you.]

The man who kidnapped us
was quarrelling with another man.

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,680
And the other man said,

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,720
"Xiao Liu, send my son back to me."

26

"Give me the ledger."

All right. I think I've figured
everything out, Fang Yan.

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,600
There's...

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,920
There's an emergency that
I've to attend to.

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,050
Can you go home and wait for me, please?

34
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,210
Don't think about it anymore. Go home.

35
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,320
Where are you now?

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,730
I need to see you now.

37
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,820
All right. I'll be there shortly.

38
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,480
Mr Gu,

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,280
the board of directors...

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,720
will attend tomorrow's
board reorganisation meeting.

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,040
I've made some calls.

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,450
Shi Meng has most of the support
from the board of directors.

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,160
But he only focuses on movie production
all this while.

44
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,400
I believe they'll still support you...

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,000
to be the chairman of the company.

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,540
They'd support me back in the days.
But I'm not so sure about it now.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,480
Please arrange a dinner meeting for me.

48
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,600
Yes, Mr Gu.

49
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,440
What's going on?
How come they're not home yet?

50

Shi Meng had to work overtime.

51
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,160
How about Shi Yi?

52

This is weird.

57
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,440
How come Shi Yi disappeared
without telling us?

58
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,080
Right.

59
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,840
Today's meeting is very important
to you, right?

60
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,680
This is the first board meeting after
my father was announced dead.

61
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,080
It's actually a meeting
to fight for power.

62
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,240
-Uncle Gu was the acting chairman.
-Fighting for power?

63
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,440
We're going to decide...

64
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,450
who will be the next chairman.

65
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,090
That's so complicated.

66
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,820
I can't understand a word that
you've just said.

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,480
Let me help you.

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,520
Can you do it?

69
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,480
Of course.
I learnt how to put on a tie before.

70
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,440
Let me try.

71
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,600
Come here.

72
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,560
I didn't understand a word...

73
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,400
that you just told me.

74
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,720
What I know is...

75
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,200
today, your tie...

76
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,640
belongs to me.

77
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,760
It's perfect.

78
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,920
Not bad.

79
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,200
I thought you'd help me
put on a red scarf.

80
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,800
What are you talking about?
I learnt how to do it with all my heart.

81
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,620
It's time for me to leave for the meeting.

82
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,640
All the best in the meeting.

83
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,080
After the meeting,

84
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,880
you'll be the chairman of the company.

85
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,120
You've to bear bigger responsibility
and burden from now on.

86
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,600
You've got to work harder.

87
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,720
Okay?

88
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,640

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,360
Wait for me.

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,840
I've got to go now.

92
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,800
All the best.

93
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,720
Mr Gu,

94
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
this is the first meeting...

95
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,980
after Mr Shi Senior was pronounced dead.

96
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,600
You've been the acting chairman
all this while.

97
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,000
I think you finally can be
the chairman now.

98
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,830
That's not important.

99
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,840
We all are working for this company.

100
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,560
If there's a more suitable candidate,
old people like us...

101
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
have got to let them take the position.

102
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,840
You're generous.

103
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,450
I've confidence in you.

104
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,840
This voting for the next chairman
is just a formality, right?

105
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,370
Your performance is great.

106
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Who else could be the chairman
other than you?

107
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,130
It's almost time for Uncle Gu to retire.

108
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,480
He won't compete with you, right?

109
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,320
But we can't say for sure.

110
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
Uncle Gu...

111
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,960
hasn't been nice to you recently.

112
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,920
Could it be that he's like you...

113
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,580
mixing his personal feelings
into his work?

114
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,159
It's almost time.

115
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,520
Most of the directors are here.

116
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,600
Let's begin.

117
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,560
Hold on.

118
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,570
I'm still waiting for a person.

119
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
Who is he waiting for?

120
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,080
-Is everyone here?
-I don't know.

121
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,010
Who is the person he is waiting for?

122
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
Who else could it be?

123
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,120
-What is he doing here?
-He's waiting for Shi Yi.

124
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,360
What is he doing here?

125
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,320
What is Shi Yi doing here?

126
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,960
Let's welcome the new member of the
board of directors of Concept Pictures.

127
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,240
Mr Shi Yi.

128
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,080
Isn't he just a shareholder?

129
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,690
He never interferes in the business
operations of the company.

130
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
Wei Lin, pass me the mushrooms.

131
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
Wash those potatoes, please.

132
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,280
All right.

133
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Somebody's humming happily.
Someone is in good mood.

134
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,400
Shi Meng will be back later.

135
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,200
He'll be the chairman of Concept Pictures.

136
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,480
Well then someone would be
the wife of the chairman.

137
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,550
Mrs Chairman.

138
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,040
What are you talking about?
We're not even there yet.

139
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,800
You've been dating for so long.
You both are like husband and wife.

140
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,000
And you're telling me you're not
even there yet?

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,160
Where else...

142
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,000
do you want to go?

143
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,400
-What are you talking about?
-What am I talking about?

144
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,200
-She's being shy.
-Here's your drinks.

145
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,920
Do you think we've enough food
for tonight's dinner?

146
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,580
We can always order takeaway
if it's not enough.

147
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,440
-Let Wei Lin have some.
-Why are you still acting like a child?

148
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,040
How many of people will be
having dinner here tonight?

149
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,320
Is Shi Yi coming?

150
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,760
It'll be great if he could join us.

151
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,360
Guys, come and take a look.

152
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,310
The gosling...

153
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,880
The gosling is hatching.

154
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,320
Let's take a look.

155
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,790
See.

156
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,980
This is a good sign.

157
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,000
I think...

158
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,240
there must be some good news today.

159
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,720
Since everyone is here, let's begin.

160
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,240
Mr Shi Senior's share
has been reallocated.

161
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
According to the company by-laws,

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,280
the person with the best performance...

163
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,090
and the most share in hand is...

164
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,880
Shi Meng.

165
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,040
Mr Shi.

166
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,670
If everyone agrees to this,

167
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,020
-then...
-Objection.

168
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,750
I nominate Mr Gu Yuan Zhou...

169
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,040
to be the chairman of Concept Pictures.

170
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,480
Well...

171
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Mr Shi will be following
in his father's footsteps...

172
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,560
if he becomes the chairman of the company.

173
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
Besides that, Mr Shi has led us through...

174
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,830
many obstacles through the years.

175
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,960
I think everyone here can agree that
he's more than capable.

176
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,160
-Right.
-Mr Shi's capability?

177
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,840
Are you talking about the overspend in
The Tale of Water Utopia?

178
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,520
In order to catch up with the deadline,

179
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
we couldn't really follow
the normal procedure...

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,720
when it comes to the budget.

181
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,120
But Mr Gu has acquiesced to it, right?

182
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,520
We do not have to be so strict about...

183
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,080
the issue of the budget of
The Tale of Water Utopia.

184
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,040
As long as we spent the money on
the right place,

185
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,560
we'll be able to earn it back.

186
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,880
Am I right?

187
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,270
Right.

188
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,520
Mr Gu is indeed one of
the most experienced directors here.

189
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,580
He can always look at the big picture.

190
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,880
Let's cut to the chase.

191
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,160
Let's vote.

192
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,560
I vote for Mr Gu.

193
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,640
You...

194
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,720
Well..

195
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
Based on the voting result,

196
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,680
our new chairman is...

197
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,560
Mr Gu Yuan Zhou.

198
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,960
Chairman Gu.

199
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,680
Congratulations.

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,910
Well.

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,520
I hope that Mr Gu will look into
the budget of The Tale of Water Utopia.

202
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,640
Shi Yi,

203
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,120
that's enough.

204
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,800
You know nothing about
the operation of the company.

205
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,280
Now you want to look into the budget.

206
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,920
Who will be responsible if
the progress of the project is delayed?

207
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Are you worried about the progress?

208
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,720
Or are you worried that we might find out
your wrongdoing in the budget?

209
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,800
Well,

210
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,760
we're having this meeting to...

211
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,150
select our new chairman.

212
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,720
We'll discuss about the issue that you
brought up in the coming meeting.

213
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,250
I don't have time to wait for
the next meeting.

214
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,400
Concept Pictures are
our father's life work.

215
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,660
I'll not let anyone...

216
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,680
diminish it.

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,440
[All you have to do is to help me be
the chairman of the company.]

218
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,570
[And you'll be the CEO of the company.]

219
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,600
[I'll figure out a way to get
Shi Meng's share for you.]

220
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,760
[I'm not interested in being the CEO.]

221
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,360
[I only have one condition.]

222
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,780
[Kick Shi Meng out of Concept Pictures.]

223
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,610
[I want him to have a taste of
losing everything.]

224
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,120
Perfect.

225
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,520
Here's your favourite soft drink.

226
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,720
Why are you giving him soft drink again?

227
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,800
Finally he's back.

228
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,280
I'll get the door. Time for dinner.

229
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,880
Should we get the champagne?

230
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,070
Yes.

231
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,720
Help me get it. Quick.

232
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,440
-Is Shi Meng back?
-No.

233
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,520
Where's Shi Meng?

234
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,310
Fang Yan, listen to me.

235
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
You've got to calm down.

236
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,560
Something has happened to...

237
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
Shi Meng.

238
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,840
What happened? Spit it out.

239
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,040
Actually, everything went well
at the beginning.

240
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,680
But the board of directors used
the financial issue...

241
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,480
as an excuse to dismiss Shi Meng.

242
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,320
Not only that he wasn't selected as
the chairman of the company,

243
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
he also lost his title as
the producer of...

244
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,200
The Tale of Water Utopia.

245
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Hold on.

246
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,640
What's going on? Where's Shi Meng?

247
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,600
He disappeared after the meeting.

248
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,920
I looked for him everywhere
in the company.

249
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,160
He's not answering my calls.

250
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,080
So, I thought he might come home.

251
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,080
I...

252
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,840
Hold on.

253
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,200
What exactly happened to Mr Shi?
Could it be that somebody...

254
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
has something on him?

255
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,360
Right.

256
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,680
What are you talking about?

257
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,040
Shi Meng is an honest man.

258
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,400
What are you thinking?

259
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,160
Why did he run away?

260
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,800
He's acting like
he's done something wrong.

261
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,600
What are you talking about?
Who has done something wrong?

262
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,680
Think about it.

263
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,220
He was dismissed as...

264
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,720
the CEO of the company,
as well as the producer of...

265
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,040
The Tale of Water Utopia.

266
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,080
All his hard work all these years
has gone in vain.

267
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,200
It's just like you worked so hard
to raise a child.

268
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,760
After he has grown up,

269
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,280
he found someone else to be his father
and he treated you like his enemy.

270
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,880
If it was you, can you take it?

271
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,480
We should call Shi Yi.

272
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,840
-He might know where Shi Meng is.
-Put down your handphone.

273
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,640
No one should ever contact Shi Yi.

274
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,920
Don't call him.

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,640
Thinking about him makes me angry.

276
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,440
What happened?

277
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,640
What happened?

278
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,290
Do you know why Shi Meng was dismissed?

279
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,140
Shi Yi was the first one
who voted to dismiss him.

280
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,560
That's impossible.

281
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,760
Fang Yan has been trying to help
the both of them...

282
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,440
to mend their relationship these few days.

283
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,480
That's impossible.

284
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
I witnessed the whole thing.
You don't believe in what I say?

285
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,120
[I'm sorry. I need to take
a few days off. Don't worry about me.]

286
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,960
I was upset too.

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,840
Mr Shi was dismissed by his own brother.

288
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,720
It's like Shi Yi stabbed him in his chest.

289
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
Speaking of which,

290
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,560
how come I didn't notice that...

291
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
Shi Yi is actually a bad person
all these years?

292
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,200
-Shi Yi...
-Stop it.

293
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,400
What should we do now?

294
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,840
I've no idea.

295
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,300
Fang Yan, you've got to calm down.

296
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,000
Where's Fang Yan?

297
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,120
I don't know.

298
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Hello, Yao Yao.

299
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,040
Where are you, Fang Yan? Come home now.

300
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,260
I'm not going back.

301
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,440
I'm going to look for Shi Meng.

302
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Taxi.

303
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,800
What did she say?

304
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,980
She said she's going to find Shi Meng.

305
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,400
[Why are we producing movies?]

306
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,120
[Just for the money?]

307
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
[There are many ways to make money.]

308
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,600
[The world of The Tale of Water Utopia
is a magical world.]

309
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
[No matter how magical it is,]

310
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,400
[the message that we're trying to
convey is love.]

311
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
[We need someone to convey
this message to the audience.]

312
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,280
[We need an idealistic fool to do it.]

313
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,120
[Shi Meng,]

314
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,240
[I went to all the places that
we've been to all this while.]

315
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,920
[And I realised that]...

316
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,240
[you've given me so many sweet memories.]

317
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,760
[Where are you?]

318
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Fang Yan.

319
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,000
They told me that...

320
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,250
you're the one who kicked Shi Meng
out of the company.

321
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,480
Is that true?

322
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,160
Yes.

323
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,280
What if I tell you that...

324
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,800
there's a reason behind all this?

325
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Would you believe me?

326
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,040
Does it matter now?

327
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,060
It's cold out here.

328
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,210
Let me send you home.

329
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,360
It's okay.

330
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,160
Shi Meng needs me now.

331
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,320
I must find him.

332
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,400
I must find him.

333
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,120
Fang Yan.

334
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,330
What if I tell you...

335
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,920
I know a way...

336
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,700
to get Shi Meng back?

337
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,130
Are you willing to work with me?

338
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,040
I'm sure Shi Meng will show up...

339
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,400
if we do this.

340
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,560
Trust me.

341
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,240
You don't have to worry about anything.

342
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,320
It's just a play.

343
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,600
I think...

344
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,240
this is the only way to force...

345
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,400
Shi Meng to show up.

346
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,360
Come on.

Shi Yi is getting engaged.

-She's so ugly.

This is great.
It never crossed my mind that...

389
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,000
you and Xiao Fang are...

390
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,240
a couple.

391
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,560

392
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,320
Shi Yi.

393
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,480
Hi, Mr Shi Yi.

394
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,680
Do you have some time now?

395
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,000
Can we interview you for a minute, please?

396
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,800
Sure.

397
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,320
I'll get going now, Director.

398
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,450
-Just make yourself home.
-Go and deal with them.

399
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,080
Shi Yi, we've given you
all of our support.

400
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,960
We brought five channels to do
a live broadcast today.

401
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,200
-What do you think? Not bad, right?
-Brother Shi Yi,

402
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,320
they're broadcasting your engagement.

403
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,960
But we've our headlines ready.

404
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,360
After the ceremony, please give us
an exclusive interview.

405
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,560
What exclusive interview
are you talking about?

406
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,840
We're all in the same industry.
We shouldn't be so calculative.

407
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,560
Let's have a group interview.

408
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,560
I still need your help to
increase the exposure of this ceremony.

409
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,840
Thank you for your help.

410
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,080
You're most welcome.

411
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,760
Right. Where's the bride-to-be?

412
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,160
When can we see her?

413
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,640
-Right. Where's the bride-to-be?
-She'll be here in a minute.

414
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,600
All right. Thank you.

415
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,680
Well, I've to attend to some matters.

416
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,880
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Brother Shi Yi.

417
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,320
Let's go. Let's close up.

418
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,380
I never thought that everything
would go so well today.

419
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,480
It's almost time.
Why isn't Shi Meng here yet?

420
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,600
Is this going to work?

421
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,360
Can you calm yourself down, please?

422
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,000
You've got to be patient.

423
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,590
Do I look all right?

424
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,920
You're so beautiful.
You look like a fairy.

425
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,400
Shi Meng will regret this. Really.

426
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,320
That's right.

427
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,200
Shi Meng is a coward...

428
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,000
if he never shows up...

429
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,640
after everything that we did.

430
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,560
I'll definitely...

431
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,240
block him from my life.

432
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,200
Hold on.

433
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,680
Fang Yan hasn't said anything about this.

434
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,600
What are you whining about?

435
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,800
Besides that,

436
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,210
-do you think Shi Meng cares about you?
-Hao Ying Jun,

437
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,560
-what did you just say?
-I'm sorry.

438
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,600
I'll give you a chance to say it again.

439
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,240
Yao Yao,

440
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,520
I was agitated just now.

441
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,160
Stop scolding Shi Meng.

442
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,120
You've been scolding him for a week now.

443
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,390
I promise...

444
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,910
he'll show up today.

445
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,660
Who cares about your promise.
Stay away from me.

446
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,280
Right.

447
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,320
Shi Meng has been gone for a week now.

448
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,000
Yan Yan,

449
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,880
what if...

450
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,760
What if...

451
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,400
What if...

452
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,600
What if Shi Meng doesn't show up today?

453
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,330
How are we going to end all this?

454
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,720
He'll show up.

455
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,100
Right.

456
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,360
I think so too.

457
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,840
I'm just worried that...

458
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,000
Shi Yi still has feelings for you.

459
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,040
If he wants you
to engage to him for real,

460
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,320
what should we do?

461
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Shi Yi isn't that kind of person.

462
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,880
I trust him.

463
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,600
Xiao Yi.

464
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,160
Uncle Gu.

465
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,320
Xiao Yi,

466
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,560
I was planning to give you
my blessing just now.

467
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,440
But I was stopped by the reporters.

468
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,280
They were very noisy.

469
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,290
Thank you, Uncle Gu.

470
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
I invited all the media and reporters...

471
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,000
to report this ceremony.

472
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,320
I want everyone to witness
my engagement ceremony.

473
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,880
You really love...

474
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,680
Fang Yan, don't you?

475
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,400
But I think...

476
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,240
Shi Meng must be watching this as well.

477
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,840
What if he's here today?

478
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,240
I've hired a professional
security team today.

479
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,480
They'll check the identity of each guest.

480
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,880
He won't be able to get in.

481
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,960
Mr Shi,

482
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,280
what are you doing here?

483
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
Ke Ke.

484
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,040
We miss you so much...

485
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,200
after you left.

486
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,540
Everyone misses the days when we put in
hard work for The Tale of Water Utopia.

487
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,920
Mr Shi,

488
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,320
just let me know...

489
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,360
if you need help.

490
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,640
Let's go.

491
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,760
Hold on.

492
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,180
I do need a favour from you.

493
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,380
Are you going to snatch the bride?

494
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,080
That's so romantic. I'll support you.

495
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,800
From now on,

496
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,760
Mr Shi is my boyfriend.

497
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,320
Give it to me.

498
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,320
Thank you.

499
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,850
What are you doing here?

500
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,120
Everything is ready.

501
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,280
Everyone is waiting for the bride-to-be.

502
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,120
Stop calling me bride-to-be.

503
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,490
You're so beautiful...

504
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
today.

505
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,200
Thank you.

506
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,580
However, this beautiful lady...

507
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,240
is not mine.

508
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,520
What's wrong, Shi Yi?

509
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,320
Fang Yan,

510
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,960
can you do me a favour?

511
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,840
If...

512
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
Shi Meng never shows up till the end,

513
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,760
can you finish this play with me?

514
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,920
It's just a play.

515
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,920
I'd feel embarrassed...

516
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,130
if everyone finds out about it.

517
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,080
Besides that,

518
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,170
I'll be announcing our break-up soon.

519
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I believe that...

520
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,400
Shi Meng will show up.

521
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,320
Good day everyone.

522
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

523
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,920
please be seated.

524
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,720
I'm pleased to...

525
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,680
announced that...

526
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,440
the engagement ceremony of...

527
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,160
Mr Shi Yi and Miss Fang Yan...

528
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,520
begins now.

529
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,720
Let's welcome...

530
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,360
the groom-to-be,

531
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,720
Mr Shi Yi.

532
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,640
I'd like to thank everyone
for coming and...

533
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,170
witness the most important moment
of my life.

534
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Next,

535
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,360
let's welcome my beautiful bride-to-be,

536
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,480
Fang Yan.

537
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,400
From her unsettled eyes,

538
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,600
we can see that...

539
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,160
Miss Fang Yan is so nervous now.

540
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,560
Let's give her a big round of applause...

541
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,160
to help her calm down.

542
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,200
Come on.

543
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,480
Don't be nervous.

544
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,600
Relax.

545
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,720
What should we do?

546
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,880
All right.

547
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,620
Let's enter the second session of
the ceremony.

548
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,240
Now, it's time for the couple to...

549
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,840
exchange their engagement rings.
