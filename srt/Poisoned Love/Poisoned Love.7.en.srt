Shi Yi, Goo Se accidentally
dirtied the harmonica you gave me.

But it didn't mean it, so...

That's awkward.

I have to tell him what Goo Se is?

15

[He left right after you did.]

He left?

37
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,800
The harmonica can get dirty.

Director change before shooting...

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,250
is quite common.

55

57
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,480

That's why. We just need to work hard.

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,160
or do something that we will regret.

174
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,100
Seems like the role...

175
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,760
really means a lot to you.

176
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,720
Your ears turned red.

177
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,350
Are you feeling hot?

178
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,150
Let me fan you.

179
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,060
Don't move.

180
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,280
It's even redder now.

181
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,440
It's too cold.

182
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,120
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,320
One moment.

184
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,960
Feeling warmer?

185
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,000
Taxi.

186
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,840
Hurry up. Taxi!

187
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Stop!

188
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,960
Let me down.

189
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,450
-Come on.
-Come on.

190
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,350
Slowly.

191
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,920
Be careful.

192
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,040
Sir, go to...

193
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,160
-The railway station.
-The railway station.

194
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,000
Okay.

195
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,690
Can you please speed up?

196

[Suzhou North Railway Station, Arrival]

197
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,370
Let's go.

198
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,170
-Is your ankle alright?
-I'm fine. Don't mind me.

199
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Just go.

200
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Come here.

201
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,410
Let's go.

202
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,960
Mr... Mr Shi.

203
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Why are you here?

204
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,320
-Fang...
-Director.

205
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,490
I'm Xiao Fang.

206
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,600
Mr Shi.

207
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,170
That's despicable.

208
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,520
How could you cheat my feelings?

209
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,680
What feelings?

210
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,650
The feeling of justice.

211
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,010
The feeling of a brother to his sister.

212
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,150
Nothing romantic,

213
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,160
anyway.

214
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,920
That's enough.

215
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Come on.

216
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,440
Every time we drink here,

217
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,080
we only talk about Water Utopia.

218
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,240
Because you only care about the film.

219
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,360
Furthermore,

220
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,680
we're both men.

221
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,570
What else can we talk about?

222
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,080
Love?

223
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,490
Do you know why I picked you?

224
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,240
I'm new in the film industry.

225
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
Young money.

226
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,980
Maybe because I listen to you.

227
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,800
I no longer do now,

228
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,760
as I rejected product placement.

229
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll get sacked.

230
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,960
I'd really sack you...

231
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,630
if you had compromised.

232
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,200
Why do we make film?

233
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,590
Is it for money?

234
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,900
There are many ways to make money.

235
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,560
It's because you're opinionated.

236
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,220
You want to express yourself,

237
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
and you'd share with your audience.

238
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,240
Water Utopia is a magical world.

239
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,840
But the magical world...

240
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,440
shows the care among humans.

241
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,680
And in order to bring this up,

242
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,000
we need someone others call...

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,730
fool who believes in idealism.

244
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,970
Do you think I'll let you go?

245
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,880
A fool who believes in idealism?

246
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,810
If I reject the sponsor,

247
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,600
what would you tell him?

248
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,660
He can withdraw the investment.

249
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,180
I'll fill the hole.

250
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,260
[He's stone-faced,
but has a heart of gold.]

251
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,120
Mr Shi.

252
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,120
Two fools.

253
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,320
To fools.

254
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,220
-Director.
-Are you alright?

255
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,770
Are you okay?

256
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,640
Xiao Fang.

257
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,770
You both...

258
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,780
are really something.

259
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,160
That was a good show.

260
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,690
You even deceived me, a director.

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,800
Drama queen.

262
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,800
Well, my body was weak at young age.

263
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,660
So, I imagined different voices
talking beside me.

264
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,080
Like Spongebob.

265
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Crayon Shin Chan.

266
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,580
One day I realised...

267
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,680
my voice could bring joy
to the people around me.

268
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,540
That's why I became a drama queen.

269
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,490
-Back to business.
-There, there.

270
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,839
That's a good one.

271
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,010
Cheers.

272
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,380
Director, have some honey water.

273
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,020
What are you still doing here?

274

-I...
-Go and sleep.

275
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,510
Hey.

276
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,720
You're living together?

277
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,840
No.

278

-We're just...
-Yeah.

280

You're hiding a lady in your house, huh?

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,760
No.

282
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,920
Don't laugh, Director.

283
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,400
That's not true.

284

Director, don't sleep here.

285

Don't sleep here.

286
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,640

Nothing.

Finally.

310

Go faster, it's downhill.

for having to do this every day.

319

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,680
Goo Se, let me save you.

347
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,970
I'll save you.

348
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,400
Just some old stuff.

349
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,700
Yet he made it sounds mysterious.

350
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,250
Little goose.

351
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,690
Don't touch anything.

352
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,290
Don't make trouble.

353
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,040
Clean the room and leave.

354
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,560
Good gracious.

355
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,680
Why is there a broken shelf here?

356
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,150
What a stingy rich guy.

357
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,230
I'd better buy a new one.

358
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,320
If that stone-faced
devil's hit by this thing...

359
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,960
Move.

360
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,240
Goo Se.

361
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,920
You're back.

362
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,660
Where's the director?

363
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,700
He thinks your cooking is bad.

364
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,220
So he left,
saying he's going to the company.

365
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,480
He hasn't tried anything.

366
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,080
But he said they're not nice?

367
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,030
Oh... By the way,

368
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,790
is Goo Se a good boy today?

369
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,280
Does it have to stay in the cage...

370
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,880
if I'm going to take it out?

371
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,590
Where are you taking it?

372
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,750
To Shi Yi's studio.

373
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,640
He said that he's going to use...

374
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,230
animal sounds in his new theme song.

375
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,360
Isn't that awesome?

376
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,600
I promised to bring Goo Se there
so that he can get more sounds.

377
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,400
Goo Se can't go. It has diarrhea.

378
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
Diarrhea? Is it severe?

379
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,200
Does it need a doctor?

380
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,720
No, it needs to rest at home.

381
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,490
And would you like to eat more?

382
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,080
No, they taste terrible.

383
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,180
You...

384
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,560
Don't get mad.

385
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,240
Or you'll get sick alone.

386
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,480
Let's forgive that sick guy.

387
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,530
You're not stupid, are you?

388
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,160
Diarrhea?

389
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But isn't goose poop always watery?

390
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,080
By the way,
you can't go to Shi Yi's place today.

391
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,040
Why?

392
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,200
Audition for Lake God at 2 p.m.

393
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
In the afternoon?

394
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,920
At two?

395
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,090
Oh my God.

396
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,880
Goo Se.

397
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,160
Come, come and save me.

398
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,520
Goo Se!

399
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,720
Goo Se, I'm counting on you.

400
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,200
Let's get started.

401
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,480
I'm here now.

402
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,680
Don't you have something to tell me?

403
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,480
Don't you have questions for me?

404
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,850
Or I have to ask you myself?

405
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,600
Do you...

406
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,400
love me or not?

407
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,800
What's with that expression?

408
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,280
Answer me.

409
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,010
I sound bad, don't I?

410
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,960
I think so too. What should I do?

411
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,120
It's okay. Give me another chance.
Try again.

412
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,280
Okay, calm down.

413
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,480
I'm here now.

414
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Don't you have something to tell me?

415
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,840
Such a brainless fan.

416
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,720
Fang Yan. Fang Yan!

417
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,690
He found out.

418
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,400
Oh, no. Will he want more money?

419
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,840
Goo Se, listen.

420
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,480
Even if I'm homeless,

421
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,320
I won't abandon you.

422
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,770
Give me power and courage.

423
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,680
-Awesome.
-Fang Yan!

424
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,050
I can explain. I didn't mean it.

425
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,080
When I was cleaning,

426
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
I found the door was open.

427
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,800
Goo Se's feathers flew inside.

428
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,920
So, I came in to clean it.

429
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,320
I saw the broken shelf.
To avoid people being hit,

430
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,180
I threw it away.

431
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,560
-Where's the shelf?
-The shelf...

432
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,760
Calm down, calm down.

433
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,680
I bought one that looks exactly the same.
It'll arrive in two days.

434
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,720
Where is it?

435
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,960
It...

436
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,000
Where is it?
