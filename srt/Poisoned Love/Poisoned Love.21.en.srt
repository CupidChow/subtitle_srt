[Episode 21]

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,460
After I've given it a thought,

5
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,520
I think the most reliable people
around me are you two.

6
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,440
This...

7
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,680
Shi Yi.

8
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
I've something to ask you.

9
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,120
What are you doing?

10
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,080
I miss you.

11
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,250
You miss me? Shi Yi's here.

12
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,630
-Shi...
-He's gone.

13
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Sit down.

14
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
Why is there a crack?

15
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,480
-Is it going to hatch?
-It's not time yet.

16
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,280
Did you break the egg?

17
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,000
Is it a stain?

18
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,960
A stain?

19
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,120
That's because you put it
in your smelly socks every day.

20
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,640
What's wrong with that?

21
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,360
The socks that just taken off
are much warmer than your silk scarf.

22
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,560
Just continue to quibble.

23
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,079
You've been careless since childhood.

24
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,040
That's why you broke the egg.

25
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,960
Ridiculous.

26
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,560
You overprotected the egg.

27
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,400
You always snatch it from me,
otherwise it wouldn’t break.

28
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,600
I overprotected it?

29
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,880
It wouldn't survive more than a day
without me.

30
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,840
Your creation skill out of nothing...

31
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,200
is getting better.

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,280
I create something out of nothing?

33
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,600
I suspect you're hiding something.

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,760
I said you fabricate accusation
and imagine without foundation.

35
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,960
I think you're opinionated.

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,400
You speak off the cuff.

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm done talking to you.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,079
Say it.

39
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,360
It's too hard on me!

40
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,400
Tell me.

41
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,320
Is that goose egg working?

42
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,800
How are they now?

43
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
At the beginning,

44
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,760
the two of them were harmonious.

45
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,520
I've never seen them so harmonious.

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,320
-Then?
-Trouble comes then.

47
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,880
They started to quarrel
like primary students.

48
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,010
And I don't understand
what are they quarrelling about.

49
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
Quarrel?

50
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,150
We planned it well back then.

51
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,200
We let them hatch the goose egg together,

52
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
talk about the past
and improve their relationship.

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,330
Their relationship might get better.

54
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,920
That's the funny problem.

55
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,520
Not only did their relationship
not get better,

56
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,000
but it got worse.

57
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,040
Is our method not direct enough?

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,840
For them,

59
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,880
I think they need to have...

60
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,160
a face-to-face soulful conversation.

61
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,480
Face-to-face?

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,080
It's hard for them to even meet,

63
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,720
but you want them
to have a face-to-face?

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,400
Mr Gu, this is today's report.
Please take a look.

65
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,200
Alright.

66
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,240
You're here.

67
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,240
Father.

68
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,120
Wei Wei?

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,280
Why are you here?

70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,159
Father.

71
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll fly back to Japan today.

72
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
I came to say goodbye.

73
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,050
Wei Wei, have a seat.

74
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,800
Talk with me.

75
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,560
Is everything alright in Japan?

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
Yes, Father.

77
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Don't worry.

78
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,840
Wei Wei.

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,930
Your mother left early.

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,730
Since childhood, you told me everything.

81
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
Now that you've grown up,

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,760
you won't talk to me anymore.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,520
That's not true, Father.

84
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,200
I just think it's boring.

85
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,040
I've liked someone for so long.

86
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,000
In the end,

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,760
I lost to a useless girl.

88
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,740
I forbid you to say so about yourself.

89
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,120
Wei Wei.

90
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,480
You're always the best in my heart.

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,720
I know you treat me the best.

92
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,640
I have a magazine photo shoot tomorrow.

93
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,200
I can't hatch it, you do it.

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,080
I have meetings all day long,
how can I hatch it?

95
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,340
You're just sitting.

96
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,760
I need to stand.

97
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,170
Where can I keep the egg?

98
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,120
We've generally determined...

99
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,760
the publicity plan
for The Tale of Water Utopia.

100
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,840
Basically it's still online promotion.

101
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,200
We'll promote through...

102
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,480
broadcasting, television,

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,360
-Internet, new media and other platforms.
-Mr Shi, you're storing egg?

104
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,880
You didn't eat?

105
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,880
Mr Shi.

106
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,400
I've chosen these few platforms
for the promotion.

107
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,460
Please take a look.

108
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,560
I'll eat it if you don't.
I haven't eaten.

109
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,320
Mr Shi is really amazing.

110
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,000
Mr Shi's acute foresight spirit...

111
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,350
is worth learning.

112
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
Why?

113
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,720
Mr Shi is holding the goose egg now.

114
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,960
He's thinking about the sequel
of The Tale of Water Utopia, right?

115
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,799
It's like that.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,659
For the sequel, we'll make...

117
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,320
the prequel of the Lake God.

118
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Yes.

119
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,480
Don't you understand?

120
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,040
Is your understanding so poor?

121
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,210
The sequel of
The Tale of Water Utopia,

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,440
the prequel of the Lake God,
it all started with an egg.

123
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,840
Mr Shi is indeed amazing.

124
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,480
The spirit of experiencing
the character...

125
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,560
is really worthy
to be learnt by us, right?

126
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,400
-Yes.
-Applause.

127
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,560
Let's dismiss if there's nothing else.

128
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,880
Let's talk about the sequel next time.

129
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,560
What's this?

130
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,400
It's hard to explain.

131
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Anyway, this egg is very important.

132
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Brother.

133
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,600
I don't understand your hobby.

134
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,560
I'm serious.

135
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,000
Mr Shi.

136
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,760
Mr Gu is looking for you.

137
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,890
Do you have time now?

138
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Yes.

139
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,760
Alright.

140
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,440
Go.

141
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,880
For the prequel of the Lake God,

142
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll leave it to you.

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,800
I...

144
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,600
You're safe if the egg is safe.

145
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,640
If the egg breaks,

146
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,360
you'll die.

147
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,080
No, I...

148
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,880
No, I...

149
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,320
Why do you want to see me today, Uncle Gu?

150
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,080
Why do you call me Uncle Gu?

151
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,220
Just say it if anything, Uncle Gu.

152
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,760
Back then, I started a business...

153
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,840
with your father
and a few best friends.

154
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,280
I'm ranked sixth.

155
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,340
You've been calling me "Sixth Uncle"
since childhood.

156
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,480
Yeah.

157
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,720
But in the end,

158
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,370
it's only you and my father.

159
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,160
I just have you as my uncle.

160
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,220
You watched me grow up as well.

161
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,040
I watched you grow up,

162
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,240
but recently you've become...

163
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
more and more strange to me.

164
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,120
This is your personal affair,

165
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,860
I don't want to intervene,

166
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,480
but since you got together with...

167
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,290
the voice actor of the Lake God,

168
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,400
you often abandon public affairs
for personal affairs.

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,600
You're not steady at all.

170
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,880
I heard that the girl is abnormal.

171
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,640
I don't know if she's pretending...

172
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,360
or has scheme.

173
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,520
Anyway, just listen to me...

174
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,980
and stay away from her.

175
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,560
Did Gu Wei tell you all this?

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,480
Wei Wei was so angry
that she went back to Japan.

177
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,440
She's so capable.

178
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,610
If your father was here,

179
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,000
he won't let you marry her too.

180
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,320
Since you want to talk about Fang Yan,

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,560
I can explain it clearly.

182
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,920
Fang Yan is my girlfriend.

183
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,840
She's a very nice girl.

184
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Besides,

185
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,010
this is my personal affair.

186
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,250
You don't have the right to intervene.

187
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
It's true that...

188
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,170
when the child grows up,

189
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
he'll have his own thinking.

190
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll leave now.

191
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,680
No matter what,
you should respect Mr Gu.

192
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,060
Fang Yan is my girlfriend.

193
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,600
If anyone talks about her,

194
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,960
I should protect her.

195
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
A man.

196
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,640
You're a man.

197
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,760
Shi’s a man.

198
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,920
Shi Yi, you're back.

199
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,240
How was your photo shoot?

200
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,100
It's finished.

201
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
Shi Meng...

202
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,780
has always cherished this little goose.

203
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,560
You have one too?

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,330
Our father gave it to us.

205
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,700
When we were young,

206
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,960
we hatched a goose egg together.

207
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,320
The egg broke.

208
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,280
Our father doesn't want us to be sad.

209
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,680
So, he carved
two small wooden geese for us.

210
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
I can't treat your illness anymore.

211
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,220
Can I still share my secrets with you?

212
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,260
Do you remember...

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,530
the story of the two brothers I told you about?

214
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,090
You should have guessed it.

215
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,290
I'm that elder brother.

216
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,440
At that time,

217
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,360
I lost Shi Meng.

218
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,320
When we were young,

219
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,210
I had always been better
than Shi Meng in everything.

220
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,360
I had always been the role model
for Shi Meng.

221
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,600
Sometimes,

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
I feel sorry for him.

223
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,770
That's because he always got scolded.

224
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,160
But when I knew I was adopted,

225
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,160
all the pride...

226
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,200
and superiority,

227
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,060
even the most basic sense of security...

228
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,760
were ruined.

229
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,960
[Shi Meng.]

230
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,110
[Brother.]

231
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,320
[Do I have any birthday surprises?]

232
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,690
[Come, I'll take you on an adventure.]

233
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,480
[Let's play a game.]

234
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,600
[You count to 100 here.]

235
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,120
[No peeking.]

236
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,920
[One.]

237
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,920
[Two.]

238
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,000
[Three.]

239
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,200
[Four.]

240
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,320
[Five.]

241
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,360
[Six.]

242
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,520
[Seven.]

243
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,840
[Eight.]

244
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,120
[Nine.]

245
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,360
[Ten.]

246
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,720
[Eleven.]

247
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,680
[Twelve.]

248
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
I thought that...

249
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,840
after leaving him,

250
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,240
[I’d be relieved.]

251
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
However,

252
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,840
the moment I left him,

253
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,440
I regretted it.

254
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,560
[Shi Meng!]

255
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,720
[Shi Meng!]

256
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,280
[Shi Meng!]

257
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,320
[Shi Meng!]

258
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,160
[Where are you?]

259
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,010
I went back to search for him desperately.

260
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,120
But it was too late.

261
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,600
[Shi Meng.]

262
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,360
[Where did you go?]

263
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,040
[Shi Meng!]

264
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,000
After you said it,

265
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,280
do you feel better?

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,640
Actually, have you ever thought about
telling Shi Meng?

267
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,840
Apologize to him.

268
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,200
Tell him you're sorry.

269
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,000
Maybe it's not as hard as you think.

270
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,240
You know what?

271
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,840
When some damage...

272
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
is too big to be mentioned,

273
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,720
I really don't know how to say it.

274
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,530
Why do you come here
if you're not skating?

275
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,970
Isn't it nice to revisit the old place?

276
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,200
Besides,

277
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:12,119
don't you think this place
looks familiar?

278
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,160
Yeah.

279
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,079
The place where I was kidnapped
when I was a kid...

280
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,280
is just nearby.

281
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,119
When you think about the past,

282
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,480
do you still feel scared?

283
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,160
No.

284
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,680
Just when I think about the girl
who was kidnapped with me,

285
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,640
I wonder how she is right now.

286
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,280
She's so young,
she won't remember you.

287
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,120
Are you jealous?

288
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,360
No.

289
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
What girl?

290
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,160
I didn't tell you...

291
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,800
but when I am

292
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
there's a little boy...

293
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
in my mind.

294
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,920
He holds my hand.

295
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
Enough.

296
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,800
[Fang Yan]

297
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,240
[Superstar, this is my third wish.]

298
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,560
[I hope you can come here.]

299
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,620
[Shi Meng has something to tell you.]

300
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,800
You're hiding something.

301
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,240
No.

302
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,760
Fine.

303
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,440
That's it?

304
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,360
You're not worried at all?

305
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm confident about myself.

306
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,900
Don't you want to know my secrets?

307
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,370
You'll tell me if you want to say it.

308
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Besides,

309
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,560
with your brain,

310
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
it's good to keep more secrets.

311
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,120
The capacity will become larger.

312
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Do you see my fist as big as a punch bag?

313
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,240
I...

314
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,400
Do you have any secrets...

315
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,120
that you can tell me?

316
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,640
What secret do I have?

317
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,450
The secret between you and Shi Yi
when you were young.

318
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,640
Come with me.

319
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,280
Shi Yi dumped me here.

320
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,360
[You count to 100 here.]

321
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,040
[No peeking.]

322
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,720
[Brother!]

323
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,520
[Brother, where are you?]

324
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,080
[Stop playing, alright?]

325
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,720
[I'm a little scared.]

326
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,320
It's alright, it has passed.

327
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,360
I asked you out today...

328
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,080
because there's something important
to tell you.

329
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,880
What's wrong?

330
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,400
You become so prudent
when talking to me now.

331
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,040
It's about Shi Yi.

332
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,440
Shi Yi told me...

333
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
after he left you,

334
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,280
he regretted it and went back
to look for you immediately.

335
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,160
It shouldn't be you who tell me these.

336
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,720
I know it shouldn't be me,

337
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,160
but if he has no courage...

338
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,440
to tell you,

339
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,840
are you going to hold grudge
on him forever?

340
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
-After all, it's because...
-Because he was adopted?

341
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,900
When I learned from Zuo You...

342
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,640
that Shi Yi was adopted,

343
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,640
I’d already forgiven him.

344
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,560
Actually, I understand him.

345
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,680
He couldn't face me...

346
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,920
not because he's afraid that
I won't forgive him.

347
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,320
He's afraid that he can't forgive himself.

348
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,400
But...

349
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,540
I know you're doing it for my own good.

350
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,320
But there're certain things that
we can't do anything at all.

351
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,800
Just let it be.

352
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,040
But I still want to thank you...

353
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,400
for everything you did.

354
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,960
Without you,

355
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,760
I don't know how to face all these.

356
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,840
Thank you.

357
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,280
You're welcome.

358
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I know you want Shi Yi to come here...

359
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,040
to solve the rancour between us.

360
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,570
I understand your intentions.

361
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,640
Shi Yi still can't face it.

362
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,080
Your road to reconciliation...

363
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,880
is really long.

364
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,300
But I still want to thank you
for everything you did.

365
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,800
If not for you,

366
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
I wouldn't be able to face all these too.

367
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,680
Thanks for accompanying me.

368
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,680
Do you remember the story...

369
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,610
of the little girl I told you about?

370
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,080
This...

371
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,080
is where we got kidnapped.

372
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,480
What's wrong?

373
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,560
I've been here.

374
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,960
Fang Yan?

375
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
[Mother.]

376
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,200
[I want my mother.]

377
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,440
[I want my mother.]

378
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,760
[Mother.]

379
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,360
[Mother.]

380
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
-[Let's go.]
-[Bring me the ledger now.]

381
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,720
[Otherwise,
you'll never see your son again!]

382
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,560
[I won't believe you again.]

383
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,880
[Zhang has told me.]

384
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,820
[You're going to call the police
to capture me.]

385
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,120
[Hide here.]

386
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,160
[Let's go.]

387
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,840
I remember it.

388
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,560
[Brother, save me!]

389
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,880
[Brother!]

390
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,720
[Brother!]

391
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,920
[Brother!]

392
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,320
[Brother.]

393
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,000
[Brother, I can't run anymore.]

394
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,140
[Wait for me here.]

395
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,480
[I'll find someone to save you.]

396
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
[Brother, I'm scared.]

397
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,680
[Don't be scared,
just treat this as a nightmare.]

398
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,640
[It'll be gone when you wake up.]

399
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,600
[I'm afraid of nightmares.]

400
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,520
[Don't worry.]

401
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,720
[I'll chase away everything
in your nightmares.]

402
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,520
You remember everything
that happened back then?

403
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,100
I just remember these things.

404
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,760
I went back to look for you,

405
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,080
but you were not there.

406
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Where did you go?

407
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,160
I...

408
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,360
I can't remember.

409
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,240
I just know I was afraid.

410
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,640
It's alright.

411
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,840
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,280
I can't remember anything.

413
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,560
Fang Yan.

414
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,080
I guess your cause has been found.

415
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
According to what you two said,

416
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,560
you two were kidnapped
at the same time,

417
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,080
Fang Yan suffers from
derealisation parasomnia...

418
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,120
due to extreme fear.

419
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,120
The only picture you couldn't remember...

420
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,160
should be the biggest source
of your fear.

421
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,920
Does that mean...

422
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,320
if she remembers it...

423
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,640
and faces her fear,

424
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,920
her sleepwalking can be cured?

425
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,260
It's highly possible.

426
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Then I...

427
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,640
I can't remember anything.

428
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,360
It's alright.

429
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,120
You'll remember it sooner or later.

430
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,640
We have a lot of time.

431
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,840
I didn't expect the little brother
in my dreams are you.

432
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,960
You seem disappointed.

433
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,800
Really?

434
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,940
You're chatting with other man
at this time?

435
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,160
It's not suitable.

436
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,650
No, it's Shi Yi.

437
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,200
I wanted to arrange...

438
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,440
a confrontation for you two
in the woods today.

439
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,160
But he didn't come.

440
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
It's not surprising.

441
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,440
You.

442
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
You have a lover now.

443
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,240
Don't be greedy.

444
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,640
Don't think of other people...

445
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,120
under the guise
of helping us to reconcile.

446
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,480
Let's go.

447
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,360
You pinched my face just now.

448
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,560
One.

449
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,640
Two.

450
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,120
Three.

451
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,200
Four.

452
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,520
Five.

453
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Six.

454
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,480
Seven.

455
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,820
What are you counting?

456
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,320
We'll follow God's willing this time.

457
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,960
See if the tenth person I counted...

458
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,480
is a couple.

459
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,200
Nine.

460
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,200
Ten.

461
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,160
It's a couple.

462
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,520
Are you still thinking
about what Dr. Cui said?

463
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,920
No.

464
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,960
I just want to know...

465
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,360
what I saw that day.

466
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,080
Enough, stop thinking.

467
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,640
I'll be with you from now on.

468
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,600
Even if your sickness won't be cured,

469
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,240
at least it won't get worse.

470
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,880
For those unpleasant memories,

471
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,680
don't think about it anymore.

472
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,960
[Xiao Liu!]

473
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,120
Xiao Liu?

474
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,840
What?

475
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,170
I remember it.

476
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,290
Xiao Liu!
