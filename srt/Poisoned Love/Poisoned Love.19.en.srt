You said you love him, didn't you?

Prove it to me.

Prove it to me! Do it now!

-Are you okay?

Stop acting in front of me, liars!

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,440
You are treating me like a fool.

-Xiao K!
-You've hurt me, and Shi Yi too.

I won't let you ruin Shi Yi.

Why are you being so troublesome?

42
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,040
Leaving you is troublesome,

43
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,760
but so is staying with you.

44
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,800

However,

I've done for you.

If I were given another chance,

72

I would still choose to stay by your side.

Xiao K's case will be transferred
to court really soon.

She will have to face
the legal consequences...

75
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,490

By the way, is there anything
you'd like to tell her?

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,860

78

Don't worry, I will protect the scarf

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,820
Shi Yi,

100
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,740
you want to bid the past farewell,

101
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,100
but you don't know how to do it.

102
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,700
Do you know what is the most
effective way to cure unhappiness?

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,540
The cure is to fall in love.

104
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,260
When you love someone,

105
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,680
you want her to understand how you feel.

106
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,220
You want to know...

107
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,460
if the feeling is mutual.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,060
To me, when you are in love with someone,

109
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,380
you should say it out loud.

110
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,100
You should pursue her
if you really like her!

111
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,660
Come in.

112
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,260
Actually,

113
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,850
the things you decided not to say
the other day...

114
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,340
I know what they are.

115
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,380
Don't you care about Fang Yan's illness?

116
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,500
I am here to talk about it.

117
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
As you can see,

118
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,660
Fang Yan won't be happy
even if I let her go.

119
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,140
You don't wish to see Fang Yan
live in misery, do you?

120
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,660
You want her to get better.

121
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,660
Am I right?

122
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,980
As long as we can cure her illness,

123
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,660
besides leaving her,

124
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,640
I will agree to anything.

125
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,620

It's me of course!

129
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,420
It smells so good! Do you want to try it?

130
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,720
-No.
-Please take a bite.

131
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,120
-No.
-It smells so good!

132
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Try it.

133
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,060
-I don't like it.
-I put a lot of effort into it.

134

Open your mouth.

Open wider.

136
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,500
You look so cute!

Let's capture this precious moment...

How about this?

In order to commemorate our re-union,

141
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,580
I'll post the photo on Moments.
Don't forget to "like".

142
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,260
Okay.

143
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,960
I can't see the post.

144
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,380
How is that possible?

145
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,260
You deleted me?

146
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,580
-You deleted me just because we broke up?
-No such thing.

147
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,860
What a merciless woman.

148
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,640
You don't love me enough.

149
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,360
I don't love you enough?

150
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,640
You deleted me from your friend's list!

151
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,160
If you really love me,

152
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,320
you would have found out about it earlier!

153
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
You would have sent me messages.

154
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,040
You would've seen my Moments.
If you love me,

155
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,240
you wouldn't have waited.

156
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,640
How could you blame me for that?

157
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,300
If you really love me...

158
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,300
It's my fault.

159
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,120
Say it.

160
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,530
How do I make it up to you?

161
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,740
Kiss me.

162
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,580
I was almost shocked to death.

163
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,480
Do you have to be so punctual?

164
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
I've always been a punctual person.

165
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,280
Shi Yi, why are you here?

166
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,720
Why? Am I not welcome?

167
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,260
Of course you're welcome.

168
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,340
My place has become a crime scene.

169
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,660

I might have to trouble you for some time.

171
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,720
Your room is over there.
Clean it yourself.

172
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,560
[Perhaps this is the right time...]

173
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,680
[for them to patch things up.]

174
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,600
I'll go to my room.

175
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,720
Okay.

176
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,660
Tell you what, let me help you out.

177
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,460
Hold on.

178
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,800
If you think his presence
makes you awkward,

179
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,060
I shall...

180
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,440
Of course not!

181
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,680
Seeing you two make up...

182
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,640
is exactly what I want.

183
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
Besides, I've stayed with Shi Yi before.

184
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,160
We are close friends.

185
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,460
I shall help him out.

186
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,420
Shi Yi, let me help you!

187
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,100
As long as we can cure her illness,

188
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,740
besides leaving her,

189
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,660
I will agree to anything.

190
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,780
You will agree to anything?

191
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,960
Fine.

192
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,240
From now on,

193
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,359
for a month,

194
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,640
you're not to be close
to Fang Yan emotionally,

195
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,980
or physically.

196
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,940
I shall have a month time
to pursue Fang Yan.

197
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,440
If I can't make her fall...

198
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,220
in love with me within a month,

199
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,060
I'll be her antidote
without any complaint.

200
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,420
What's the matter?

201
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,819
Are you scared?

202
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,579
I have nothing to fear.

203
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,440
Even if I stop having
physical contact with her,

204
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,240
it won't stop her from liking me.

205
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,700
I'll stay at your place
for the coming month.

206
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,600
What?

207
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,340
If Fang Yan falls sick,

208
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,860
I can take care of her. Isn't that great?

209
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,060
What are you doing?

210
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,160
Kiss me.

211
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,720
It's been days since we've kissed.

212
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,140
I am pouring coffee.

213
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,980
Why are you being so cold towards me?

214
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,240
No such thing.

215
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,380
Then kiss me.

216
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,040
Have some coffee.

217
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,100
Here.

218
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,920
I don't drink coffee.

219
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,100
I just want you to kiss me.

220
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,180
Never go beyond 40 decibel
when you talk at home.

221
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,360
Have you forgotten?

222
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,640
I didn't know there's such a rule.

223
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,680
You bet there is.

224
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,220
I am a man of principles.

225
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,480
I know that you are a man of principles,

226
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,180
but aren't we lovers again?

227
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,100
I just want a kiss.

228
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
You don't love me anymore, is that it?

229
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,740
Fine, just one kiss.

230
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,180
What are you doing?

231
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,760
What does that mean?

232
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,940
I...

233
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,540
I didn't mean anything.

234
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,220
So you don't cherish me anymore?

235
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,960
You are such a bad guy!

236
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,340
Darn it!

237
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,460
Shi Meng.

238
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,700
What are you doing?

239
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,020
Can't you see I am making coffee?

240
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,220
Are you?

241
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,180
Can I have a cup?

242
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,380
Make it yourself.

243
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,180
Is it even edible?

244
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,700
Aren't you going to work?

245
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,380
I am not in a rush.

246
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,380
I am not in a rush either.

247
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,860
If you guys won't go, I will.

248
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,340
-Where to?
-Where to?

249
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,100
It is a secret.

250
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,340
What kind of girl does Shi Meng like?

251
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,120
You should not ask me that question.

252
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,900
You are his girlfriend.

253
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,480
I am his girlfriend...

254
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,520
-but you are his best friend.
-So?

255
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,160
So you should know what kind of girl...

256
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,980
he's fond of.

257
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,360
That's the thing.

258
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,940
I have a feeling that Shi Meng...

259
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,180
has grown tired of my appearance.

260
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,420
Very perceptive.

261
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,920
You have a bright future.

262
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,840
However, I can tell you
what kind of girl he's fond of.

263
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,960
In return,

264
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,080
don't you think you should tell me...

265
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,660
things about Zuo Yao?

266
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,500
-Hao Ying Jun!
-Yes.

267
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
Listen,

268
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,080
-you underestimate me.
-I am just...

269
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,720
Betraying a best friend...

270
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,420
is the last thing I, Fang Yan,
will ever do!

271
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,460
If that is the case,

272
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,300
I, Hao Ying Jun, am very annoyed...

273
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,040
because you don't respect me at all.

274
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,680
Let me tell you.

275
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,000
I, Hao Ying Jun,

276
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,060
would never betray...

277
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,000
Shi Meng loves movies.

278
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,840
I know that.

279
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Zuo Yao loves Zuo You.

280
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
-What does Shi Meng like?
-Angelina Jolie's lips.

281
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,960
Who is Zuo You's father?

282
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,320
Zuo You's father is not his father.
Tell me more!

283
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,520
He admires Marilyn Monroe's figure.

284
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,760
Not his father? What do you mean?

285
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,440
Zuo You had a father but he's missing.

286
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,320
-Go on!
-He likes Audrey Hepburn's temperament.

287
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
Why is he missing?

288
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,020
Because his father
is not who you think it is.

289
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,940
Keep going!

290
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,560
"Who I think it is?"

291
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
I didn't think anything.

292
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,800
Who is whom's father?

293
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,040
-I don't even know who my father is.
-Enough.

294
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,400
His father does not exist.

295
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,480
I have got what I want.

296
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,080
You've said enough. We're done here.

297
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,880
Goodbye.

298
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,880
What did I say?

299
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,240
I don't even know what I've said...

300
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
or what you've said.

301
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,220
Who is the father? Father!

302
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,660
What is wrong?

303
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,520
Am I not sexy?

304
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,620
Well...

305
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,900
I know.

306
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,580
Hello.

307
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,060
I am Laura.

308
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,260
My mission...

309
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,980
is you.

310
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,500
Do you want breakfast?

311
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,220
No.

312
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,700
Do you want to have breakfast with me?

313
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,780
Yes.

314
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,380
How do you feel?

315
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,300
Feel?

316
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,580
What feeling should I have?

317
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,520
I don't care about what I think.

318
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,500
I care about what you think.

319
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,140
I think...

320
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
you are great at cosplaying.

321
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,940
Cosplay?

322
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,540
Cosplay?

323
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,020
Isn't cosplaying a norm
among your friends?

324
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,060
Aren't you excited?

325
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,140
Excited?

326
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,940
Check out my body.

327
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,020
Look at my back.

328
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,180
Look at my hairstyle.

329
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,940
Look at my face.

330
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,740
I got it.

331
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,140
Excited.

332
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,900
No

333
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,520
You men...

334
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,140
are all liars.

335
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,520
You like Angelina Jolie's lips...

336
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,180
and Marilyn Monroe's legs, don't you?

337
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,540
Why are you...

338
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,860
-Who told you that?
-Hao Ying Jun.

339
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,960
How could you believe him?

340
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,900
I believed him.

341
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,480
Enough.

342
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,900
Silly girl.

343
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,700
I like you...

344
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,500
for you.

345
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Not all these.

346
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,880
Are you serious?

347
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,220
Of course.

348
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,420
The song that stopped half way...

349
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,480
Do I still have the chance
to play it for you?

350
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,300
What should we watch?

351
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,440
How about this one?

352
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,170
"Interview with the Vampire"?

353
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,620
Yes.

354
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,520
I am doing a desensitization treatment.

355
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,760
Besides, both of you are here.

356
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,940
I won't feel scared.

357
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,920
Both of you are overreacting.

358
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,560
It's not that serious.

359
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,780
Aren't you scared?

360
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,560
Of course not.

361
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,240
He is a vampire.

362
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,460
He is not a ghost.

363
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,100
I...

364
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,120
What is that?

365
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,100
My goodness!

366
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,040
No way.

367
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,600
I need to use the washroom.

368
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,020
Let's take a break.

369
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,620
You can't blame me.

370
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,130
She jumped into my arms.

371
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,600
Let's switch our seats.

372
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,560
Why?

373
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,880
You have violated the rules.

374
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,260
Twice.

375
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,260
Fine, let's do it.

376
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Come here.

377
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,660
Come here.

378
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
Why did he appear from the right!

379
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,340
That is so scary!

380
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,440
That is so scary!

381
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,380
Stop watching.

382
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,280
Rest early.

383
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,340
Shi...

384
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,700
What is wrong with Shi Yi?

385
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,160
I don't know.

386
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,680
Is it because he doesn't like
the movie that I chose?

387
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,100
No, let's keep watching.

388
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,140
I was almost scared to death.

389
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,570
Do you want some snacks?

390
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,320
I am going to work.

391
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,580
Hold on.

392
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,820
-What is wrong?
-Nothing.

393
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,840
It's beating.

394
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,940
It's beating.

395
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,220
It's beating.

396
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,640
Aren't you going to your studio?

397
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,180
I am taking a break.

398
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
It's good to take a break.

399
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,010
After all, you will have to leave soon.

400
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,960
Darling.

401
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,740
When you are at home,
please take good care of...

402
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,140
the guest.

403
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,620
I promise I will.

404
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,840
I am leaving.

405
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,320
Bye. Stay safe.

406
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,300
Bye.

407
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,260
Shi Yi.

408
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,780
I need...

409
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,380
a favor from you.

410
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,220
I am ready. Let's do it!

411
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,960
Superstar, can you be serious?

412
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,500
I want a scary face, not a cute face.

413
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,480
Well...

414
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,960
I don't understand.
Why do you want me to scare you?

415
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,400
-What if you relapse again?
-It's desensitization treatment.

416
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Desensitization treatment?

417
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,240
It means...

418
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,320
to slowly expose myself to things
that frighten me...

419
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,600
or terrify me.

420
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,400
In simple terms,
I am training myself to be bold.

421
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,920
Dr Cui told me about the treatment.

422
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
So stop worrying
and let me experiment, okay?

423
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,040
-Let's try again.
-Sure.

424
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,980
-Can you do it? Thank you.
-Sure.

425
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,700
All the best.

426
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,740
Okay.

427
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,760
Superstar!

428
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,960
We are doing this for real.

429
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,960
You see...

430
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,640
The lighting, sound effect and story line
should come together.

431
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,540
You look too good.

432
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,600
How are you going to scare me like that?

433
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,160
You're too handsome.

434
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,660
This won't do.

435
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,260
It's quite scary.

436
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,180
Where is the scary thing?

437
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,120
You....

438
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,820
Can't you see it?

439
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,700
Goodbye.

440
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,410
Goodbye, my friend.

441
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,940
Superstar.

442
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,720
You did it.

443
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,520
Sound effects, lighting and story line
came together.

444
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,160
Not to mention the twist at the end.

445
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,700
It's marvelous!

446
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,540
It's not bad I guess.

447
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,280
It's a shame that
you are not a screenwriter.

448
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,900
Someone said that to me too.

449
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,800
Hold on.

450
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,210
Why do I feel that
you are being sarcastic?

451
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,950
Fang Yan.

452
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,090
Why put yourself through
desensitization treatment?

453
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,980
To be honest,

454
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,520
Dr Cui had suggested...

455
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,060
desensitization treatment a long time ago.

456
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,420
However, I didn't like the idea.

457
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,220
I kept running away from it...

458
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,780
because I was worried
someone might laugh at me.

459
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,240
I was worried about relapsing...

460
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
and being looked down upon.

461
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,980
What made you decide to try it?

462
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,500
It's because of Shi Meng.

463
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,780
I really want to be with him.

464
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,200
I don't want anything to happen
because of my illness.

465
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,760
We just got back together
after a rough patch.

466
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
I don't want things to turn sour
because of my illness.

467
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,220
Fang Yan.

468
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,900
I am sorry.

469
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,620
Fang Yan.
