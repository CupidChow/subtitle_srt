00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,900
on this day every year,

343
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,580
Shi Yi will be here to
celebrate their birthday.

344
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,560
I am grateful for him.

345
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,040
Madam Principal.

346
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,440
You did well.

347
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,440
The kids are having a great time.

348
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,240
I can tell they like you a lot.

349
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,840
I like them as well.

350
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,560
I heard everything from the principal.

351
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
On this day every year,

352
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,880
you would be here to
celebrate their birthday.

353
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,440
Shi Yi, you are so kind.

354
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,680
It's not kindness.

355
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,760
It's empathy.

356
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,670
I never knew...

357
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,400
when my real birthday is.

358
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,840
How is it possible?

359
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,280
I was adopted.

360
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,280
When I was very young,

361
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,480
my parents adopted me.

362
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,600
Then soon after that,

363
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,620
my mother got pregnant with Shi Meng.

364
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,760
Then...

365
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,810
Shi Meng and I grew up together.

366
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,170
Our parents were nice to both of us.

367
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,380
They treated us as their own children,
they were never favouring anyone.

368
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,840
Which is why I had never
known my own origin.

369
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,480
Until I was ten,

370
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,760
I found out...

371
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,860
by coincidence...

372
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,160
that I was adopted.

373
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,780
What's the matter?

374
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,280
Judging by your look,

375
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,920
you don't seem surprised by my story,

376
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,240
but more like...

377
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
I were some sort of monster.

378
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,040
Not at all.

379
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,760
I am glad you were adopted.

380
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,840
I didn't mean that.

381
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,800
I mean foster parents
are parents, nonetheless.

382
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,520
I didn't mean it.

383
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,840
All right, I know what you mean.

384
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,640
Besides,

385
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
I don't want my story...

386
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
to affect your thoughts on me

387
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,800
No way, that won't happen.

388
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,960
But Shi Meng...

389
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,940
I have never brought this up
with anyone.

390
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,290
That includes Shi Meng.

391
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,520
Shi Yi.

392
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,440
Thank you for trusting me.

393
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,000
Thank you...

394
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,130
for sharing your secret...

395
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,720
just to cure my illness

396
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,040
It feels good to let it out.

397
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,320
I feel better too.

398
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,290
After all, some secrets...

399
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,080
can't be kept to one's self.

400
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,730
That should be enough, I'll send you home.

401
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,360
Leave me be.

402
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,000
What's wrong?
Are you still bothered by my secret?

403
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,040
No, it's just a lot to take in.

404
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,190
Fang Yan.

405
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,160
At this rate,

406
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,200
I would regret ever telling you.

407
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,520
Sharing secrets...

408
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,020
shouldn't be a burden for you.

409
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,410
I don't feel any burden.

410
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,120
I feel like...

411
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
I just know a whole new
aspect of you.

412
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,120
I am glad you feel that way.

413
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,850
Today is for some quiet time
and sharing stories.

414
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,520
Enjoy the view.

415
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,920
The scenery here is pretty.

417
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160

00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,720
It's okay, go ahead.

425
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,400
Hao Ying Jun, what is it this time?

[Shi Meng got into an accident,
come here at once!]

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,060
What happened to Shi Meng?

429
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,280
Is he in trouble?

430
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,880
Where are you now?

00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,620

[Operating Theater]

442
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,340
Is the patient's family here yet?

443
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,520
Why is this happening?

444
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,050
You can't go in there,
surgery is ongoing.

Leave it to the doctors.

448
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,840
Shi Meng will be fine.

449
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,920
How did he get into the accident?

450

He...

451

Answer me!

452
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,960
He wanted to go to the gym.

453
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,510
But he went too far.

454
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,660
He was on the treadmill the whole day.

455
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,440
Then he wanted to run home.

456
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,240
This is my fault.

457
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,640
I should have followed him.

458
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,920
I should have kept an eye on him.

However...

462
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
you should calm down.
