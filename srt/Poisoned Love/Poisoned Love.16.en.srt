Nice shot.

Serve the ball.

7
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,710
I almost didn't
make the shot.

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,760
Where is he?

9
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm having a sip.

We need to alternate
work with rest.

Why did you need to bring
your girlfriend to this game?

I don't think I can

Here is fine.

We're not there yet.

21
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,480
I don't think I can
invite you in today.

22
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,190
Zuo Yao is at home.
I don't want her to misunderstand us.

23
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,120
Misunderstand?

24
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,770
Why would she misunderstand us?

25
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,880
Because I didn't return
for the past two nights.

26
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,520
With you sending me
back home today,

27
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,920
I'm afraid she's going
to misunderstand.

28
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
Silly.

29
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,550
Looks like Zuo Yao really
does care about you.

30
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,870
Yes, she's like my real sister.

31
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,360
She always takes care of me.

32
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,280
It's okay.

33
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,320
After this, I'll take care of you.

Are you free tonight?

35
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,800
I want to invite you out for dinner.

36
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,840
I have something to tell you.

37
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,300
Can't you tell it to me now?

38
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,640
I can't say it now,

39
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,840
I need to prepare first.

40
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,080
Okay, I get it.

41
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
I'll go first.

42
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,410
Aren't you forgetting something?

43
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,940
Hurry up and go.

44
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,600
Then I'll be leaving first.

45
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm really leaving.

46

What time is it now, Superstar?

47
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,570
Why are you here so early?

48
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,280
I got dumped.

49
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
I need treatment.

50
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,600
Dumped?

51
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Was it Fang Yan?

52
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,040
I knew it.

53
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,440
You both are not just best friends.

54
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,720
But to her,

55
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm just a friend.

56
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,480
Friend?

57
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,200
You two are destined to be together.

58
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,440
Destined?

59
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,909
Since the last press conference,

60
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,990
the moment she fell into your arms,

61
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,680
it is obvious that you are the only one
in the world who can save her.

62
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,760
And you're saying that
this is not destiny?

63
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,200
She fell into my arms?

64
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,240

She was sick.

67
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,960
She got better...

68
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,660
after you held her.

69
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,720
Stop.

70
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,480
Yao Yao, why are you up so early?

71
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,240
Was it because I'm early

72
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,840
or did someone came home really late?

73
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,520
Keep it down.
What if Zuo You heard you?

74
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,810
-If there's nothing else, I'm heading in.
-Wait.

75

Come here.

76
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,320
Come here.

Sit.

78
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,260
Let me ask you this.

79
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,160
Where did you go for
the past two nights?

80
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,040
Didn't I tell you?

81
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,640
I ran into my

82
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,480
high school classmate...

83
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,000
High school classmate?

84
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,160
So you went out
to play for two days?

85
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,510
Which high school classmate?

86
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,550
Da Wang or Xiao Li?

87
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,680
- Let me call and ask.
- No, don't!

88
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,760
I'll tell you the truth.

89
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,760
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,630
I'm sorry Yao Yao.

91
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,480
I shouldn't have lied to you.

92
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,000
But this is a

93
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,340
long story.

94
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,150
Well, I'll try to make it short.

95
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,590
So you two have been together
after you got out of the hospital?

96
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,300
And you even ate dumplings together,

97
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,230
and you spend the nights together.

98
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,280
But our overnight stay is not...

99
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,420
the kind that
you're thinking about.

100
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,280
We just held our hands for two nights.

101
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,830
Why do you look so disappointed?

102
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,600
No, I'm not.

103
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,520
Fang Yan, I am being serious here.

104
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,280
Do you have a death wish?

105
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,960
I've already told you.

106
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,430
You cannot be in a romantic relationship
until you get better.

107
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,490
What's more your partner is Shi Meng.

108
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,400
He is not what you think.

109
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,600
He treats me very well.

110
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,440
Treats you well?

111
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,600
How well is it?

112
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,400
It seems like you are blinded by love.

113
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,560
You know who Shi Meng is.

114
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,080
He's a filmmaker.

115
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,990
He has all sorts of women
by his side.

116
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,080
He can leave you any time he wants.

117
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,280
Let me tell you.

118
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,680
All men are the same.

119
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,180
They are all unreliable.

120
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,800
You cannot generalise them like that.

121
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,360
Just because you don't
trust in love,

122
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,270
doesn't mean I do too.

123
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,320
Moreover,

124
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,880
this is my first time
being in a relationship.

125
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,600
Can't I dream about love for a bit?

126
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,360
Sure.

127
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,840
You can dream.

128
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,480
Then go and tell Shi Meng.

129
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,220
Tell him about your illness.

130
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,450
Tell him that you need to hug and kiss
Shi Yi when you have a relapse.

131
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,730
See if he can accept it.

132
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,520
I will tell him!

133
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,840
You don't need to remind me of it.

134
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,480

135

-Hello, Brother Shi Yi.

141
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,560
When I have a relapse,

142
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,770
I hope that you can
hold me in your arms.

143

You two are destined to be together.

Remember our date for tonight.

I have something important to tell you.

146
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,520
Are you really planning on...

147
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,580
telling Shi Meng
about your illness?

148
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,320
Can he accept it?

149
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,960
Will he believe you?

150
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,510
You're not home yesterday.

151
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,770
Are you available tonight?

152
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,100
I want to let you listen
to a new song.

153
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,000
That's right.

154
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,240
Shi Yi sent me a message yesterday
and I forgot to reply.

155
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm sorry, Shi Yi.

156
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,040
I'm not free tonight.

157
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,920
I'm having dinner with Shi Meng.

158
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,230
Maybe next time.

159
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,320
Is that okay?

160
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Is that so?

161
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,200
Where are you two eating?

162
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,400
We haven't figured it out yet.

163
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,520
Do you have any good place
to recommend?

This place is not bad.

166

I go there all the time.

167
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,760
Then we'll go here.

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,080
I think it will be fine
to leave it for another day.

172
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
Mr Shi?

173
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,560
Shi Meng?

174
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,070
Please have a look.

175
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,360
Seems good.

176
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,010
How are you with Zuo Yao recently?

177
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,080
The two of us are...

178
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,740
I want to invite her
out for dinner.

179
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,710
Why would you do that?

180
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,110
I want to tell her that...

181
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,600
I will be taking care of
Fang Yan from now on.

182
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,160
It feels weird.

183
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,280
If only Zuo Yao is here.

184
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,280
She can help me pick out an outfit.

185
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,760
Why is your mouth...

186
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,600
always faster than your brain?

187
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,250
-Well, I...
-These clothes are not nice,

188
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,990
I don't want to
wear them anymore.

189
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,040
Yao Yao.

190
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,760
I'm sorry.

191
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,560
I didn’t mean what I said earlier.

192
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,960
Can you forgive me?

193
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,840
That's not it.

194
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,160
It was my fault.

195
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,200
I was too emotional.

196
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,590
I just want the best for you.

197
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,880
I know.

198
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,160
Yao Yao.

199
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,880
You are the nicest person

200
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,480
to me besides Mom and Dad.

201
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,880
I'm so sorry.

202
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,760
I shouldn't have imposed
my own view of love on you.

203
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,480
Not to mention,

204
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,730
I don't even know Shi Meng personally.

205
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,840
Actually,

206
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,280
if you get to know him,

207
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,280
you will understand.

208
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,540
He looks cold on the outside,
but is a warm-hearted person.

209
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,320
I'll believe you for now.

210
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,660
And I'll be happy for you too.

211
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,200
-Really?
-But...

212
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,960
Don't be too content.

213
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,440
Let me tell you this.

214
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,920
Don't ever forget.

215
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,000
In a relationship,
you must protect yourself first.

216
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,480
If he loves you,
he will accept all of you.

217
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,230
Including your illness.

218
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,360
I...

219
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,720
Believe in him.

220
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,119
Look at your love-struck face.

221
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,319
Is it that obvious?

222
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,920
Very obvious.

223
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,890
Help me pick out
an outfit to wear.

224
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,670
I can't seem to choose one that suits me.

225
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,599
I thought you're already prepared?
There’re so many clothes.

226
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,480
What's wrong? You suitcase is still here.
You haven't unpacked?

227
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,280
I have to move back anyway.

228
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,440
So there's no need to unpack.

229
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,840
Have I tried this one?

230
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,960
Let me have a look.

231
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,340
This will make you look
thinner and taller.

232
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,400
This doesn’t work. I just tried it.
It looks weird.

233
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,600
This one makes you fluffy.

234
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,340
There's a little rabbit.

235
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,440
Suitable for someone who is love-struck.

236
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,800
I think so too.

237
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,880
Great.

238
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,080
Looks good.

239
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,400
[Jazz bar]

240
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,680
Shi Meng.

241
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,200
There is a saying.

242
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,240
But I'm not sure when to say it.

243
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,970
But it doesn't matter.

244
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,160
Why does it sound like a period drama?

245
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,960
This is too awkward.

246
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,520
Shi Meng.

247
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,680
Actually my illness...

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,900
is just a little bit on the serious side

249
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,870
but don't you worry,
when it happens,

250
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,440
I just need to be held
by Shi Yi in his arms.

251
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,560
But I think this...

252
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,440
What nonsense am I spouting?

253
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,770
I'm parking my car.
Will be there soon.

254
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,320
How do I explain this?

255
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,960
Right, I understand.

256
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,280
Pretty lady, are you okay?

257
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,200
Okay. I get it.

258
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,760
What's with you?

259
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,150
What's wrong with her?

260
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,150
You must be drunk.

261
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,560
Let go.

262
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,630
Why are you taking advantage of people?

263
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,960
What's with you?
Let go!

264
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,080
Let go!

265
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,540
What's with all of you?

266
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,640
Fang Yan.

267
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,840
Fang Yan.

268
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
Fang Yan.

269
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,560
What are you trying to do?

270
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,880
Give her to me.

271
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,360
Only I can help her.

272
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,300
Don't meddle.
Just leave her to me.

273
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,440
Leave her to you?

274
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,960
Shi Meng, just let Shi Yi handle it.

275
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,150
Fang Yan can only calm down
when she's with Shi Yi.

276
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,350
Don't be anxious,
just wait for a while.

277
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,300
If you care about her safety,

278
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,520
hand her over.

279
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,840
Right over here.

280
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,200
Call me if you need anything.

281
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,800
You're awake.

282
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,200
Why am I here?

283
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,780
You were unconscious.

284
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,260
Don't worry,
I haven't told Shi Meng anything.

285
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,320
I just told him

286
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,860
that you blacked out.

287
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,640
But...

288
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,480
why did I have a sudden relapse?

289
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,760
I didn't see anything that scared me.

290
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,960
Maybe...

291
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,440
you're too shocked,

292
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,560
so you forgot.

293
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,960
This time is different from before.

294
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,040
It feels as though I am asleep.

295
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,440
And then I kept hearing someone
whispering to me...

296
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,800
"move forward".

297
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,060
Anyway, thank you.

298
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,720
I have troubled you once again.

299
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
It's fine.

300
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
Rest well.

301
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,240
Shi Meng and I will go
and say hi to the owner.

302
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,650
Thank him for preparing
this place for us.

303
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,800
Why did I have a sudden relapse?

304
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,740
Did you know that Fang Yan is sick?

305
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
I know.

306
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
Vertigo.

307
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,930
It's actually sleepwalking.

308
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,920
What?

309
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,840
Psychogenic sleepwalking can
make her sluggish anytime, anywhere.

310
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,240
It makes her swoon
and lose consciousness.

311
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,280
And only...

312
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,330
I am able to cure her illness.

313
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,030
Fang Yan initially came to me through you.

314
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,290
The thing she wants...

315
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,160
is also due to the illness.

316
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,280
We have a request.

317
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,560
Say it.

318
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,440
I need to see Shi Yi today.

319
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,480
Shi Meng.

320
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,840
Shi Meng.

321
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,360
What is it?

322
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,320
Actually, tonight

323
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,520
I have something to tell you.

324
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,440
Just tell me tomorrow.

325
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,180
You need to rest early today.

326
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,560
I'll give this to you.

327
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,640
Wear it.

328
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,880
It's cold.

329
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,440
Just go.

330
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,160
Bye.

331
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,800
Hello, Dr Cui.

332
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,140
I'll be looking for you tomorrow.

333
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,750
Pretty lady, are you okay?

334
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,160
Fang Yan.

335
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,320
Fang Yan.

336
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,040
Fang Yan.

337
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,120
I'm sorry.

338
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,800
It is true that Fang Yan has sleepwalking.

339
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,760
Also,

340
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,210
only Shi Yi can handle her
when she's sick.

341
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,560
Shi Meng, just leave her to Shi Yi.

342
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,410
Fang Yan can only calm down
when she's with Shi Yi.

343
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,250
Fang Yan initially came to me through you.

344
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,510
The thing she wants...

345
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,530
is also due to the illness.

346
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,760
You wouldn't want her
to suffer in illness, right?

347
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,170
Shi Meng, don't forget about the movie
this afternoon.

348
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,440
I heard this movie is really good.

349
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,480
The score is 7.8.

350
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,760
This time,

351
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,000
should I tell him

352
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,720
the truth about my illness?

353
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,200
Fang Yan.

354
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,400
Do you know how much
I love you?

355
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,290
What did you think about the movie?

356
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
What about you?

357
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,440
I think it's good.

358
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,840
The heroine leapt over time
and social classes,

359
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,370
desperately pursuing her love.

360
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,840
I think this is how a person

361
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,630
in pursuit of love
should look like.

362
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,560
It's touching.

363
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,520
Do you think it's worth it?

364
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,350
She's giving up everything else...

365
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,400
for romance.

366
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,300
I think it's worth it.

367
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,420
If it's me,

368
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,680
I too am willing
to give up my life.

369
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,890
I can disregard my safety...

370
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,600
to pursue my love.

371
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,160
What is it?

372
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,040
I met Dr Cui.

373
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,440
You don't have vertigo.

374
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,440
I'm sorry.

375
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,950
I didn’t mean to hide it.

376
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,760
I knew that I should have
told you sooner.

377
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,300
Is there a difference whether
you told sooner or later?

378
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,560
I...

379
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,200
All this time,

380
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,160
I didn’t know how to tell you this.

381
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,120
I just want to be with you.

382
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,040
You just wanted to be with me?

383
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,740
And how do you plan
to treat your illness?

384
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,680
I don't need treatment.

385
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,800
I just need to be with you.

386
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,280
I don't need treatment.

387
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,800
You should already know this.

388
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,130
She is someone who is willing
to give up everything for love.

389
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,600
Shi Meng.

390
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,120
Happy birthday.

391
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,400
Shi Meng.

392
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,560
Wake up.

393
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,160
I like you.

394
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,440
Hand her over to me.

395
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,000
Only I can help her.

396
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,810
She will not accept...

397
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,720
this method of treatment.

398
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,520
This is what you call...

399
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,390
sacrificing in the name of love?

400
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,360
Aren't you too naive?

401
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,840
Thank you for everything
all this while.

402
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,680
But I don't need it.

403
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm sorry.

404
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,550
This is the only way...

405
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,040
you can be treated in peace.
