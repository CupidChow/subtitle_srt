[be saved by her destined prince.]

169
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,520
[My destined one,]

170
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,380
[will he ever show up?]

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,920
Fang Yan, wait for me here.
I'll get an umbrella.

172
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,760
Don't move.

173
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
[Sometimes,]

174
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,540
[I think I'm just like Sleeping Beauty,]

175
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,960
[I am also cursed.]

176
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,880
[I long for a prince to show up,]

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,840
[and tell me...]

179
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,680
[that what I went through
for more than ten years...]

180
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,280
[was just a nightmare.]

181
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,810
How could you leave her here alone?

182
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,160
Sorry, I went to get an umbrella.

183
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,030
Let's go.

184
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
-Let's go.
-Open the door.

185
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Okay.

186
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,000
-Easy.
-Easy.

187
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,690
The last sleepwalking episode
lasted longer than usual.

188
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,590
I think...

189
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,000
the conventional treatment
will not work anymore.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,920
I have tried medication and psychotherapy.

191
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,340
Do you have other treatment methods?

192
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,640
Recently,

193
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,480
Psychological Science magazine...

194
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
published a sleepwalking case.

195
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,810
It is identical to your condition.

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,520
It's also somnambulism
due to psychological reasons.

197
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,280
A patient with somnambulism
caused by long-term insomnia...

198
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,720
had received treatments in many hospitals
but to no avail,

199
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,980
until she met someone.

200
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,840
She could fall sound asleep
beside this person.

201
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,440
She eventually recovered
from somnambulism.

202
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,540
This person...

203
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,080
was her first love.

204
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,480
It is possible that
dopamine which love produces...

205
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,400
suppresses the fear in her subconscious,

206
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
gives her a great sense of security
and satisfaction.

207
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,760
So,

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,560
you too, need to fall in love.

209
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,410
Find someone who can give you
a sense of security.

210
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,360
Perhaps,

211
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,250
your illness will be cured.

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,730
How can you find true love
if you only stay at home?

213
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,920
I got to take you out and try your luck.

214
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,580
What are you doing
with that stupid compass?

215
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,400
We can at least find a direction.

216
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,570
We've driven for three rounds.

217
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,720
Do you really think...

218
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,880
you can find true love on the street?

219
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,000
You're right.

220
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,520
Why are we riding the car?

221
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,680
Shouldn't we go somewhere crowded
with many hot guys?

222
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,760
Where should we go?

223
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,640
Yao Yao,

224
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,320
can you please spare me?

225
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,440
I have a lot of dubbing projects to do.

226
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,400
The clients are rushing me. Let's go back.

227
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,080
No way. Today I closed
my record store for you.

228
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,760
I will never give up
until I find your true love.

229
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,040

230
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,160
No way.

231
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,790
I've given my chance...

232
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,480
to join The Tale of Water Utopia

233

234
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,720

235
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Of course.

236
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,490
Even Shi Yi the superstar
will go to support them.

it means we're not fated to meet.

this is just a press conference,

but it is quite a spectacle.

298
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,600
I guess the money which I asked...

299
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,360
wouldn't make much difference
for this movie.

You should take inflation
into consideration.

Isn't this Shi Yi?

510

Fang Yan was held by Shi Yi,

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,680
and then she recovered.

-Exactly.

if he needs a voice actor for his movie.

-That makes sense.

Yes.
