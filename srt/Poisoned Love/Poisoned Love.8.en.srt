[Episode 8]

4
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,150
I can explain.

5
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,080
I don't mean it.
When I was cleaning the house,

6
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,009
I noticed that the door is wide open.

7
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,920
Then, I saw that the feather of Goo Se
in the room.

8
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,000
So, I came in to clean up the room.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,479
In the course of cleaning,
I realised that the shelf has broken.

10
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,330
I worried that it might hurt someone else,
so I threw it away.

11
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,160
Where is the shelf?

12
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,670
Shelf? Please calm down.

13
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,280
I have got a new shelf online for you.

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,140
-It will reach two days later.
-I asked, where is it?

15
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,920
The thing?

16
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,720
Where is it?

17

Is this management office?

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,079
I am calling from number 14
of Tianbei New Area.

21
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,940
Did you see a shelf in the morning?

22
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,850
Yes, that is the one.

23
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,360
It's taken away by someone?

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,800
Okay, can I have the phone number
of the recycle centre?

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,730
Sure, thank you.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,260
Hello, Mum. Anything?

27
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,360
Okay, I got it.

28
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,280
Wait for me.

29
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,040

Sister-in-law.

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,160
Why are you crying non-stop?

32

Jian Hua will feel worried
if he saw you crying.

33
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,620
I am glad that you came.

34
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,840
Have some tea.

35
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,440
Go.

36
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,710
Look at Fang Qing.

37
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,600
Her husband went missing
for over 20 years.

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,720
Now, she simply holds a funeral for
her husband and pretends that he is dead.

39
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
It is understandable.

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,160
However, the funeral
appears more like a banquet.

41
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,860
It's too celebratory.

42
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,080
You have no idea
how Shi went missing right?

43
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,560
I heard that Xiao Meng went wild...

44
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,760
and he didn't go home on time.
Shi went missing while looking for him.

45
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,920
He went missing when
he was looking for Xiao Meng?

46
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,800
Also,

47
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
Xiao Meng...

48
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
When it happened,

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,920
Xiao Meng was too afraid
of being held liable,

50
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,779
he lied that...

51
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,440
he was brought out by Xiao Yi.

52
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,850
Both of them had a huge row
because of that.

53
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,500
That's why their relationship turned sour.

54
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,900
I didn't know about that.

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,550
I think it's time to end this.

57
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,640
Yes.

58
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,850
Only by doing so,

59
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,010
my mum will let it go.

60
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,460
After the funeral,

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,860
you should make peace with your brother.

62

Here, bid your father goodbye.

All of our relatives are here.

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,860
Have you discussed with me
before making the decision?

73
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,550
Xiao Meng.

74
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,530
I am sorry.

75

To me, he is still alive.

82

I don't wish that one day soon,
when he comes home,

hanging on the wall!

but it is the truth.

90
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,290
You have to accept it sooner or later.

91
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,090
Truth?

92
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,670
What truth?

93
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,440
Can any one of you prove that
he has passed away?

94
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,780

95

Please don't tell me you are referring to
Shi Meng, the devil.

174
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,350
Today, I...

175
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,550
Forget about it.

176
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,200
I need to use the ladies.
Please hold it for me.

177
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,800
Okay, I shall wait for you.

178
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,670
Okay.

179
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,510
Are you Fang Yan?

180
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,130
You are the voice actress
for the Lake God.

181
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,680
Yes.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,920
You are...

183
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,660
I am the assistant of Ms Lin Lin.

184
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,590
We are going to work together soon.

185
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Looking forward to working with you.

186
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,940
Looking forward to working with you.

187
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,910
If there is nothing else,
I am leaving.

188
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,710
Bye.

189
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,640
Are you okay?

190
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't know why...

191
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,640
but I have stomachache
out of a sudden.

192
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,500
However, Ms Lin Lin told me
to get her peach-wood sword...

193
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,720
from the prop room.

194
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,000
What can I do to help?

195
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,790
I am fine.

196
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,830
I just worry that if I hold up the time,

197
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,430
Ms Lin Lin might get mad at me.

198
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,490
How about this?

199
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,480
Let me get the sword for you.

200
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,910
You can take a break in the ladies.
What do you think?

201
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,110
Thank you so much.

202
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,320
Thank you.

203
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,310
You are welcome.

204
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,470
I will go get the sword for you now.

205
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,350
Take a rest here.

206
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,230
I shall go now.

207
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,830
Peach-wood sword?

208
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,340
Peach-wood sword.

209
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,270
Peach-wood sword.

210
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,390
Fang Yan!

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,480
Fang Yan!

212
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,890
Fang Yan, are you okay?

213
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,770
Stop staring! Leave the scene.

214
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Why is the scarf not working?

215
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,370
Come here. Let me call Shi Yi.

216
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,570
Here, let me help you.

217
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,600
Is she okay?

218
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,400
She is like that.

219
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,780
It's fun, isn't it?

220
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,440
Hello.

221
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,900
Hello, Shi Yi.

222
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,920
Your scarf is not working.
Come to office now.

223
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,080
Fang Yan has fallen ill again.

224
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Why did  she fall ill all of a sudden?l

225
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,120
Wait for me. I will be there soon.

226
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,920
[Sure, I will be waiting for you.]
[Hurry up!]

227
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
Fang Yan!

228
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,700
Why does she fall ill out of a sudden?

229
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,380
-Fang Yan.
-What happened to her?

230
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,870
It's a relapse.

231
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,560
Fang Yan!

232
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
Fang Yan!

233
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,680
Fang Yan!

234
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,590
Did she have a shock again?

235
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,640
Don't worry.

236
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,450
She just has to stay quiet for a while.

237
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,380
She will be fine.

238
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,870
Go to my office.

239
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,040
Here.

240
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,320
Bring her up.

241
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,160
Why isn't Shi Yi here?

242
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,240
Hello?

243
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,690
Shi Yi, where are you?

244
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
Slow down.

245
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,880
Slow down.

246
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
[CEO Office]

247
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,360
Slow down.

248
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,720
Fang Yan.

249
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
What took him so long?

250
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Fang Yan!

251
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,860
Why is she still unconscious?

252
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Let's wait a bit.
She will be fine soon.

253
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,560
Fang Yan!

254
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,620
Why isn't Shi Yi here yet?

255
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,080
Fang Yan!

256
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,640
We can't wait any longer.
Send her to the hospital.

257
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,570
Shi Meng, she needs not to go to hospital.

258
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,650
-Fang Yan!
-Finally you are here, Shi Yi.

259
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,580
I was so nervous!

260
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,400
Fang Yan.

261
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,940
What are you doing?

262
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,560
Stay out of it. Leave her to me.

263
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,490
Leave her to you?

264
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,600
Shi Meng, just leave her to Shi Yi.

265
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,360
Don't misunderstand.

266
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,560
Fang Yan is at ease
when she is around Shi Yi.

267
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,160
Calm down. Just wait and see.

268
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,840
[Hello, are you there?]

269
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,640
Yes.

270
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,640
-Hello, doctor.
-Why does it take so long?

271
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,680
She fainted out of a sudden.

272
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,410
She has the history of vertigo.

273
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,730
Why hasn't she regained consciousness?

274
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,880
Has her condition worsened?

275
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,120
I have no idea. Dr Cui...

276
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,250
only mentioned about intimacy.
Perhaps she needs more than just hugging.

277
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,710
Fang Yan!

278
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,840
My goodness, finally you are awake.

279
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,300
You gave me a deadly shock.

280
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,150
Finally, you are awake.

281
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,630
I am glad that you are awake.

282
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,310
Why is Shi Yi here?

283
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,360
It's over.

284
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,440
It's over.

285
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,220
Did I have a relapse again?

286
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,200
It's okay.

287
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,720
Shi Meng,

288
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,590
we should settle...

289
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,570
our conflicts in private.

290
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,570
We don't have to do it in front of Mum.

291
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,880
Got it.

292
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,400
However, with regard
to our dad's whereabouts,

293
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,460
I will look into it.

294
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,530
Got it.

295
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,450
I support your decision.

296
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,440
However, the investigation...

297
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,040
must not be made known to Mum.

298
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,530
Do you really think that Mum...

299
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,990
is the kind of person
who smiles all the time?

300
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,520
Didn't you see her cry today?

301
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,589
For countless nights,

302
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,160
mum stayed in her room...

303
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,819
and cried in secret...

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
while holding dad's stuffs.

305
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,280
I saw her...

306
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:11,960
borne all the suffering...

307
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,290
by herself.

308
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,150
Okay.

309
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:19,650
I promise.

310
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,750
Did Shi Yi wake me up by kissing me?

311
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,089
I am doomed.

312
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,890
My illness is getting
harder and harder to cure.

313
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,710
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

314
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,690
You didn't see...

315
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,290
Shi Yi's facial expression.

316
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,570
He would rather be the patient
if he could.

317
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,750
What are we doing in Shi Meng's office?

318
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,510
Was he here when Shi Yi kissed me?

319
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,850
You are concerned about her.

320
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,220
Yes.

321
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,720
She is my roommate.

322
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,310
We stay together.

323
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,930
So what if I care about her?

324
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,100
That silly girl.

325
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,760
She thought she can approach me...

326
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,840
just by doing so.

327
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,450
Both of you are a couple now?

328
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,490
We will become a couple soon.

329
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,670
It's so unlike you.

330
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,260
That's because I didn't meet anyone...

331
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,920
whom I want to protect before.

332
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,040
Protect?

333
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,060
You never care about...

334
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,590
things that are none of
your business, right?

335
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,340
I don't care about anyone else.

336
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,250
But to me,

337
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,130
Fang Yan...

338
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,060
is very important.

339
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,250
Stop thinking too much. Let's go.

340
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,710
You should go home to rest.

341
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,640
How do you feel?

342
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,860
Do you need a rest?

343
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,000
I feel so much better.

344
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,970
Thank you for your help.

345
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,040
How about this?

346
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,520
Let's go for a stroll.

347
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,060
Go with him.

348
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,320
Sure.

349
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,760
Let's go.

350
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,250
Sure, I am leaving.

351
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,760
So this is...

352
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,920
how a celebrity cools himself down.

353
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,470
What is wrong?

354
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,770
You don't like it?

355
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,810
No.

356
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,340
I am surprised that big-shot celebrity
can be so down to earth.

357
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,130
Whenever I am under stress,

358
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
or when I am upset,

359
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,710
I will come here alone.

360
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,360
What happened to your mouth?

361
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,020
I was just thinking that even Shi Meng...

362
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,720
Both of you came back together.

363
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,050
Let's not talk about it.

364
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,240
Let's sing.

365
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,160
Sure.

366
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,130
Let me show you...

367
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,320
how I deal with stress...

368
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,560
on a frequent basis.

369
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,330
The secret lies in this song.

370
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,250
I hope that I can perform the song...

371
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,040
together with Mr Shi Yi.

372
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,680
♫ I woke up in the morning ♫

373
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,060
♫ I am still sleepy
and my eyes are in a blur ♫

374
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,230
♫ I suddenly remember ♫

375
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,630
♫ Today is a holiday ♫

376
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,880
♫ I called Ms Chen and asked for a date ♫

377
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,550
♫ We agreed to meet up at garden ♫

378
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,150
♫ Who knows that I was wearing a shirt ♫

379
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,080
♫ I wore the right shoe on my left foot ♫

380
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,760
It's to relax yourself!

381
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,960
♫ I went to the garden in a rush ♫

382
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,310
♫ She was already there ♫

383
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,910
♫ Her face was even prettier than flower ♫

384
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,840
♫ I did my best to win her heart ♫

385
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,550
♫ I gave her a hug right away ♫

386
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,790
Stop fighting!

387
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,630
If your dad were here,

388
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,360
he wouldn't wish to see this scene.

389
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,080
What do you think?
Don't you think that your worries...

390
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,000
have been blown away,

391
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,460
just like the dark clouds?

392
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,170
You always surprise me, Yin Jiang.

393
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
In that case,

394
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,770
Big-shot celebrity,

395
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,770
don't you think you should sing a song?

396
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,690
Me?

397
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,440
I know what song you should sing.

398
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,350
Wait for it.

399
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,440
Please.

400
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,000
What happened?

401
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,690
You drink after working hours...

402
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,490
without me.

403
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,960
You are not a good friend.

404
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,810
If you are troubled,

405
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,070
you should not drink on an empty stomach.

406
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,010
It is bad for your health.

407
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,290
You have to say something even if
you are not supposed to say it.

408
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,320
Both of you are grown up now.

409
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,560
Why did you fight with him?

410
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,600
Isn't that childish?

411
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
I am just kidding.

412
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,370
Here.

413
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,390
I, Hao Ying Jun...

414
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,220
might be playful all the time...

415
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,010
but I know...

416
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,700
some absolute truths.

417
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,120
When people are confronted with problems,

418
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,370
some people...

419
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,480
have the habit of looking ahead...

420
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,000
while some people...

421
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,760
have the habit of keeping it
to themselves.

422
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,830
I know you well.

423
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,770
You are a macho man.

424
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,210
Unlike me,

425
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,360
you don't nag.

426
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,610
Am I right?

427
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,750
You prefer to keep things to yourself.

428
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,280
However, the longer you do so,

429
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,680
the more hurtful you get.

430
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,190
Those who have the habit of moving on...

431
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,430
it doesn't mean that they forget everything.

432
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,390
Do you agree?

433
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,670
Here.

434
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,120
Were you sent by my mum?

435
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,430
See?

436
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,270
No mother in the world...

437
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,550
will get mad at her own son for real.

438
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,610
Do you agree?

439
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,350
Shi Meng, I think...

440
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,770
you are better than me in every aspect.

441
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,270
However, you are inferior to me
for only one thing.

442
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,110
You never admit your mistakes.

443
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,730
If you ask me,

444
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,990
admitting a mistake...

445
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,540
in front of those whom you love...

446
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,750
is not a big deal.

447
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,600
Admitting a mistake?

448
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,390
It happens when you are not confident
with your decision.

449
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,290
Just pretend that I didn't say anything.

450
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,930
Teach me.

451
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,770
That is right.

452
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,280
Here.

453
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,740
When it comes to admitting mistake,

454
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,390
there are many hidden details.

455
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
Slow down.

456
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,070
Don't you dare get drunk...

457
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,380
before I finish talking.

458
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,580
I will leave you behind
if you get drunk.

459
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,800
Admitting a mistake...

460
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,800
is a survival skill which
I have mastered since young.

461
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,490
You don't have to send me off.
Someone might recognise you.

462
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,870
It's okay. There are not
many people anyway.

463
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,640
The song that you sang
was full of stories.

464
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,990
Can you tell me about it?

465
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,200
Of course, you don't have to tell me.

466
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,530
I am just asking for fun.

467
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,530
I wrote this song...

468
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,160
because I heard a story
about two siblings.

469
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,710
They were very close initially.

470
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,180
On the eighth birthday
of the younger brother,

471
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,110
the younger brother went missing.

472
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,740
While looking for
the younger brother, their dad...

473
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,940
went missing and never came back again.

474
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,890
The siblings who lost their father...

475
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,080
started to blame each other.

476
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,120
The elder brother said...

477
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,720
it's because the younger brother
wandered around...

478
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,850
and caused their father to go missing.

479
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,800
The younger brother claimed that...

480
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,460
his elder brother left him behind
on purpose...

481
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,260
and that's why he lost his way.

482
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,150
Since then,

483
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,270
the siblings argue non-stop.

484
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,650
They were no longer as close as before.

485
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,470
[So...]

486
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,700
[this is the story
between him and his brother.]

487
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,800
If...

488
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,030
one of the siblings lies,

489
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,540
who do you think the liar is?

490
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,580
I think it doesn't matter...

491
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,780
who the liar is.

492
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,160
The more important thing is...

493
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,290
neither of the siblings can afford...

494
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,560
the consequences.

495
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,340
Furthermore,

496
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,780
I think the liar...

497
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,180
bears the greater burden.

498
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,730
Watch out!

499
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
Well...

500
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,070
Thank you.

501
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,730
Well...

502
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,290
I am almost home.

503
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,020
I shall make a move.

504
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,800
You...

505
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,120
Why do you live with Shi Meng?

506
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,920
It's a long story.

507
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,350
However, I will move out soon.

508
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,460
Can you please lend me your phone?

509
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,720
Your phone.

510
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,600
If you have a relapse again,

511
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,810
[Shi Yi]

512
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,010
contact me immediately.

513
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,490
I am just a phone call away.

514
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,360
You don't have to thank me.

515
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,760
You need to record a song for me.

516
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Just take it as...

517
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,180
reward.

518
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,520
Go home, I shall watch you go.

519
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,960
Good night.

520
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,350
Thank you for your help.

521
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,520
No problem.

522
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,750
It's just a song.

523
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,170
Thank you for treating my illness.

524
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,580
I am going home.

525
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,730
-Bye!
-Bye!

526
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,730
My goodness, how much alcohol\ndid he drink?

527
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,960
He stinks!

528
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,990
Mr Shi.

529
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,460
Mr Shi.

530
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,260
Mr Shi!

531
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,770
Wake up!

532
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,340
It's time to work!

533
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,580
Are you awake? Wake up!

534
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,140
One, two...

535
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,500
Three!

536
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,070
Are you fully awake?

537
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,100
Swallow it back!

538
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,690
Okay, let's go.

539
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,410
Time to sleep. Let's go.

540
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,370
Time to sleep.

541
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,220
You are as heavy as a dead pig.

542
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,520
What are you doing?

543
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,440
It's dirty.

544
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,910
Dirty?

545
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,050
Where?

546
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,650
Let go of me!

547
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,210
What are you doing?

548
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,210
I feel hot.

549
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,020
You shouldn't take off your clothes
even if you feel warm.

550
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,900
Worse, you do it in front of a girl!

551
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,420
I want it.
