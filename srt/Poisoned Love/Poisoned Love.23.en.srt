[Poisoned Love]

3
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,800
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,800
OK.

5
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,479
Let's proceed to the second session.

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,960
Bride and groom, please
wear the rings for each other.

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,800
Shi Meng is not here yet.
Quickly go over.

8
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,440
Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,680
let's take a short break...

10
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,800
before the second session.

11
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
This...

12
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,190
Why we need to take a break?

13
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,160
Because I want to perform for all of you.

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,640
Yes.

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,960
A small...

16
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,200
Something like...

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,560
The thing that Zuo You
loves the most in this world...

18
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,400
is Cola.

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,760
And the thing that I love
the most in this world...

20
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,880
is you, Zuo Yao.

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,640
OK.

22
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,490
Zuo Yao,

23
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,640
marry me.

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,610
It seems that this gentleman
is quite excited.

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,960
His emotions must have been affected
by the romantic atmosphere here.

26
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,079
Sorry, everybody.

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
We still should know...

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
who are the main characters today.

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,040
I hope all of you can
give attention and applaud...

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,960
for our bride and groom, OK?

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,080
-OK.
-OK.

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
[I believe...]

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,640
[Shi Meng will definitely come.]

34
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,280
[If...]

35
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,280
[Shi Meng didn't appear in the end,]

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,320
[can you act with me until the end?]

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,120
Fang Yan...

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,120
-Fang Yan...
-She fell sick?

39
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,880
How come she acts weirdly?

40
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,360
I think she's sick.

41
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,160
Be careful!

42
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
[I knew that...]

43
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,440
[you'll definitely come.]

44
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,200
[She's really a drama queen.]

45
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,760
[She looked as if she was really sick.]

46
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,520
Shi Meng, stop there!

47
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,880
You still want to act?

48
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
This drama...

49
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
should end here.

50
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,200
[I'm sorry, Fang Yan.]

51
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,920
[Please forgive me that
I couldn't explain it to you now.]

52
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,360
[Please give me more time.]

53
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,040
[You'll understand
everything eventually.]

54
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,360
Shi Meng,

55
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
Actually, I...

57
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,920
We just want you to appear.

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
It was the plan of Shi Yi and I.

59
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,040
You won't be angry, right?

60
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,800
Stand up.

61
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,240
Silly girl,

62
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,880
how can I be angry?

63
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,960
Actually, it's all my fault.

64
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,840
I shouldn't have made you worry.

65
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,040
I should have accompanied you.

66
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,310
It's OK.

67
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,680
The most important thing is...

68
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,480
you're here.

69
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,600
You don't have to worry.

70
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,200
I will settle the company matter.

71
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,320
I'm not worried.

72
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,840
I think all these difficulties
that we're facing now...

73
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,640
are a challenge for us.

74
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,680
As your wife,

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,200
I have to always be with you.

76
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,640
We're sharing each other's fortunes.

77
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,400
Of course we have to share
each other's burdens too.

78
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,560
No need.

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,560
I won't let you be in hardship anymore.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,520
You look down on me?

81
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,320
-No.
-Let me tell you.

82
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm very sincere in our relationship.

83
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,280
From today onwards,

84
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,840
I'll live...

85
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,040
a frugal life with you.

86
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,080
Then, let's eat hotpot together?

87
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,320
It is a waste of money.

88
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,440
Why do we need to eat hotpot?

89
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
We'll go to the wet market.

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,840
Wet market?

91
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,440
Yes, let's go to the wet market.

92
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,400
I have to calculate our budget...

93
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,840
-and decide what to buy.
-Wet...

94
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,360
Your frugal life is to
come to the wet market?

95
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
You'll not need to pay much
more if you order a delivery.

96
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,840
Even a small amount makes a difference.

97
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,000
Not only we can save money,

98
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,400
we can experience life too.

99
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,640
We can kill three birds with one stone.

100
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,440
Of course it is more worthy to
do this than ordering food online.

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,400
I'll listen to you in future.

102
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
No, I'll listen to you when
it comes to big matter.

103
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,640
There's no big matter in future.

104
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,160
OK.

105
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
Brother, can you give me
a few more pieces?

106
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,080
I've bought so many vegetables, right?

107
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,600
This guy is really handsome.

108
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,080
He looks so good when he smiles.

109
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
Thank you.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,840
Sister,

111
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,930
if I ask him to smile one more time,

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
can you give me a few
more pieces of vegetables?

113
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,720
Smile.

114
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,200
OK, I'll give it to you.

115
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,760
Sister, you're so kind.

116
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,880
I wish you a prosperous business.

117
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,039
What is that?

118
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,400
This is goose meat.

119
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,559
-Goose?
-Goose?

120
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,480
-No.
-Let's go.

121
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,679
-Let's go.
-Goo Se...

122
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,600
Let's go. I'm sorry.

123
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
Goo Se...

124
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,760
Let's eat fish tonight.

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,640
OK.

126
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
Then, you buy the fish here,

127
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,400
and I'll buy the condiments.

128
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
Remember, we must...

129
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,080
-OK.
-We must save money!

130
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,960
OK.

131
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Boss,

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,880
give me a fish.

133
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,760
OK.

134
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,760
Which type do you want?

135
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,240
We have grass carp,

136
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
Crucian carp, yellow croaker,

137
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
and bighead carp. Which one do you want?

138
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,360
I want...

139
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,640
the one...

140
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,040
The one...

141
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,960
The cheapest one.

142
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
What?

143
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,470
Can you talk louder?

144
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,520
That kind.

145
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,960
You want those that can make you strong?

146
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,560
-No.
-OK, I know it.

147
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,680
I have terrapins here.

148
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,520
-This is definitely what you want.
-No.

149
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,440
You can make
your wife even more satisfied.

150
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
No, I said those...

151
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,240
Young man, don't be shy.

152
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,680
I understand you.

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,760
You want to restore your virility...

154
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,200
and be masculine again.

155
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,360
No, I know...

156
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,310
It's OK. I'll offer you a cheaper price.

157
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,520
I'll give it you. Take one.

158
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,400
I want the cheapest fish.

159
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,120
Please send it to Tianbei New Area,
the 14th building, number 2101.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,920
OK.

161
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,280
How is it?

162
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,000
-I've bought it.
-Did you follow my idea...

163
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,040
and use it on the spot?

164
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,160
-Yes.
-Really?

165
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,680
I've bought the cheapest fish
and it'll be delivered to our house.

166
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,960
Young man, do you
still want your terrapin?

167
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,920
Terrapin?

168
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,760
We can't buy fish anymore.

169
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,280
We've already replaced meat with tofu.

170
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,040
You still want
to buy "fake fish"(terrapin)?

171
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,240
It's OK as long as we don't get diarrhoea.

172
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,040
-Let's go.
-You're such a bad boss.

173
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,920
And you have better tactics than me.

174
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,520
Let's start.

175
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,440
How come it's only half a fish?

176
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,400
Didn't we buy a lot of food?

177
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,680
Young master,

178
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
now...

179
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,280
we have to split the food
of a meal into three meals.

180
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,560
This is called a frugal life.

181
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,960
Your life has become tough...

182
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,360
with me.

183
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,880
No.

184
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,640
The most important thing...

185
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,280
for a couple is companionship.

186
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,080
Nothing is more important than that.

187
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
I can...

188
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
support your life too.

189
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,920
You support my life?

190
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,240
You can continue to be a pretty boy.

191
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,120
I'll...

192
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,080
be responsible to earn
money and pay for our living.

193
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,560
It's quite true that...

194
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,760
it'll be hard for you...

195
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
if you have to be a pretty girl.

196
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,960
What did you say?
I'm a pretty girl Jiangnan.

197
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,240
If you don't like me,
it's you who is blind.

198
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,840
OK, I'm blind.

199
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,920
You're pretty.

200
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,040
You're the prettiest.

201
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Come, eat fish.

202
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Pretty girl from Jiangnan.

203
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,510
Pretty girl from Jiangnan
doesn't want to eat.

204
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
Then, I'll eat.

205
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,760
I'll take a bite of this.

206
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,520
Is it good?

207
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,880
It's good.

208
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,320
Good that it's tasty.

209
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Xiao Yi,

210
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,820
I heard that a lot of
people in the company...

211
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,600
are hoping Shi Meng to come back.

212
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,680
Looks like everyone likes him.

213
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,080
Since everyone likes him,

214
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,160
then we'll chase them away.

215
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,720
Xiao Yi,

216
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,600
don't be too jealous of your brother.

217
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,520
You're a real man. You should
know when to yield and when not.

218
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,080
Uncle Gu,

219
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,920
do you know what people
wrote about me on the internet?

220
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
They said I have embarrassed myself.

221
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,000
I should bury myself.

222
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,360
I'll continue to observe Shi Meng.

223
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,680
Xiao Yi,

224
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,280
I just took over
the position as a chairman.

225
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,920
It's not good for me to interfere
the financial side of things.

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,160
You take care of it for me.

227
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,040
We can take the opportunity
to settle Shi Meng's matter.

228
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
OK, Uncle Gu.

229
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,880
Don't worry.

230
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
I'll make him pay the price.

231
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,520
You're here.

232
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,240
Explain to me.

233
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,440
Why do you want to be engaged?

234
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,400
Why do you want to
involve Fang Yan in this?

235
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,440
Gu Yuan Zhou still doesn't trust me.

236
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,440
He doesn't allow me to interfere
in the company's financial matters.

237
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,840
Therefore,

238
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,480
I used this engagement to cheat him.

239
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,400
I hope he can trust me earlier.

240
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,240
[Nine days ago]

241
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,520
[Where are you?]

242
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,640
[I want to see you now.]

243
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
[OK, I'll come immediately.]

244
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,440
[What happened? You sounded urgent.]

245
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,680
[Do you still remember ]

246
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,480
[the incident which I was
kidnapped when I was a kid?]

247
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,440
[Fang Yan was the kid who
was kidnapped together with me.]

248
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,040
[This is the reason
why I can treat her illness.]

249
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,400
[So, you were really kidnapped
when you were a kid.]

250
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,640
[Is Fang Yan's illness...]

251
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,560
[related to the person
who kidnapped both of you?]

252
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,600
[She hid in a corner at that time.]

253
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,600
[Although she didn't see
the face of the kidnapper,]

254
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,320
[she heard the kidnapper...]

255
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,080
[arguing with a man.]

256
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,480
[Do you know who that man was?]

257
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,400
[Who was it?]

258
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,200
[The man...]

259
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,640
[was there to look for me.]

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,240
[He called the kidnapper...]

261
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
[as Xiao Liu.]

262
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,960
[Xiao Liu?]

263
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,280
[Uncle Liu?]

264
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,200
[Isn't that the nickname
of Gu Yuan Zhou?]

265
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,280
[And only Dad called him that nickname.]

266
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,160
[Could it be that...]

267
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,680
[the kidnapper was Gu Yuan Zhou...]

268
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,760
[and the person who
looked for you was Dad?]

269
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,520
[According to Fang Yan,]

270
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,560
[the reason they argued...]

271
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,360
[was because of a financial report.]

272
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,800
[Financial report?]

273
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,400
[Could it be that Dad
disappeared because of this?]

274
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,280
[I'm just guessing now.]

275
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,560
[We still need evidence...

276
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,800
[to expose the truth.]

277
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,640
[Gu Yuan Zhou...]

278
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,760
[Financial report.]

279
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,520
[Let's not talk about this first.]

280
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,640
[Gu Yuan Zhou looked for you earlier?]

281
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,000
[Yes.]

282
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,280
[He looked for me to discuss about matters
related to the board of directors.]

283
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,840
[He really gave up on me.]

284
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,120
[The company is in the midst of
changing board of directors now.]

285
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
[You're the easiest person
to get a position.]

286
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,560
[How about this?]

287
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
[Are you willing...]

288
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,240
[to act with me during
the board of directors' meeting?]

289
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,160
[I would like to nominate
Mr Gu Yuan Zhou...]

290
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
[as the new director of Concept Pictures.]

291
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,600
[You are the one who
chased Shi Meng away.]

292
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,440
[If I tell you now that...]

293
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,840
[I have my own reasons.]

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,240
[Would you believe me?]

295
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,400
[Now is the time that
Shi Meng needs me the most.]

296
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,400
[I need to find him.]

297
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,680
[If I tell you now that...]

298
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,920
[I have a way...]

299
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,960
[that can help you to find Shi Meng,]

300
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,600
[are you willing to cooperate with me?]

301
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,760
You didn't see Fang Yan's sad face...

302
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,960
when she was trying to find you.

303
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,360
You have to go back
to her sooner or later.

304
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,960
I know you won't promise me this.

305
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,840
That's why I act...

306
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,400
without discussing things with you.

307
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,320
Now that this has past,
let's not mention anymore.

308
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,400
We shouldn't involve her
in this in the future.

309
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,320
OK.

310
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,440
I'll promise you.

311
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,920
Oh yes.

312
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,200
Look at this.

313
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,880
20 years ago,

314
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,440
Gu Yuan Zhou really did some
dirty tricks to the company's financial.

315
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
It turns out to be...

316
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,880
the reason he kidnapped me then...

317
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,240
was to threaten Dad...

318
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,960
and forced Dad to handover
the evidence of his crime.

319
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,000
The possibility is high.

320
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,440
Because only Dad and Gu Yuan Zhou...

321
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,319
know about this incident.

322
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,960
If it's really like that,

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,760
then I know now what I should do next .

324
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,920
Let me tell you,

325
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,290
actually I was really
angry about Shi Yi last time.

326
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,560
He threw the egg.

327
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,710
Do you know that the son of Goo Se...

328
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,280
had gone through so many
hardships in order to survive?

329
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,440
If it's like what you said,

330
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
then he's really bad.

331
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,000
Not only he's really bad,
he's extremely bad.

332
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,600
And I watched the news just now.

333
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,320
The news reported that
Shi Yi has become a producer.

334
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
And he'll take over the production
of The Tale of Water Utopia.

335
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,720
Is Shi Yi's zodiac sign a rat?

336
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Why did he...

337
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,400
steal the fruits of your labour?

338
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,600
Then,

339
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,520
he's extremely bad.

340
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Moreover, he's heartless.

341
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,240
Yes.

342
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,360
Whatâ€™s wrong?

343
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,120
No.

344
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,760
You're a bit weird.

345
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Those words that you uttered don't
sound like words that'll come from you.

346
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,600
Really?

347
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,760
Then...

348
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
It's...

349
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,440
like this.

350
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,880
Regarding Shi Yi,

351
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,080
actually,

352
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,480
the impact on me...

353
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,280
is really huge.

354
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,840
It's OK.

355
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,720
It's OK.

356
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,370
Don't be sad.

357

Let bygones be bygones.

358
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,840
Although I can't protect you...

359
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,880
like I protect the son of my bird,

360
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
I'll be working very hard...

361
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,120
and use all my strength to protect you.

362
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,280

What's wrong, Uncle Gu?

375
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,960
Let's have a tea in your office.

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,010

Uncle Gu, I'll take a call first.

379
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
OK.

380
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,800
Hello, Mum.

What is it?

382
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,640
What?

383
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,680
Shi Meng used the kidnapping case
to make an issue again?

384
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
I won't care anymore.

385
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,760
OK, I know.

386
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
Uncle Gu, let's go.

387
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,440
Let's go.

388
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,000
Xiao Yi,

389
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,400
you've seen just now
during the meeting, right?

390
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,600
Some old directors...

391
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,440
still support Shi Meng very much.

392
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,800
You have to build
good rapport with them...

393
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,120
[The Tale of Water Utopia]

394
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,560
to avoid Shi Meng making a comeback...

395
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,160
and defeat you without you knowing.

396
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,640
Uncle Gu, don't worry.

397
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,960
Shi Meng...

398
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,040
can't do anything big here.

399
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,440
What do you mean?

400
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
You knew it too.

401
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,720
Over the years,

402
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
Shi Meng has been avoiding the incident
which he caused the death of my dad.

403
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,600
He said that...

404
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,960
he didn't run away when he was a kid.

405
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,560
He was actually kidnapped.

406
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Is it?

407
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,560
Isn't that a lie by a kid?

408
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,920
Over the years,
nobody has ever cared about it.

409
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,600
Yes.

410
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,120
But lately,

411
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,240
he has been investigating
about that kidnapping case.

412
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
He said that...

413
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,720
he found new evidence
about the kidnapping case.

414
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,680
He said that there was a witness...

415
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,800
who saw my dad went into
the mountain back then.

416
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,480
He was holding a document folder.

417
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,800
Then, he went around
to look for evidence...

418
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,120
like a crazy man.

419
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Yes, it sounds crazy.

420
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,080
It has been 20 years, right?

421
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,440
That's why...

422
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,400
he won't care about the company.

423
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,880
Don't worry.

424
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,560

428
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,200
I think he fell into our trap.

429
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,560

Looks like it. You cook something
so nutritious in the morning?

439
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,320

we need this pig trotters soup...

00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,510
Shi Meng will be proposing to you...

504
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
and I almost die because of your torture.

505
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
This...

506
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,080
-is very pretty.
-Really?

507
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,400
-Perfect.
-Really?

508
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,400
Beautiful.

509
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,120
-This is it.
-Yes.

510
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,840
Thank you, Yao Yao.

511
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,120
Is Shi Meng back?

512
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,800
OK.

513
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Hurry up.

514
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,360
-Shi...
-Hi,

515
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,760
are you Ms Fang Yan?

516
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,800
Yes.

517
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,680
Your flowers.

518
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,680
Thank you.

519
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,040
You are welcome. Please sign here.

520
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Flowers?

521
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,480
Looks like Shi Meng finally...

522
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,040
knows how to be romantic.

523
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,560
"Five o'clock in the afternoon."

524
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,960
"I'll wait for you here."

525
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,360
[Five o'clock in the afternoon.
I'll wait for you here. Be sure to wait!]

526
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,440
"Be sure to wait!"

527
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,080
"I'll wait for you here."

528
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,320
Where is it?

529
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,200
-Where is it?
-What where is it? Take it.

530
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,800
Where are you going?

531
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,240
Shi Meng dated me
to our old dating place.

532
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
She's so anxious.

533
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,360
Old dating place?

534
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,040
Woman in love...

535
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,800
is scary.

536
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,880
[Are you confident?]

537
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,920
[Don't worry. He's suspecting that
the ledger is with me.]

538
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,680
[He'll definitely pay
attention to my whereabouts.]

539
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,160
[We just have to wait for him
to fall into our trap.]

540
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,560
It's really here.

541
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,640
[Looks like brother really
brought the ledger report here.]

542
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,960
Uncle Gu,

543
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,040
it's really you.

544
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,000
This ledger report...

545
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,760
is the evidence of
your financial deficit back then.

546
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,880
You kidnapped me because of this, right?

547
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,520
If your dad didn't force me
with it back then,

548
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,290
things would not be like this.

549
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,960
I guessed it correctly.

550
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,200
Back then,

551
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,130
your dad told me right here that...

552
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,120
he doesn't have the
evidence of my financial deficit.

553
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,040
[I kidnapped you and kept you here then.]

554
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,560
[Your dad promised me on the phone.]

555
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,760
[I waited for your dad
to bring the evidence here.]

556
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,920
[Xiao Liu.]

557
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,800
[Xiao Liu.]

558
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,200
[Xiao Liu, where is my son?]

559
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,920
[I've said it. You have to give me
the ledger record first.]

560
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,880
[I don't have the ledger record.]

561
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,400
[I don't plan to investigate...]

562
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,080
[about your financial deficit.]

563
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
[Xiao Liu,]

564
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,040
[you can't do something illegal again.]

565
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,800
[It's all my fault.]

566
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,330
[But, you are the cause
of everything today.]

567
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
[I don't want to say anything now.]

568
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,600
[If I can't get the ledger report,]

569
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,800
[you will never see your son again.]

570
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,320
[What did you do to my son?]

571
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,920
What did you do to my dad?

572
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,240
Where is my dad?

573
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,560
Since you want to know about it,

574
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,120
you ask him then

575
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,360
-Shi Yi.
-Shi Meng.

576
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,880
Are you alright?

577
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,960
Gu Yuan Zhou,

578
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,120
I've reported you to the police.

579
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,760
I've recorded everything that you said.

580
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,520
It turns out to be the brothers
turned against each other...

581
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,440
is the plan.

582
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,200
What a good plan.

583
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,400
Gu Yuan Zhou,

584
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,080
how did my dad die then?

585
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,880
Since both of you are so smart,

586
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,760
why don't you investigate it yourself?

587
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,200
The police are already on the way.

588
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,880
The truth will be
revealed sooner or later.

589
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,680
Both of you are really naive.

590
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
Give me the recording you made just now.

591
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,760
Let me go.

592
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,800
Maybe I can spare Fang Yan's life.

593
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,640
Fang Yan?

594
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,960
What did you do to Fang Yan?

595
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,760
[Shi Meng]

596
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,680
Fang Yan forgot to bring her phone.

597
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
[Shi Meng]

598
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Shi Meng?

599
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,960
Hello, Shi Meng.

600
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,160
Zuo Yao?

601
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,040
Where is Fang Yan?

602
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,880
Isn't she going out to look for you?

603
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
[She said you dated her to the
old dating place of both of you.]

604
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,880
Didn't you present her
the flowers and the card?

605
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Hello...

606
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,440
Gu Yuan Zhou,

607
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,880
where did you hide Fang Yan?

608
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,760
Tell me!

609
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,000
I'll spare her life if you
give me the recording.

610
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,040
Give it to him.

611
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,840
Give it to him!

612
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,440
Quickly tell us.

613
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,880
Fang Yan...

614
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,400
Quickly tell us.

615
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
Where is Fang Yan?

616
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,880
Don't move.

617
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,640
Gu Yuan Zhou,

618
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,520
where is Fang Yan?

619
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,760
Where is she now?

620
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,400
It's too late.
