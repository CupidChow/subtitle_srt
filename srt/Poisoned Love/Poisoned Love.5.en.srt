[Poisoned Love]

3
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,800
[Episode 5]

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,479
There was some misunderstandings
between us before...

5
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,680
because of that.

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
So...

7
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,759
are you playing this song
for me as an apology?

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,800
I didn't know musician's
way of apologizing...

9
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,920
could be so indirect and subtle.

10
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,370
If you think this is subtle,

11
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,880
let me try a different approach then.

12
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,320
I'll grant you three wishes...

13
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,200
as my apology.

14
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,760
Really?

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,320
Think about it.

16
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,700
Tell me when you
figure out what you want.

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
I've figured out...

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,079
my first wish.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
That fast?

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,720
I want a signed photograph of you.

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,090
But that's if you won't think of me
as your obsessive fan.

22
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Are you sure this is your first wish?

23
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,290
Of course, but I need you to
write two sentences on it.

24
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,600
Sure.

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,640
The first sentence is...

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,640
you are a good friend
who understands my music.

27
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
And the next one?

28
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,680
The next one...

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,200
The next one is...

30
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,200
Fang Yan understands Shi Yi.

31
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,280
Please accept this, my good friend.

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
That's very nice of you, superstar.

33
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm really happy today.

34
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,640
Not only we cleared up
our misunderstanding,

35
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,120
thank you for believing me too.

36
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
I'll count on you...

37
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,530
to cure my illness then.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
You're a fan who understands my music.

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
Not to mention
we'll be colleague in future.

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
There's no need for this formality.

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,400
I should get going now, bye.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,360
Hold on.

43
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,160
What's wrong?

44
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
You'll catch a cold.

45
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,360
-I'm fine.
-It's okay.

46
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,520
Protect your voice.

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,250
You have an important task.

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,960
Thank you then.

49
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,520
And thanks for your coat.

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,040
I should go now.

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,160
Bye bye.

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,640
Today is a day worth celebrating.

53
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,680
Guys, cheers!

54
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
[Cheers!]

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,760
-Shi Meng, Shi Meng, it's my fault.
-What was that?

56
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,950
That devil said the noise level...

57
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
in this house should be
kept below 40 decibels.

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,580
Or else, he's going to fine me.

59
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,920
[And I kept breaking the rules.]

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,480
[So, I thought if I used
my voice for the alert,]

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,240
[I could get him to fine me less.]

62
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,640
He's not there now, right?
Just turn it off.

63
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,400
You're right.

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,640
In that case,

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,880
why don't we start over?

66
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,480
Pretend like nothing happened?

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,960
[Sure.]

68
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,680
Today is a day worth celebrating.

69
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,440
Thank you all...

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,450
[for witnessing the major
turning point in my life.]

71
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,840
Now that I have found a cure,
I'm getting closer to my dream.

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,200
Cheers!

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
[By the way, why don't you celebrate it
here with us or in the studio?]

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,460
[The excitement is
diminished across the screen.]

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,560
It's not like I don't want to.

76
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,420
But I have to cook for the devil...

77
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,080
and I have to clean up the place...

78
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,680
before he comes back.

79
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,480
Why are we talking about him?

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,640
Let's keep this party going!

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,280
Let's keep it going!

82
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,280
-Cheers!
-[Cheers!]

[A drama queen like you...]

[Our company has opened
a live-streaming account...]

[Do you want to give it a try?]

88
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,520
Maybe I should.

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,640
Okay.

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
Use this one.

91
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,880

[Best Actress award, Fang Yan,]

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
to come on the stage
to accept her award.

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
[First of all,]

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,040
[I would like to thank my parents.]

98

Without them,

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,000
I wouldn't be standing
here today, you know?

100
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,080
[Fang Yan.]

101
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,680
Why are you calling my name?
Keep the party going.

102
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,750
Meanwhile, I would like
to thank my best friends,

103
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Zuo Yao Yao and Wei Lin.

104
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,440
If you keep it going,

105
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm going to be broke.

106
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,010
You knew the rules,
yet you still broke it.

107
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,140
Who's to blame?

108
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,920
Can't you...

109
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,960
give me a discount?

110
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,440
I can cancel it immediately...

111
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,520
if you move out.

112
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
[Never mind.]

113
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,680
[There is still a difference between
a million and a few thousands.]

114
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,760
You have three days to pay off your debt.

115
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,480
The penalty will be doubled
if your payment is one day late.

116
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,440
Three days?

117
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,320
Pay off?

118
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,320
Double?

119
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,530
Where can I get so much money...

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,760
in three days?

121
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,760
Let me see.

122
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,480
One, two, three, four, five.

123
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,120
-Five times five is 25.
-Destruction of property.

124
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,180
Another RMB5,000.

125

[Failure to comply with the above terms
will be fined RMB5,000 per violation.]

126

One, two, three, four.

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,240
My money.

128
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,440
Ouch.

129
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,600
Looks like I can only go with Wei Lin's
suggestion to do a live stream.

130
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,080
Or else, I won't even be able
to pay off the interests.

131
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,400
Eight.

132
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,560
Eight.

133
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,440
Eight.

134
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,640
800.

135
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Eight.

136
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,440
This spot should be safe
from the decibel meter.

137
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,760
Fang Yan, from now on,

138
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,680
you will see only live streaming
and makeup sponge.

139
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,200
And then, you'll get your own yacht.

140
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,080
And you'll be out of your troubles.

141
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,700
Set it up properly.

142
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,960
Hi, everyone!

143
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,120
I'm ready, I'm ready.

144
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,159
I'm ready.

145
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm Spongebob. I'm going to
review this makeup sponge today.

146
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,730
Girls, look at this makeup sponge.

147
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,680
It delivers a soft touch,
like a little fairy...

148
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,680
dancing on your skin.

149
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,720
And then,

150
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
oh my god,

151
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,480
its gentle touch gives you...

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,660
a sense of pleasure.

153
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,490
-Pat it...
-What are you doing?

154
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,420
Putting on makeup.

155
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,210
I need to take a shower now.
You have one second to get out.

156
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,840
One.

157
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,210
Not even one second.

158
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm out, I'm out.

159
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,080
Close the door.

160
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,920
Oh no.

161
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Where is my phone?

162
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm dead.

163
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm dead.

164
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,420
The camera is still on.

165
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,770
He must've been caught on live stream.

166
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,280
No, no.

167
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,560
If I open the door now,
he'll find out immediately,

168
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,600
I'll also lose all my money
to his penalty.

169
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,670
What should I do?

170
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Should I just let the whole world
watch him showering?

171
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
Fang Yan!

172
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,280
I...I saw nothing!

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,820
-I...
-What are you doing in here?

174
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,800
-I...
-Get out!

175
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,120
Get out!

176
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,000
Out!

177
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,840
What happened?

178
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,120
Yin Jiang's account
has been suspended.

179
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,280
Did she release any inappropriate content?

180
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,480
Hang up the phone now.

181
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,080
Find a way...

182
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,600
to get Fang Yan out of my sight now.

183
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,200
Right now!

184
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,680
I'll find someone to kill her then.

185
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,200
Get lost.

186
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Well, I actually have a meeting now.

187
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,100
Hello. Is this Mauritius branch?

188
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,250
Do you need a manager there?

189
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,000
Naughty.

190
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,890
I don't want to repeat it again.

191
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,000
Get Fang Yan away from me.

192
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,160
It's not that I don't want to help.

193
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,750
But it's your mother's order,

194
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,600
I can't disobey her.

195
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,520
You just want to get
the girl away from you.

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,640
It's not a big deal. I'll help you.

197
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,920
Come.

198
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,700
Just scare her off.

199
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,840
Make her move out of her own free will.

200
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,240
Will it work? It's so childish.

201
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,520
No problem!

202
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,120
The point is weren't you good
at it when you were in school?

203
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,920
Don't worry.

204
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,200
I've even prepared the props for you.

205
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,680
Relax.

206
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,440
Fang Yan,

207
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,960
just you wait.

208
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,080
What's the matter, Yao Yao?

209
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,600
[Wait,]

210
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,680
[why was
your live-streaming video removed?]

211
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,890
[The following content was blocked.]

212
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,520
I just...

213
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,320
The account was probably being hacked.

214
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,040
[Yao Yao,]

215
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,040
let me ask you something.

216
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,360
I want to know...

217
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,640
what can I do to please a man?

218
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,910
I mean, especially when someone...

219
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,320
[did something wrong to a man?]

220
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,880
The man you're talking about,

221
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
is it Shi Meng?

222
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,880
It's him.

223
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,880
You see,

224
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,680
since I'm living under his roof,

225
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,000
I have no choice but to bow down to him.

226
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
Not to mention he's in total control here,

227
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,960
I can only live a better life...

228
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,680
as long as he's happy.

229
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,380
I say, for an unemotional guy like him,

230
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,720
you'd better give up. Nothing will work.

231
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,560
But Aunt Ling said
he has bipolar disorder.

232
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,080
In fact, I can really understand
people with mental illness,

233
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,160
who is not accepted by  society.

234
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,080
So, I really want to help him.

235
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,640
My dear Fang Yan,
who has a heart of a saint,

236
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,600
[you are thinking to help others...]

237
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
[when you can't even help yourself.]

238
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,360
That's why I called her Goddess.

239
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,420
She's not like you,

240
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,800
being so mean to man.

241
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,720
[Man!]

242
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,160
Man?

243
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,960
Man? Who?

244
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,480
Tell me now, I want to know.

245
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,880
Zuo You, Zuo You...

246
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,880
I have to go.

247
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,590
Shi Meng.

248
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,120
Is that you, Shi Meng?

249
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,840
How...

250
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,960
Shi Meng, how can...

251
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
The power is out?

252
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,800
That's so scary.

253
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,200
Shi Meng!

254
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,040
Shi Meng!

255
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,520
Shi Meng!

256
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,120
Oh my god! What is that?

257
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,440
[Shi Meng]

258
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Fang Yan?

259
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,840
Fang Yan?

260
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Fang Yan!

261
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,640
Fang Yan!

262
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,160
Fang Yan!

263
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,280
Fang Yan!

264
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,060
Hello, is this 120?

265
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,440
The address is Tianbei New Area, Block 14.

266
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,280
A girl has passed out.

267
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,360
What should I do?

268
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,120
I know some basics of first aid.

269
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,000
[Calm down.]

270
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,240
[What's the patient's condition now?]

271
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,200
She is...

272
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,600
shallow breathing and...

273
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,580
unconscious.

274
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,160
[Loosen her collar and innerwear,]

275
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,280
[keep her breathing comfortably.]

276
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Okay.

277
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,800
[Let her lie flat on back.]

278
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,840
[Open the window.]

279
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
[Keep the room ventilated.]

280
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,860
[Don't panic.]

281
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,440
[The ambulance is on its way.]

282
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,280
Scissors.

283
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
Scissors... Scissors.

284
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,080
Scissors.

285
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,400
Scissors.

286
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
Done. What's next, doctor?

287
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,240
[If you have learnt first aid skills,]

288
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
[you can try performing CPR on her.]

289
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,480
CPR.

You...

294

I...

295
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,320
[Hello?]

296
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,920
[Hello?]

297
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
[Are you there?]

298
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,200
[Hello?]

299
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,320
Hello?

300
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,960
Hello, doctor. I'm conscious.

301
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,520
Yes, it's just a recurring episode.

302
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,120
-I'm so sorry.
-[Do you still need help?]

303
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
Yes, I'm fine now.
We don't need it anymore. Thank you.

304
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,400
[Okay, okay.]

305
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,380
I should go back to my room.

306
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,120
Forget it, forget it.

307
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,360
Maybe just think about it for a bit.

308
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,160
Right,

309
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,760
didn't you see him in bath too?

310
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,360
So, you're even, right?

311
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,680
Fang Yan,

312
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,780
what are you thinking?
What do you mean call it even?

313
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,040
Can't you think about something else?

314
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,060
Forget that, forget that.

315
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,660
Forget that, forget that.

316
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,320
But it was strange.

317
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
How did I wake up so soon this time?

318
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,540
Could it be both brothers can cure me?

319
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,000
Let me think about it.

320
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,400
Dr Cui said that...

321
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,520
Shi Yi's scent...

322
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,200
gives me a sense of security.

323
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,360
Scent.

324
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
Sense of security.

325
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,440
Could it be Shi Yi's coat?

326
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,280
That's it, it's his coat.

327
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,760
Where is Shi Yi's coat?

328
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Clothes.

329
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,280
There goes his scent.

330
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,240
Shi Yi's coat can cure you?

331
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,280
Because it had Shi Yi's scent on it.

332
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,360
Then ask Shi Meng for
Shi Yi's personal item now.

333
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,400
[Take advantage of his guilt.]

334
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,680
But I don't want to threaten him.

335
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,680
Girl,

336
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,360
it's not a threat.

337
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,970
It's called compensation.

338
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,120
If he has got a little bit of conscience,

339
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,920
[he should feel guilty about
what happened just now.]

340
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,600
Actually...

341
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,880
I did something wrong to him too.

342
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,320
How will it ever end between us?

343
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,640
You just worried too much.

344
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,920
[I didn't.]

345
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,400
I'm so embarrassed.

346
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,840
I'm so ashamed, Yao Yao.

347
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,600
-[Son.]
-Mum.

348
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,040
-What's wrong?
-[Nothing.]

349
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,560
[I just want to check in on you.]

350
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,720
[Are you getting along with Xiao Yan?]

351
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,120
[Did you bully her?]

352
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,640
I would never bully her.

353
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,040
That's good to hear.

354
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,240
Listen,

355
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,760
she is a good girl.

356
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,680
[You have to treat her nicely.]

357
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,960
[I've worked so hard to trick her
into moving in with you.]

358
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,840
Trick?

359
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,930
What did you do, mum?

360
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,320
Nothing.

361
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Forget it, I'm just going
to tell you the truth.

362
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,000
I told her you have bipolar disorder.

363
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,850
[I have bipolar disorder?]

364
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Yes.

365
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,500
I lied to her that you
have bipolar disorder,

366
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,600
[and I'm going abroad for a while.]

367
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,240
[So, I asked her to take care
of you for me for two months.]

368
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,320
[Listen,]

369
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,000
[she seemed really concerned when
she heard about the bipolar disorder.]

370
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,240
[No one can fake that concern.]

371
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,960
[Xiao Meng, listen to me,]

372
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,520
[be nice to her.]

373
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,320
If you ever chase her away,

374
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
you will have to deal with me.

375
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,600
I got it, mum.

376
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,410
Is there anything else?

377
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,920
Also...

378
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,120
[What is it?]

379
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,560
Shi Meng, food is ready.

380
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
[Xiao Yan is calling you, go now.]

381
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,840
[Go on.]

382
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,280
Fine, I'm hanging up.

383
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,280
How nice.

384
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
About just now...

385
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,960
Did I give you a fright?

386
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,480
It was a recurring episode.

387
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,400
It's vertigo.

388
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
I lose consciousness when I get scared.

389
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
-That...
-It's fine, it's fine.

390
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,560
It's nothing serious.

391
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,720
Eat your food, it's getting cold.

392
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,440
Okay.

393
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,200
By the way,

394
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,240
why do you have that doll at your house?

395
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,960
Because...

396
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,160
Because I'm working on
a horror film project lately,

397
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,320
I was looking for inspiration.

398
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,680
That's why...

399
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,440
Sorry.

400
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,700
I didn't know it would
trigger your illness.

401
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,840
It's okay. I know you
didn't do it on purpose.

402
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,010
But still, it was because of me.

403
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,160
Tell me how I can make it up to you.

404
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,960
Make it up to me?

405
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,480
How about I cancel all the debts?

406
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,600
[Then ask Shi Meng for
Shi Yi's personal item now.]

407
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
[Take advantage of his guilt.]

408
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,270
That's fine.

409
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,720
You can keep the debt.

410
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Can I ask for something else?

411
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,600
Go on.

412
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,840
I mean,

413
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,120
can I ask for...

414
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,720
Shi Yi's stuff,

415
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,880
preferably his personal item?

416
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,320
Preferably the one
that has his scent on it.

417
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,280
Can I?

418
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,960
Shi Yi's scent?

419
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,760
No.

420
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,400
No?

421
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,720
I said no.

422
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,800
Really?

423
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,160
Really.

424
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,880
Are you sure?

425
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,880
Is this thing really so scary?

426
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,080
Man,

427
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,720
what were you thinking?

428
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,640
I told you to scare her...

429
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,880
with something like
fake spider or fake cockroach.

430
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,800
You actually used the
puppet from Dead Silence.

431
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,040
What's so scary about Dead Silence?

432
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,550
I haven't even used the
props from The Shining.

433
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,350
The Shining?

434
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,600
Seriously, Shi Meng,

435
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,960
if you can find a wife,

436
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,880
I'll eat at your house.

437
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,540
Mr Shi, I didn't mean that.

438
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,240
If that's all, I'm going to go.

439
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,360
Wait.

440
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,000
Come here.

441
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,520
I want you to get something for me.

442
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,480
What?

443
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,720
I want...

444
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,520
Shi Yi's scent.

445
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,720
You want...

446
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,360
what?

447
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,760
Shi Yi's...

448
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,840
scent.

449
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,360
Shi Yi's...

450
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,680
what?

451
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,280
Scent.

452
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,720
You brothers are interesting.

453
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,440
-Get out!
-I...

454
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,200
[Scent of Shi Yi]

455
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,360
[Mr Shi said this is your compensation.]

456
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,760
[Scent of Shi Yi]

457
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,560
What is this?

458
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
[Shi Meng is such an idiot.]

459
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,360
[Looks like I'll get it myself.]

460
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,520
[I would like to ask you a favour.]

461
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,620
[Dr Cui]

462
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,800
Hello, Dr Cui. It's Fang Yan here.

463
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,200
I need you to help me with something.

464
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,800
What brings you here?

465
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,960
Give my patient her treatment.

466
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,880
Thank you.

467
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Here's the thing.

468
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,600
I had a trigger last night.

469
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,520
But it lasted only a few minutes.

470
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,480
After I woke up, I thought...

471
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,400
maybe it was because
I was wearing your coat.

472
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,480
So...

473
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,440
I thought...

474
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,560
So, we thought...

475
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,920
maybe your scent on the coat...

476
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,290
gives Fang Yan a sense of security.

477
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,850
I have suggested Fang Yan
to live with you before.

478
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,760
But...

479
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,440
But if this can cure her,

480
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,840
then things have become easier.

481
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
It won't affect your personal life.

482
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,580
And it can save her time from coming here.

483
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,800
I washed your coat unknowingly yesterday,

484
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,880
so I'm wondering if you can...

485
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,900
let me borrow some of your personal items?
