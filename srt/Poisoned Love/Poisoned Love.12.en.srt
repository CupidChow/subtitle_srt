[Episode 12]

4
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,039
Slow down.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,259
-Which way?
-Up ahead.

6
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
First door on the left.

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,300
Zuo Yao, I need a wet towel,

8
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
to clean his face.

9
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,620
He had been playing all day,

10
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,880
he is covered in filth.

11
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,210
Thank you for today.

12
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,960
Don't mention it.

13
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,480
Listen.

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,490
If you are happy, I am happy.

15
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,520
And I noticed something today.

16
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,280
I am getting along very well...

17
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,680
with this little kid.

18
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,190
We are buddies now.

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,480
I get it.

20
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,680
Thank you for today.

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,740
But you don't need to come here again.

22
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,850
Why?

23
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,070
But...

24
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,030
you dress the wound for me today.

25
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,829
And...

26
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,470
Zuo You likes me a lot.

27
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,350
Right?

28
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,470
I don't want to give him false hope.

29
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
The greater the hope,

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,500
the greater the disappointment.

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Hold on.

32
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,890
You won't even give me a chance.

33
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,220
How do you know I would
disappoint the kid?

34
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,550
And you saw it during the game today.

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,980
He likes to have me around.

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,640
I am willing to give him a home.

37
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,310
Yao Yao.

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
Why can't you give me a chance?

39
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,110
Why not give me a chance?

40
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,910
Fine.

41
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll tell you why I can't
give you a chance.

42
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,800
I am waiting for Zuo You's father
to come home.

43
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,329
I love him.

44
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,040
Is that clear?

45
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,440
I thought I was...

46
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,590
Do you need me to repeat myself ?

47
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:44,630
But...

48
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,510
It's getting late.

49
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,470
Rest well.

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,829
I have a meeting tomorrow.
I should get going.

51
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,590
I need to get going,
I can see myself out.

52
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,920
I am going now, goodbye.

53
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,750
I brought you here for stargazing.

54
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,079
Why are we stargazing here?

55
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,620
Because this place...

56
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,720
There is reflection on the lake.

57
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,110
There's a sky full of stars.

58
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,310
The lake reflects it.

59
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,270
It should be very romantic.

60
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,470
But now...

61
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,750
the sky is dark.

62
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,080
This place looks like where
someone dumps dead body.

63
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,030
If there was a sky full of stars,

64
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,150
and with snow,

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,440
it would be perfect.

66
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,070
You want both snow and stars?

67
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,350
How is that possible?

68
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,540
Only because you didn't understand.

69
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,659
The first snow...

70
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,130
carries a different meaning for me.

71
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,440
My father confessed his love...

72
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,010
to my mother on the first snow.

73
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,310
Then they fell in love.

74
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,710
Every year during the first snow,

75
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,190
they would go out and have a date.

76
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,710
They'd leave me alone at home.

77
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,230
No one was there to keep me company.

78
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,030
It was so lonely.

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,590
I have an idea.

80
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,880
We can bring Goo Se here...

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,140
during the first snow.

82
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,050
It will look so cute in the snow.

83
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,460
Forget it, I know you don't
have the time.

84
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,700
It's all right.

85
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,590
For the next first snow,

86
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,720
we can come here again.

87
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,730
Really?

88
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,230
Forget it.

89
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,870
Forget it.

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
Why?

91
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,360
No reason.

92
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,190
Come on.

93
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,670
Do you know?

94
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,390
If you make a wish with this lake,

95
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,920
your wish will come true...

96
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,720
if the Lake God hears your wish.

97
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:53,730
Why not give it a try?

98
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,310
That sounds silly, no way.

99
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,400
You are a producer yourself.

100
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,760
You don't even believe
in your own script?

101
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,930
How are you supposed
to convince people?

102
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,520
No one is watching right now.

103
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Just give it a go.

104
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,560
-No way.
-You don't want to do it?

105
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,520
Then I'll do it.

106
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,440
The mighty Lake God!

107
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,620
Next time,

108
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,160
I will be here for the snowing night...

109
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,350
and the sky full of stars!

110
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,560
That gets the spirit going.

111
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,490
Do you want to try it?

112
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,790
No.

113
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,800
Just once.

114
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,880
Don't be such an old man.

115
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,750
Come here.

116
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,240
Gather your courage.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,960
Lake God!

118
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,900
The Tale of Water Utopia will be top-seller!

119
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,160
There are no stars tonight.

120
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,390
Let's go home.

121
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,350
Shi Meng.

122
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,909
Five,

123
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,780
four,

124
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,230
three,

125
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,630
two,

126
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,190
Shi Meng!

127
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,830
Happy birthday!

128
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,930
Thank you for the birthday surprise.

129
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,270
Don't mention it.

130
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,950
I just want to make you happy.

131
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,080
How did you know that today is my birthday?

132
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,380
Well...

133
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,650
My heart told me so.

134
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,880
Come on.

135
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,800
This is as far as I can go to see you off.

136
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,840
I will stay here.

137
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,510
Yesterday...

138
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,230
Zuo Yao moved the things I packed.

139
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,630
Thank you...

140
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,230
for all this time.

141
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,910
I won't be bothering you again.

142
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,050
See you.

143
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,210
You are back.

144
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,060
Where have you been all day?

145
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,910
Why are you...

146
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,270
You...

147
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,310
Hush.

148
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,230
What happened?

149
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,550
Don’t cry.

150
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,370
What's wrong?

151
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,940
What happened?

152
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,030
Why are you crying?

153
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,070
What happened?

154
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,150
Let me know.

155
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,320
What should I do?
It hurts to let him go.

156
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,140
Yao Yao!

157
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,190
Calm down.

158
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,180
[She will be there for you from now on.]

159
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,070
[It's morning Shi Meng! Wake up!]

160
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,140
[Go to the field...]

161
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,690
[and not in your bed!]

162
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,790
[Healthy body...]

163
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,050
[means healthy mind!]

164
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,650
[Then your dream will finally come true!]

165
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,290
[Alarm]

166
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,370
[Stay well and calm down.]
[Eat me when frustrated.]

167
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,040
[Eat me when frustrated.]

168
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,960
[So...]

169
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,990
[Do you...]

170
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,270
[Do you...]

171
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,110
[Do you like me?]

172
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,670
[Yes.]

173
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,960
[No running away!]

174
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,790
[Smells good.]

175
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
[Shi Meng, I am sorry!]

176
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,830
[Can you not fine me so harshly?]

177
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,790
[Shi Meng, I am sorry!]

178
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,960
[Can you not fine me so harshly?]

179
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,140
[If I count to 100,]

180
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,950
[I'll be able to forget about Shi Meng.]

181
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,390
Ninety-three.

182
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,480
Ninety-four.

183
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,120
Here is your favourite Cola.

184
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,150
Ninety-five.

185
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,160
Ninety-six.

186
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,720
Ninety-seven.

187
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,930
Ninety-eight.

188
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,990
Ninety-nine.

189
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,430
One hundred?

190
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,140
What brings you here?

191
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,710
You went missing for days.

192
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,390
You wouldn't even reply to my messages.

193
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,240
I thought Yin Jiang went on a strike.

194
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,150
Or perhaps...

195
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,710
our partnership is a little
too harsh for you?

196
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,590
Not at all.

197
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,230
I am sorry.

198
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,230
I was indeed...

199
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,589
going through some of my own personal matters.

200
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,319
Aren't you recording the demo tracks?

201
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,400
I thought my job there was done.

202
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
I am sorry.

203
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,060
It's all right.

204
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,290
I was merely concerned for you.

205
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,000
Fang Yan.

206
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,569
Are you all right?

207
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,540
Shi Yi.

208
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,680
Have you ever run into
this kind of situation?

209
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,160
You wanted to move on
from the past so badly,

210
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,410
but you have no idea
what is the best way...

211
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,600
to move on.

212
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,610
I know how it feels.

213
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,600
But then I found a solution.

214
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,420
It works as a good distraction.

215
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,900
When distracted, you have no time to sulk.

216
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,680
How did you do it?

217
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,160
Are you free tomorrow?

218
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,690
Boss, we have update
from the screenwriters.

219
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,030
They have a few proposals...

220
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,160
for us to go through.

221
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,970
There is the movie "Break-up Dimension",

222
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,570
and there is the drama
"Please Don't Leave Me".

223
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,160
The last one is a web series,

224
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,420
"Goodbye, The One I Shared A House With".

225
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,730
"Goodbye, The One I Shared A House With".

226
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
Boss?

227
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,360
Shi Meng?

228
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,760
Something is on?

229
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,790
So...

230
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,910
You can decide for the proposals.

231
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,410
I trust your judgement.

232
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,140
I will head out for the meeting.

233
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,980
Wait.

234
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,920
We...

235
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,390
There is no meeting today.

236
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,120
Over here.

237
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,290
Here.

238
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,890
Why did you ask me here?

239
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,630
There is a crowd here.

240
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,780
Because...

241
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,140
they have the secret weapon
to make you happy.

242
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,940
What is it?

243
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,540
This!

244
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,030
Stinky tofu?

245
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,580
This stench...

246
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,390
I never thought...

247
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,890
the glamorous and shining celebrity...

248
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,420
would like this stench!

249
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,550
Do you think I don't eat human foods?

250
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,020
Could this be...

251
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,340
the secret weapon...

252
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,860
to make me feel happy?

253
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,700
Eating...

254
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,060
will cheer you up.

255
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,510
That's because...

256
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,720
stomach and heart are close to each other.

257
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,070
When your stomach is full,

258
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,520
your warm stomach will
get closer to your heart,

259
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,650
that will fill in the gap in your heart.

260
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,680
I feel like your theory makes sense,

261
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,220
but what if your fans recognize you?

262
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,290
I often sneak out to have a bite.

263
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,860
I am good at this.

264
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,970
But...

265
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,780
Enough excuses.

266
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,100
Here, try it out.

267
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,200
Fine.

268
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,420
-Do you like it?
-I love it!

269
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,660
This is heavenly! Try some.

270
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,560
Sure.

271
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,280
That really is Shi Yi!

272
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,100
Are you really Shi Yi?

273
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,710
He really is Shi Yi!

274
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,540
Gather around!

275
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,060
He is not Shi Yi.

276
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,000
He is not!

277
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,360
Run!

278
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,480
Shi Yi!

279
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,070
You shouldn't take off the mask!

280
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,490
I can't eat while wearing it!

281
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,340
This way!

282
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,860
Shi Yi loves stinky tofu!

283
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,700
Shouldn't your fans
be gentle and adorable?

284
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,580
What was that?

285
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,120
Just run!

286
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,840
What do we do now?

287
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,580
Come with me.

288
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,860
-Come on.
-Hurry up! Shi Yi is over there!

289
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,260
Where is he?

290
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,960
Mr Shi.

291
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,520
Mr Shi, what are you doing here?

292
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,560
When was this place last cleaned?

293
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,700
The janitor...

294
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,220
is not doing a great job.

295
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,020
I need to have a word with her.

296
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,900
I'll leave the supervising to you,

297
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,790
I have to go.

298
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,960
Today...

299
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,180
we'll have Fang Yan with us.

300
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,760
We need to discuss
about the publicity...

301
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,880
and promotion of Vitality Studio.

302
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,720
Carry on with the work.

303
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,740
Hold on.

304
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,030
Well...

305
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,700
I'll go with you.

306
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,740
After all,

307
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,460
I can listen to the discussion.

308
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,300
Sure.

309
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,580
Let's go.

310
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,120
How clumsy of me.

311
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,340
I just remembered.

312
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,940
Fang Yan won't be here today.

313
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,100
Voice actors like her...

314
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,840
are only here for the try-out.

315
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,740
The work was done a few days ago.

316
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,620
So...

317
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,420
she won't be here until
the filming is over.

318
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,870
She can't come here
if there is no work?

319
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,820
Tell her...

320
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,700
she won't have to be here again.

321
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,980
Men's words...

322
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,420
are the real lies.

323
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,820
Boss, was Shi Yi here just now?

324
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,000
Buy a drink and I will tell you.

325
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,900
Fine!

326
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,960
I'll have one.

327
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,300
Here you go.

328
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,920
-Where is Shi Yi?
-Sorry, no one came in here.

329
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,770
What? I bought a drink!

330
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,540
-Come on!
-No one came in here?

331
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,820
I told you what I know.

332
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,460
Forget it, we will check it ourselves.

333
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,260
Exactly!

334
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,300
Fine.

335
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,750
Pay for the whole place.

336
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,420
Are you crazy?

337
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,300
Seriously!

338
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,280
I almost had a heart attack.

339
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,060
Who would have thought?

340
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,660
You always seem like a gentle person,

341
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,260
but you managed to
pull off something so crazy.

342
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,930
After the great escape,

343
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,460
do you feel better now?

344
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
I think I am feeling much better now.

345
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,480
Boss, thanks.

346
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,990
I should thank you.

347
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,640
