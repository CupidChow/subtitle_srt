1
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,439
Welcome.

2
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,879
Do you prefer cats or dogs?

3
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,640
Uncle, I'm Li Cai.

4
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,519
Li Lili's younger brother.

5
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,640
So you are...

6
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,640
Lili's younger brother.

7
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,439
Come in, please.

8
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,240
Have a seat.

9
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,800
The slops drink Lili gave me—

10
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,240
That drink.

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,520
Slops drink.

12
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,159
You made it?

13
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,919
I made it.

14
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,000
You two get along well.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,319
Why does it feel like I'm being pranked?

16
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:19,879
This...

17
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,479
By the way, Uncle—

18
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,960
My sis made this lunch for you.

19
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:22,960
Please try it.

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:25,919
It's fine.

21
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,400
My sis said her cooking improved.

22
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,280
Forget I said that.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,680
It's okay.

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,360
I have instant noodles.

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,000
It's fine, really.

26
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,360
I made this drink.

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,840
No, no, no.

28
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,439
Yes, yes, yes.

29
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,319
There's instant noodles.

30
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,599
What are you listening to?

31
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,039
Listening to it talk to you.

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,840
Yeah.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What—what did it say?

34
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,560
It told me—

35
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,680
This alpaca's pen used to—

36
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,520
Need cleaning once a day.

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Now it's cleaned every three days.

38
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,360
Is this lousy pet shop going under?

39
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,199
The alpaca's right.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,240
Such a big pet shop—

41
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,560
Only me as a temp worker.

42
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,520
It's exhausting.

43
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,400
Alpacas are so straightforward.

44
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,080
Eat, poop, repeat.

45
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,879
I'm doing two people's work alone.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
Boss Meng.

47
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,919
Have you thought about giving me a raise?

48
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,199
You two are playing off each other.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,080
You two said it—

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Not the alpaca, right?

51
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,080
It was the alpaca.

52
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,240
I'm just its mouth stand-in.

53
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,360
Uncle Meng.

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
I think what it said makes sense.

55
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,639
For animals to grow—

56
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,919
They need a good environment.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,840
Only with a good environment—

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Can they be healthy.

59
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,319
You're so good with animals—

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,879
Why not help out here?

61
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,840
Really?

62
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,039
Why are you excited?

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
He's making you work for free.

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,520
How is it free labor?

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,280
Think about it—

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,719
At those cat cafés or dog cafés—

67
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,479
Petting cats and dogs—

68
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,479
You have to pay them, right?

69
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,879
Here, you don't spend a cent.

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:03:59,919
Exactly.

71
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,120
So I save money.

72
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,560
Isn't that like earning money?

73
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,879
That logic checks out.

74
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,719
That's what I'm saying.

75
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,919
See, this kid is smart.

76
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,960
Alright, alright.

77
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,439
If both sides agree, it's fine.

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,879
Anyway, more help for me.

79
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,680
That's not a bad thing.

80
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,240
So—

81
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,080
Your pay—

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,479
Shouldn't you give some back?

83
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,480
No, no, no.

84
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,040
No.

85
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:17,959
No.

86
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,399
It's down.

87
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
It's down, it's down.

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,120
How is it down?

89
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,279
Isn't it still in the tree?

90
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,040
Yeah.

91
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,680
The cat's down.

92
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,040
Dad.

93
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,279
The cat's down—

94
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,759
But my brother's still up there.

95
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,120
My cat is purebred.

96
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,319
It's worth ten or twenty thousand.

97
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,199
My brother's purebred too!

98
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,079
Not pure.

99
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,480
No, Dad—

100
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,920
How could you let him—

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,839
Do something so dangerous?

102
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,480
No—

103
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,160
You really can't blame me for this.

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,000
Originally—

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,639
The cat was fine in the cage.

106
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,120
He said cats shouldn't be caged.

107
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,240
Cats need freedom.

108
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,160
So he opened the cage.

109
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,000
As soon as it opened—

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,959
The cat bolted out.

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,720
I hadn't even reacted—

112
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,959
And your brother bolted out too.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,759
Yeah.

114
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,279
Now it's not stuck in the cage—

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,720
It's stuck in the tree.

116
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,399
Stop with the sarcastic comments.

117
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm warning you—

118
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,560
If anything happens to our kid—

119
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,160
You owe me emotional damages.

120
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,519
Now it's your kid?

121
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,600
This kid—

122
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,279
Don't rush to jump.

123
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,000
Find a better spot.

124
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
Slow, slow down.

125
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,560
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

126
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,680
Is that okay?

127
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,800
Sis, I'm fine.

128
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,519
It's all good now.

129
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,560
This kid is really strong.

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,480
Next time the cat climbs a tree,
it's up to you again.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,439
Dad.

132
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,680
Let's not have a next time.

133
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
There won't be a next time.

134
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,079
Exactly.

135
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,759
Stop picking on the honest kid.

136
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,759
Making him do such risky work.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
You need to pay extra.

138
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,120
Mom.

139
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:02,800
Bro.

140
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,079
How about we find a proper job?

141
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
I disagree with that.

142
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,000
My job isn't improper at all.

143
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,439
It doesn't even pay a salary.

144
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,839
How is that a proper job?

145
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,120
Kid.

146
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
Go work for a big company.

147
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,519
You can earn more there.

148
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
I'm not going to a big company.

149
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,040
Big companies

150
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,240
will restrict my freedom.

151
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,160
See?

152
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,920
See?

153
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,680
Alright.

154
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,800
You're free now.

155
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,759
So this

156
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,439
goes back to our alpaca first.

157
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,199
Cai.

158
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,399
Have you ever heard this saying?

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,800
The greater the ability,

160
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,680
the greater the responsibility.

161
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,759
Never heard it.

162
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,240
What's up?

163
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,560
Here's the thing.

164
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,079
There's a saying that goes like this:

165
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,560
The greater the ability,

166
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,560
the greater the responsibility.

167
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
Heard it now?

168
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,040
Heard it now.

169
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,720
Let me ask you.

170
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,920
Now that you're at home,

171
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,319
you have no responsibilities, right?

172
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,199
Yeah, that's great.

173
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,839
No need to be responsible.

174
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,720
You have no responsibility.

175
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,519
Does that mean you have no ability?

176
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,040
That's not true.

177
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,040
I've got plenty of ability.

178
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,000
Darn it, that's it.

179
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,120
With so much ability,

180
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,800
shouldn't you take on big responsibilities?

181
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,519
We can't waste talent at home.

182
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,199
We should go out and do something.

183
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,279
Aren't I wasting it at home?

184
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,240
I've got so much ability,

185
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,560
so I should take on big responsibilities.

186
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,000
Right.

187
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,279
How do I take on big responsibilities?

188
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,079
I should go to a big company.

189
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,600
That's right.

190
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm going to look for a job.

191
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,480
Good for you.

192
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,759
Do you have a resume?

193
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,279
No.

194
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:16,959
Ask your brother-in-law.

195
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,759
Let him make one for you.

196
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,439
He's got experience.

197
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,120
Right.

198
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,439
That's his responsibility.

199
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,160
Go ahead.

200
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
That's not my responsibility.

201
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,040
But it shows your ability.

202
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,079
I'll go find him.

203
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,879
Don't make each word in your title
a different color.

204
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,839
It looks so much better this way.

205
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,879
All those bright colors.

206
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,360
What's up with your photo?

207
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,560
Isn't that what you told me?

208
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,360
Wear your best outfit for the photo.

209
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,639
Your best outfit

210
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,120
is the Ultraman bodysuit.

211
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:00,920
Yeah.

212
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,199
Wait, wait, wait...

213
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,399
This specialty—this needs to change.

214
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
What did you even write here?

215
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
Can drink cola through my nose.

216
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,720
Can recite all Ultraman names.

217
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,720
Didn't shower for two and a half years.

218
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
What kind of skills are these?

219
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,360
How are these not skills?

220
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,480
Let me ask you two—

221
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,319
Can either of you do any of these three?

222
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,519
Honestly, no.

223
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Darn it, that's it then.

224
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,680
No, wait.

225
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,439
I have another skill to add.

226
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,759
I can keep

227
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,000
cross-eyed for half an hour straight.

228
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,279
Stay cross-eyed nonstop.

229
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,960
Delete that right now.

230
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,559
Sis,

231
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,399
are you jealous of my skills?

232
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,919
Jealous of you?

233
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,919
I want to hit you.

234
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,519
Talk to the kid

235
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,440
a little nicer, will you?

236
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,159
Now you want to play the good guy.

237
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,600
You never care any other time.

238
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,399
Listen to me—

239
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,799
When I teach him, don't butt in.

240
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,159
If something goes wrong, it's on you.

241
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,480
His weird thinking is just like yours.

242
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,440
Like me? How is it like me?

243
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
It's all the environment's fault.

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,039
You rubbed off on him.

245
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,679
Enough, enough.

246
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,600
You two, stop arguing.

247
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,720
Try to be mature.

248
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,759
Okay?

249
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,559
If there's a problem,

250
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,360
I'll take responsibility.

251
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,000
Forget it, forget it.

252
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,080
Write whatever you want.

253
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,480
Show off your talent.

254
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,279
I think your brother's an idiot.

255
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,879
You're the idiot.

256
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm telling you, watch your mouth.

257
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
I think sharing our experiences with him

258
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,600
is totally useless.

259
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,039
He'll still make the same mistakes.

260
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
Aren't I worried he'll suffer?

261
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,840
Suffer?

262
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,519
You have to suffer to learn.

263
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,240
Every young person goes through this.

264
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,840
So why repeat our mistakes?

265
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,519
The paths we've already taken—

266
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,679
If we can avoid them, why not?

267
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,200
Done writing.

268
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,279
All finished.

269
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,399
Let's figure out which company to apply to.

270
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,240
No need to think about it.

271
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,679
I've already sent out a hundred resumes.

272
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,799
To HR at all the big companies.

273
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,240
Next,

274
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,679
it's their turn to fight over me.

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,360
Tell me—

276
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
if they really start fighting for me,

277
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,960
should I go to

278
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,919
Tencent

279
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,120
or Apple?

280
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,200
That's the question.

281
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,159
Tencent.

282
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,679
Apple.

283
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,240
Come in.

284
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,440
Come in, Xiao Li.

285
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,000
Have a seat.

286
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,679
Looks like the expert we hired

287
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,679
was really accurate.

288
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,360
Said we'd have important guests.

289
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,279
And here they are.

290
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
They're all top graduates.

291
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,840
Call each one quickly.

292
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,799
Pick the best one.

293
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,159
Send out the offer letter fast.

294
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,279
Tsinghua, Peking, Stanford—

295
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,080
all fighting to work for us.

296
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,679
That's because of Three No's and One Creation.

297
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,559
Three steps, one crash.

298
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,120
Wouldn't that kill you?

299
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,600
It's our company's new philosophy.

300
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,960
The Three No's and One Creation concept.

301
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,240
Read it and you'll see.

302
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,240
Our company is led by an academician.

303
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,480
About to go public.

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,919
Strictly follows

305
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,919
no overtime,

306
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,720
no rat race,

307
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,720
no internal strife—the Three No's.

308
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,519
We offer employees a flexible,

309
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,399
diverse growth platform.

310
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,240
Create

311
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
the greatest value in life.

312
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Three No's and One Creation, right?

313
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,799
So when you communicate,

314
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,000
on this basis,

315
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,679
be sure to

316
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,240
raise our company's image

317
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,360
even higher.

318
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,919
No, but—

319
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,159
We're using this to lure people in.

320
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,679
Once they're hired,

321
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,679
how do we deliver on it?

322
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,080
Don't worry about that.

323
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm number one at making empty promises.

324
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,840
No way I can't keep talent.

325
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,879
Plus,

326
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,159
my wife loves me so much.

327
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,799
How could I not work hard?

328
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,159
That's true.

329
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,240
Of course.

330
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,360
And then

331
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,039
For those who didn't make it,

332
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,240
send them a rejection letter too.

333
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,279
Just say their information

334
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,360
is now in our talent pool.

335
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,960
Darn it, maybe we'll work together
in the future.

336
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,720
Make it sound gentle.

337
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,200
Our company's talent pool—

338
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,039
where is that, anyway?

339
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,720
We don't even have such a thing.

340
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,559
Doesn't it make us look professional?

341
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,000
Just toss these two out.

342
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,279
No need to send a rejection letter.

343
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:53,720
Waste of electricity.

344
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,039
Especially this one.

345
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,799
This one looks neither human nor ghost.

346
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,679
This one.

347
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,600
Isn't that okay?

348
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
I think it looks fine.

349
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,039
It's so colorful.

350
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,120
See?

351
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,200
Just throw it away.

352
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,440
No need.

353
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,639
Isn't this—

354
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,159
It has

355
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
design, right?

356
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,399
I think it's creative.

357
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,559
Fury makes my hair stand on end.

358
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,559
By the railing,

359
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,320
as the rain stops.

360
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,480
I look up.

361
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,600
I cry out to the sky.

362
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,960
My heart burns with passion.

363
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,840
Thirty years of fame, now dust and dirt.

364
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,879
Eight thousand miles under clouds and moon.

365
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,159
Don't waste your youth.

366
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,399
Let your hair turn white young.

367
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,639
Only regret remains.

368
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,799
What's wrong with him?

369
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,200
He sent out one hundred resumes.

370
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,919
Got ninety-nine rejection letters.

371
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,320
Feels like no one understands him.

372
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,519
His greatest ambition.

373
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,000
He empathizes with Yue Fei.

374
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:06,720
This kid—

375
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,360
Did he get hit too hard?

376
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,679
Maybe he's having mental issues?

377
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,840
I told you your brother's a fool.

378
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,480
Hello.

379
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:51,360
Yes, this is Ideal Design.

380
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,720
Let me ask you,

381
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,559
why did you choose our company?

382
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,039
I heard this job has flexible hours.

383
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,919
No need to clock in.

384
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,840
That's right.

385
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,879
It's super flexible.

386
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,120
Yesterday at 3 a.m.,

387
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,559
my boss asked me for a proposal.

388
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,519
The main thing is being unpredictable.

389
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,159
The company benefits are great.

390
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,600
We offer five insurances and one fund.

391
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,759
You sign a labor contract,

392
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,320
and also a non-compete agreement.

393
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,080
Your interests are fully protected.

394
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,720
A non-compete agreement?

395
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,399
What does a non-compete mean?

396
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,440
After you leave,

397
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,320
you can't work in renovation anymore.

398
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,159
Even changing a bulb at home—

399
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,240
better be careful.

400
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,399
Could lead to legal trouble.

401
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,480
But I don't think you need to worry.

402
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,080
Just don't quit, and it's fine.

403
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,320
Got another one done.

404
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,120
The company has a shuttle bus.

405
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,279
You have your own car?

406
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,600
That's even more convenient.

407
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,919
Let me check your address.

408
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,039
You live downtown.

409
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,159
Our company is moving soon.

410
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,159
If there's no traffic,

411
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,360
from your home to the office

412
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
is just three hours.

413
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,360
Why is the job market

414
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,399
so hot right now?

415
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,879
They all joined other companies.

416
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
It's your Three No's and One Creation.

417
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,440
Didn't create it right.

418
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,080
I did create it.

419
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,720
I created each one.

420
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:20,279
So—

421
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,159
Why did they all leave?

422
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,480
Not all of them left.

423
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,240
There's still one here.

424
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,600
Why don't I remember this one?

425
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,759
Looks pretty smart to me.

426
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,879
I missed this person.

427
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,600
Yeah.

428
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,480
I thought it was a pity at the time.

429
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,639
I talked to this guy.

430
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,840
His skills

431
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,159
match our company's strength

432
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,399
really well.

433
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,440
Mainly, he really appreciates

434
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,720
your Three No's and One Creation.

435
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,559
And

436
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,120
he asks for a low salary.

437
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,120
Contact him quickly.

438
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:49,799
Call him.

439
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,840
We're hiring a project assistant anyway.

440
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,519
Doesn't matter.

441
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,240
Don't waste any more time.

442
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,399
Our main focus

443
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,559
is President Wang's project.

444
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,360
Okay.

445
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,159
I'll contact him right now.

446
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,440
Three No's and One Creation.

447
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,440
I'll put more effort into creating.

448
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:02,799
Right.

449
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,080
Okay.

450
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,080
Create him.

451
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,840
Cai.

452
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,600
Cai, you must do well tomorrow.

453
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,840
Our boss lately—

454
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,840
is worried about a project.

455
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,080
Don't make him upset.

456
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,399
I'm telling you,

457
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,679
remember this.

458
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,919
This job wasn't easy to get.

459
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,759
You have no idea behind the scenes

460
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,159
how much I've worked for you.

461
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,720
It's all for you.

462
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:33,840
Th-this—

463
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,120
Why are you crying now?

464
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,759
No, sis—

465
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:39,759
You worked too hard.

466
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,159
I'm so touched.

467
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,039
You kid—

468
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,759
With your grateful heart,

469
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm already very moved.

470
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,320
Don't cry, it's okay.

471
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,240
I'm hanging up.

472
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,720
Fight monsters.

473
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,679
Worked too hard.

474
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,680
This is the office area.

475
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,759
Usually, with your colleagues,

476
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,039
get along well with everyone.

477
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,079
Learn more from others.

478
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,960
Don't always stand with your hands behind your back.

479
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,359
Are you acting like a boss here?

480
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,680
Be a bit more humble.

481
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,400
Up ahead is the break room.

482
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,000
There's tea and coffee.

483
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,480
You can have cold or hot water.

484
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,440
This is the copy room.

485
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,519
If you have any documents

486
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,000
to print or copy, do it here.

487
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,599
This is the general manager's office.

488
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,000
You—

489
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,720
What are you doing here?

490
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:45,680
Sis.

491
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:47,759
Sis, look.

492
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,440
What are you doing?

493
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,119
ID photo.

494
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,519
Can you do something serious?

495
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,400
Do you know how hard it was

496
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,559
to get this job here?

497
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,200
I know.

498
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,759
You know?

499
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,400
Yeah.

500
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,920
There were so many people

501
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,640
competing for this position with me.

502
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,319
Do you know why I stood out?

503
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:03,960
Do you know?

504
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:05,559
Why?

505
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:06,759
It's because

506
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,880
I didn't write my resume

507
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,720
the traditional way like you did.

508
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,720
My resume

509
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,599
was unique.

510
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,559
So the boss valued my talent.

511
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:14,839
That's why at work

512
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,880
I can't just follow the rules like you.

513
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,799
Otherwise, I'd just become

514
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,240
an ordinary corporate slave.

515
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,000
Wait, who are you talking about?

516
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,359
Of course, I don't mean you, sis.

517
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,079
Don't call me sis.

518
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,319
Sis.

519
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,079
Everyone else is working overtime.

520
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,279
But you two are just arguing here.

521
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,799
I heard you from far away.

522
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,839
Chattering nonstop.

523
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,839
Xiao Li, who is this?

524
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,079
You know my name is Xiao Li?

525
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:38,680
This is my sis.

526
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
I'm Xiao Li.

527
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,599
This is our company's new assistant.

528
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,519
I'm showing him around.

529
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,279
This kid is really sweet-talking.

530
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,319
Calls everyone "sis."

531
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,279
Really?

532
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,039
No, auntie.

533
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:53,960
Not sis.

534
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,119
You—

535
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:55,920
Hurry up and go.

536
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,680
Stop messing around here.

537
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,440
Go to work now.

538
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,920
Time to work.

539
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,160
Hurry up, it's busy.

540
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,960
Get to work, get to work.

541
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,400
Didn't I tell you this was the third draft?

542
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,519
Why did you send the fourth draft to the boss?

543
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:22,839
It's the fourth draft.

544
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,880
I revised one draft.

545
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,640
So it's the fourth draft.

546
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,480
Why does an assistant get to change my design?

547
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,079
No—

548
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,599
An assistant

549
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,480
is supposed to help fix what's unreasonable.

550
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:31,960
Um—

551
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,880
Sorry, sorry.

552
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:33,920
I need you for something urgent.

553
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,279
Come.

554
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:34,920
Sorry.

555
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,759
Hurry, hurry.

556
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,319
What are you doing over there?

557
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,319
Designing.

558
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,319
Isn't this a design company?

559
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,920
What kind of design is that?

560
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
Colleagues are already stressed working overtime.

561
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,039
Don't make things worse.

562
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:50,759
No—

563
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,160
The boss picked me out of thousands.

564
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,960
For what reason?

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,839
Just to have me print documents every day?

566
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,920
He must want me to lead a big project.

567
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,599
You even burn instant noodles.

568
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,039
And you want to lead a project?

569
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,880
I've already led one.

570
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,160
I've sent out the company's guidelines.

571
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,200
I've already distributed them.

572
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,759
What guidelines?

573
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,559
I posted them in the group, didn't you see?

574
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,240
I even tagged everyone.

575
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,720
Can you check the group promptly at work?

576
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,839
Delete it right now.

577
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,079
Why delete it?

578
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,119
I get what you mean.

579
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,039
Don't worry.

580
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,559
If I become a department head,

581
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,799
I'll promote you first.

582
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,480
You, a leader?

583
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,880
No, do you really think

584
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,480
the boss hired you for your genius?

585
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,759
That's why you got the job?

586
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,559
Otherwise, why?

587
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,519
Fine.

588
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,519
I can't deal with you anymore.

589
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,160
I'm taking you to see the boss now.

590
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,359
Let's talk this out.

591
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:42,759
Come.

592
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:44,200
Come.

593
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,119
What for?

594
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:51,640
Come in.

595
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,519
Boss.

596
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,279
I was just looking for you, Xiao Li.

597
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,119
What's up, President Li?

598
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,519
I'm looking for Xiao Li.

599
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,680
Still pretending to be calm, huh?

600
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,519
It's about you.

601
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,720
The folks from design just now

602
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,759
already reported everything to me.

603
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,119
See?

604
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,240
You randomly posted stuff in the work group.

605
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,319
President Li already knows.

606
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,640
Of course I know.

607
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,359
Thanks to Xiao Li,

608
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,160
we managed to save such a big project.

609
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,640
It's what I should do.

610
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
W-what's going on?

611
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,440
You don't know about President Wang's project?

612
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,720
I do know.

613
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,680
His villa.

614
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,880
His eight-year-old son was never satisfied, right?

615
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,200
So I couldn't figure it out.

616
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,839
Luckily, Xiao Li

617
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,400
pointed out the real issue.

618
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,759
The design team just now

619
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,559
sent the latest plan to President Wang.

620
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:40,400
Father and son

621
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,519
were very satisfied.

622
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,400
You really get design.

623
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:45,920
Yeah.

624
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,160
I spotted it right away.

625
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,400
President Wang's son's bedroom

626
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,279
had design issues.

627
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,240
Look here.

628
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,440
The designer put in a bunch of Ultraman.

629
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,680
But they were all wrong.

630
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:55,920
Belial,

631
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,160
Camearra, and Tregear

632
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,200
are all from the evil side.

633
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,240
How could you include them?

634
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,000
And also,

635
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,519
the background is the M78 Nebula.

636
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,960
They added people from the O50 Nebula

637
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,200
and the L77 Nebula

638
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,799
into the design.

639
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,599
How could the kid not get mad?

640
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:07,720
See?

641
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,839
It's all technical terms.

642
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,759
Very professional.

643
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,319
I'm planning to sign the contract with President Wang this weekend.

644
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,240
Finalize the details.

645
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,400
I have to bring you, the hero.

646
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,960
Sure.

647
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,000
Get up.

648
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,400
I'm up.

649
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,160
Li Lili,

650
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,319
you contributed too.

651
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,359
Thanks to your advice,

652
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,599
otherwise we would've missed out

653
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,759
on such a great talent.

654
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:30,920
Right?

655
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,359
Well,

656
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,079
It's what I should do.

657
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:32,599
By the way, you—

658
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,240
Why did you come in to see me?

659
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,920
It's about this.

660
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,039
This matter.

661
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,000
So it's settled, isn't it?

662
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,480
If there's nothing else,

663
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,160
get back to work.

664
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,880
Let's go.

665
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,599
No, that's not what I meant.

666
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,079
Did you two get what I said?

667
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,359
My boss wants to focus on training him now.

668
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,400
They're grooming him for a management role.

669
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,079
Darn it, isn't that settled?

670
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,559
Isn't that a good thing?

671
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,480
Your brother's job is stable now.

672
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,759
The boss really values him.

673
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,759
Isn't that great?

674
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,240
No wonder he's been talking to me lately.

675
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,319
That's different now.

676
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,319
He talks to me while cleaning the litter.

677
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,759
Calibrate the granularity.

678
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,279
Do structural optimization.

679
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,279
What does that mean?

680
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,640
It means the cat litter doesn't clump.

681
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,480
Did it clump together?

682
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,799
He leveled it out with the scoop.

683
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,519
That's a good thing.

684
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,319
I think it's pretty good.

685
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,039
Just think about it.

686
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,440
When someone is capable,

687
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,720
you can pile on the responsibility.

688
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,519
When you give responsibility,

689
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,799
their ability shoots up.

690
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,920
That's a good thing.

691
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,400
What ability does he have?

692
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
He just got lucky this time.

693
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,279
If he becomes a leader later,

694
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,960
won't he cause even bigger trouble?

695
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,240
No, listen to yourself.

696
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,359
How can you be sure

697
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,559
he'll definitely mess up?

698
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,799
You have to give him a chance to prove himself.

699
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,160
Let him grow freely.

700
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,559
How do you know the path you chose

701
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,599
is really right for him?

702
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,880
Right.

703
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,920
There's a song that goes like this.

704
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,759
There's a kind of love called letting go.

705
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:04,599
One.

706
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,359
Two.

707
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,079
One.

708
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,559
Two.

709
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,039
Go.

710
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,240
There's a kind of love—

711
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,359
Can you get to the point?

712
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,519
We all know how to sing it.

713
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,119
But it's hard to actually do it.

714
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,440
Think about why that is.

715
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,559
Besides,

716
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,160
Hanghang,

717
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:17,960
I—

718
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,599
Well—

719
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,440
Resolutely let go.

720
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,519
Isn't that good?

721
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,119
Isn't it good?

722
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,079
Dad, that's not it.

723
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,039
You're just plain lazy.

724
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,960
So you mean to say

725
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,160
my brother is actually capable,

726
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:30,799
I just never noticed?

727
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,720
Yeah.

728
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:32,720
Let me tell you,

729
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,920
I think Li Cai

730
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,559
has a lot of good qualities.

731
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,240
Right.

732
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:36,960
For example,

733
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,680
when he worked at our pet shop,

734
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,519
he could listen to the alpaca's feelings.

735
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,119
Really?

736
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,400
My dad's done this for years,

737
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
and he never had that skill.

738
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,960
Then you really don't know me.

739
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,240
Why did I open a pet shop?

740
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:48,759
It shows

741
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,559
my ability to communicate with animals

742
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,319
is absolutely top-notch.

743
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,920
This, uh—

744
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,480
That's way too easy.

745
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,559
Isn't that just how he is?

746
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,559
Alpaca,

747
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,160
see?

748
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,039
How nice.

749
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,279
Totally able to communicate.

750
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,160
Let's have a chat.

751
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,319
See, it's not hard.

752
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,000
Today, you—

753
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,839
Hey, hey, don't run away.

754
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,839
Let's talk, let's talk.

755
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,440
How are you feeling today?

756
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:12,319
Dad.

757
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,960
Dad.

758
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,240
Are you okay, Dad?

759
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:14,920
Dad.

760
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,240
Humans

761
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,480
develop affection for their family.

762
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,000
But today,

763
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,880
I learned an important lesson.

764
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,480
Too much care

765
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,519
can actually backfire.

766
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,559
A psychology expert once said,

767
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,119
in this world,

768
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,079
all love

769
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,000
aims to bring people together.

770
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,519
Only one kind of love

771
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,839
is meant for separation.

772
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,240
And that's

773
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,920
the love parents have for their children.

774
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,960
True, successful love

775
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,039
is letting children

776
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,000
become independent as soon as possible.

777
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,400
Let go and let them do what they love.

778
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,240
That way,

779
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,839
they can find their own

780
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,200
bright future.

781
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,279
What a lousy job.

782
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:02,920
I'm quitting.

783
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,440
What happened?

784
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,400
Why?

785
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,000
President Wang's dumb son—

786
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:08,880
he insists

787
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,160
Ultraman Tiga can beat Ultraman King.

788
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,119
Can he really win?

789
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,039
Of course not.

790
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,720
He doesn't believe it.

791
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,480
He keeps arguing with me.

792
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,200
We started bickering.

793
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,200
Then we got into a fight.

794
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,200
You know who's the most annoying?

795
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,920
Your boss.

796
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,359
It's one thing for a kid to be clueless,

797
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,680
but your boss took sides.

798
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,039
Lousy company.

799
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:22,680
I'm quitting.

800
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:25,960
What are you writing, sis?

801
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:28,880
Nothing at all.

802
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,160
I suggest you quit too.

803
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,200
Everyone should just quit.

804
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,200
Dear Interstellar Encyclopedia Editorial Team,

805
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,759
On behalf of six billion Earthlings,

806
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,400
I present Ultraman to our home planet.

807
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,519
He stands for justice,

808
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,440
hope,

809
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,400
and light.

810
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,279
The most powerful among them is

811
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,319
Ultraman King.

812
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,160
Even Ultraman Tiga,

813
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,799
Ultraman Zero,

814
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,279
or Ultraman Noa

815
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,119
can't defeat him.

816
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,799
Please be sure to include this

817
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,680
in our Interstellar Encyclopedia.

818
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:06,799
Publish it across the universe

819
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,039
to show our

820
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:08,759
scientific rigor

821
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,720
and precision.

822
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,519
You should study something useful instead.

823
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,480
Check out the Four Great Classical Novels on the shelf.
