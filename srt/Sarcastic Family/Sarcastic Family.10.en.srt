1
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm right here.

2
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,879
I see you.

3
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,599
Why else would I walk around?

4
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,639
You three standing here

5
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,599
kind of look like that

6
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,759
S

7
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,039
SHE

8
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,280
SOS

9
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
You're so funny.

10
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,639
You're really funny.

11
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,520
Lili

12
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,039
Sorry about that.

13
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,800
About this wedding,

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,319
I might have to miss it.

15
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,159
Let's go.

16
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,039
Let's head out.

17
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,759
In your mouth,

18
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
mumbling and stuffed full.

19
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,840
Still shouting,

20
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,759
"I'm going to tear you apart!"

21
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,199
And throw you in the fryer.

22
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,560
Dreaming of something tasty?

23
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm in your dream.

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,479
You're in my pot.

25
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,319
What are you doing?

26
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,280
My douzhi.

27
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,560
Douzhi, douzhi.

28
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,680
Douzhi.

29
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,280
It's gone sour.

30
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,800
That's just how it tastes.

31
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,520
It.

32
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,080
Drink some water.

33
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,280
What a shame.

34
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,719
Here.

35
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,680
Lili's not happy.

36
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,280
Is she?

37
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,399
She's mad at you.

38
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,319
It's her period.

39
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,360
You're the one on your period.

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,000
You all—

41
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,600
Don't—don't mind him.

42
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,240
Your whole company is on their period.

43
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,040
Well,

44
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,879
She was fine before bed last night.

45
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,720
What happened?

46
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,199
I had a nightmare last night.

47
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,600
I dreamed we held

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,079
a huge, grand wedding.

49
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,199
That's great!

50
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,759
We can't put this off.

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
A lot of elderly people,

52
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
when they get older,

53
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,639
leave just like that.

54
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,759
Dad, dad—

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,959
Right now,

56
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,759
don't play the emotional card.

57
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,199
No,

58
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,720
I mean my old classmates.

59
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,199
If they pass away,

60
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,639
I won't get my wedding cash gift back.

61
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,439
It's fine.

62
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,439
When you're gone,

63
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,759
we can make some money.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,759
I get it.

65
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,240
It's just Dad pushing us.

66
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,680
That's why Lili's so anxious.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,680
Keeps having dreams.

68
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,560
No,

69
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,040
About this,

70
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,920
Lili and I agreed

71
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
not to have a wedding.

72
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Skip all those unnecessary formalities.

73
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,160
And old customs.

74
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,000
That's settled.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,720
Let's not—let's drop it.

76
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,160
Drop it.

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,360
Um—

78
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,959
Is that okay, Lili?

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,639
I'm full.

80
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,399
I'm off to work.

81
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,040
Wait—

82
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't go.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,920
Wait for me.

84
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,879
Stop pushing.

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,040
Why do you keep pushing?

86
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,199
It's—it's my issue.

87
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:35,959
Here.

88
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:36,959
Eat.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,480
Extra salt, extra oil.

90
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,639
That's what makes it tasty.

91
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,319
Let me tell you—

92
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,800
Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

93
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,600
Have a bottle of baijiu.

94
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,319
Clear your head.

95
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,000
Why drink baijiu so early?

96
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,160
I'm just curious.

97
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,079
Just curious, really.

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,759
Let me ask—

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,160
For a funeral for the elderly,

100
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,439
how much do the family get?

101
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,519
Let me help you analyze this.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,399
So you want to have a wedding,

103
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,279
but your husband doesn't want one.

104
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,199
Scumbag.

105
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,120
No.

106
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,920
Because I was the one who firmly said

107
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,199
I didn't want a wedding.

108
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,800
You've got me all confused.

109
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,199
So is it you who doesn't want it,

110
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,120
or is it him who doesn't want it?

111
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,319
Turns out I didn't want it.

112
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Now it's him who doesn't want it.

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,319
Still a scumbag.

114
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,399
That's not really fair.

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,399
Back then, I didn't want a wedding

116
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,480
because I thought

117
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,839
two people being together

118
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,000
didn't need such a big ceremony.

119
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,439
Lili,

120
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,759
you really spoke my mind.

121
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
It's not that absolute.

122
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,279
Because now

123
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,959
I actually want a wedding too.

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,040
You're just being dramatic.

125
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,759
You've matured.

126
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,519
You know

127
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,879
love is precious,

128
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,839
but marriage

129
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,519
is even more valuable.

130
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,199
Take my advice.

131
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,519
We have to follow the proper steps.

132
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,199
If you don't hold a banquet,

133
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,160
your marriage

134
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,399
won't last long.

135
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,079
So my husband,

136
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,160
why doesn't he want a wedding?

137
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
He's afraid of spending money.

138
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,079
That can't be it.

139
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,600
He just thinks it's a hassle.

140
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,160
He also...

141
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,240
You two,

142
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,600
have lived all these years

143
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,920
and still don't understand men.

144
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,759
If a man doesn't want a wedding,

145
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,040
there's only one reason.

146
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,800
He doesn't love you enough.

147
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,439
He still has

148
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,879
other thoughts in his heart.

149
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,759
Other thoughts.

150
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,079
University for the Elderly fitness class

151
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,639
Five hundred per person, buy one get one free.

152
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:56,839
In-law,

153
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,720
the University for the Elderly has a fitness class.

154
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,920
It's perfect for you.

155
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you interested?

156
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,920
How much will you pay me?

157
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,399
Why would you get paid to attend?

158
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,920
So how much does he want?

159
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,560
Not much.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,079
Just pay five hundred.

161
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,079
That's a good deal.

162
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,519
But I don't have any money on my phone now.

163
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,000
With our relationship,

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,279
I'll lend it to you first.

165
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,639
How about this then:

166
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,920
You lend me five hundred for the registration,

167
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,319
then send me another five hundred for living expenses.

168
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,879
I'll pay you back both tomorrow.

169
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,360
Alright.

170
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,839
That works too.

171
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,720
Anyway, we get a free class out of it.

172
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm such a clever old fox.

173
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,080
Pay me back one thousand tomorrow.

174
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,679
You know what,

175
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,039
I was really lucky that day.

176
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,440
Just watch that young guy cast his line,

177
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,759
and with a flick of his wrist,

178
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,480
he caught over two jin of carp.

179
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,360
That made the little grandson so happy.

180
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,320
He'll come again next week.

181
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,080
Where's Cai Xiaoying?

182
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,480
Lao Meng, I'm not coming to class anymore.

183
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,279
My five hundred tuition fee,

184
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,799
you go ask the school for a refund.

185
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,480
And the five hundred you lent me,

186
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,240
I used it to help pay your tuition.

187
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,159
I don't owe you anymore.

188
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
So that's one thousand gone, just like that.

189
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
Here they come, everyone's here.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,639
Where's little Cai?

191
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
I already talked to her.

192
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,840
Tuition is five hundred.

193
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,919
Buy one get one free.

194
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,320
It's perfect for us to split.

195
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:29,799
No.

196
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,639
You already talked to her.

197
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,320
Pay me back one thousand tomorrow.

198
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,960
Pay me back one thousand tomorrow.

199
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,600
Lao Gao

200
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,879
Let's split that class together.

201
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,399
I'll transfer two hundred fifty to you.

202
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,879
Alright.

203
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,600
I'll go sign up right now.

204
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,279
Lao Meng,

205
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,039
trying to outsmart me.

206
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,120
When God spread wisdom on earth,

207
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,159
why did He shield only you from it?

208
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,720
Didn't come.

209
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,879
This woman—

210
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,639
Her heart must be made of coal briquettes.

211
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,320
So scheming.

212
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,879
Class, class—

213
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,840
Let's quiet down, please.

214
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,559
Today's senior fitness class

215
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,879
is mainly to

216
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,279
help all the uncles and aunties

217
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,480
pay attention to your health.

218
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,080
Alright?

219
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,440
Speaking of which,

220
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,720
I regret to share some news.

221
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,120
Last week,

222
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,320
Eighty-six-year-old Grandpa Huang

223
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,559
passed away.

224
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,679
How did he go?

225
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,519
It was very sudden.

226
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,480
But he felt no pain at all.

227
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,960
Who would've thought

228
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
there's a University for the Elderly

229
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,639
with a co-ed tango class.

230
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,080
So Lao Huang

231
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
was spinning and jumping around,

232
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
turning back every two steps, and then

233
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,519
he transferred schools.

234
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,679
Transferred?

235
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,039
Teacher,

236
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,919
give me that university's address.

237
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,320
I'll go scold Lao Huang right now.

238
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,519
He betrayed us for beauty—too much!

239
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,759
Meng—Uncle Meng,

240
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:06,679
Uncle Meng,

241
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,879
I heard that

242
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,200
that class is like this:

243
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,279
the male-to-female ratio is twenty to one.

244
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,039
Sixty grandpas

245
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,559
with three aunties

246
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,440
doing tango.

247
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,240
Those aunties must be exhausted.

248
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,879
On the first day,

249
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,080
they all dropped out.

250
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,080
Now that class

251
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,320
seems to have a new name—

252
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,679
"Sixty Plus Brother Boy Band Dance."

253
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,159
No, Uncle Meng,

254
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,919
he's not going anymore.

255
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,159
Lao Huang changed his ways.

256
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,320
So I don't need to scold him, right?

257
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,679
Alright.

258
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,480
Let's stick to our usual rules.

259
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,159
First, elect a class leader.

260
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,399
Then organize activities.

261
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,200
Anyone want to volunteer?

262
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,879
Me, me!

263
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm volunteering.

264
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,840
Everyone knows me well.

265
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,639
You all know me.

266
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,360
Inside and out.

267
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,840
And I really want to be class leader.

268
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,159
I'll serve everyone well.

269
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,679
Alright?

270
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,320
Good, good!

271
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,519
Good, good!

272
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,600
More than happy to.

273
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,639
Yes, yes.

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,519
Teacher Li,

275
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,440
Sorry,

276
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,759
I'm late.

277
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,879
I'm late.

278
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,080
Come in quickly, come in!

279
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,639
Come, come.

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,919
Sit, sit—Lao Liang, sit down.

281
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,200
Come.

282
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:13,879
Come, come.

283
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,559
Hurry up, hurry up.

284
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,840
Let me introduce someone.

285
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,799
This classmate

286
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,480
just transferred from Tongzhou.

287
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,159
Lao Liang.

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,440
Come on.

289
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,960
Hello, everyone.

290
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,519
Sit here.

291
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,440
Whose daughter is this student?

292
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,399
Pretty and kind, too.

293
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,159
Watch your words.

294
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,279
You're making her uncomfortable.

295
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,879
Exactly.

296
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:32,759
Teacher,

297
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,879
I heard you're electing a class leader?

298
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,399
Yes, yes.

299
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,039
Can I try for it?

300
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,679
No problem.

301
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,399
We elect our leader democratically.

302
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,360
Why should she?

303
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,919
She just got here, knows nothing.

304
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,639
Why should she?

305
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,480
Yeah.

306
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,799
Who are you, anyway?

307
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,799
No—

308
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,399
This—

309
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,399
is a welcome gift for everyone.

310
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,080
Everyone gets one.

311
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,559
Brother Liang,

312
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,600
You just show up,

313
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,759
what did you bring?

314
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,759
Everyone gets one.

315
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,720
It's all organic.

316
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,399
Don't grab.

317
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,200
No—

318
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,879
Don't grab, don't grab.

319
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,200
Isn't this blatant bribery?

320
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,559
It's making the classroom chaotic.

321
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:06,879
Yes.

322
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,919
Why is it so noisy?

323
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,159
Class leader,

324
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:09,759
Leader,

325
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,919
organize everyone, keep order.

326
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,000
Teacher's stepping out for a bit.

327
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:13,639
Alright.

328
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Everyone, be careful.

329
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,039
Um—

330
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:17,639
Uncle Meng,

331
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,159
work with the class leader.

332
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,000
Everyone gets one.

333
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,879
You took two bags!

334
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,639
No, in front of eggs,

335
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,559
does your dignity collapse so easily?

336
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,600
Ms. Li Lili

337
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,399
You have quite a few flaws

338
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,879
Your eyesight isn't great

339
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,159
Among thousands of handsome men

340
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,720
you only saw me, the odd one out

341
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,000
You have no control over your diet

342
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,399
Every time I come home

343
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,919
you always prepare a big meal for me

344
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,080
You have no concept of money

345
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,799
The salary I hand over

346
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,279
you never take it

347
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,360
Sometimes I wonder

348
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,000
did you blow up a nursing home in your past life

349
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,960
so heaven punished you

350
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,720
by making you, this angel

351
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,399
spend the rest of your life with me

352
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,759
Ms. Li Lili

353
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,159
I swear

354
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,159
from this day forward

355
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,759
I will love you

356
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,399
And

357
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,120
I will prove it

358
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,440
with my actions

359
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Mr. Meng Hang

360
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,320
I need to correct you on one thing

361
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
I'm not an angel sent from above

362
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm an S-Star Person from the Fairy Constellation

363
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,840
How did you sleep last night

364
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,480
Not so well

365
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm off to work

366
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:16,960
Your food

367
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,360
Take it and eat on the way

368
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,080
She must've dreamed last night

369
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,720
dreamed I did something again

370
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,679
that let her down

371
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,679
Well, I...

372
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,519
What should I do

373
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,679
I can't go into her dreams

374
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,639
and argue with her there

375
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,440
I have a way to handle this

376
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,960
Would you like to talk to her

377
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,679
Don't worry about it

378
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,600
Leave it to me

379
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,720
Hurry up and eat

380
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
I'm not eating, I'm off to work

381
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320
No, take it and eat on the way

382
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,759
Pretty good-looking

383
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,480
This old man

384
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,080
Dressed like this, he's not proper

385
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,200
I remember Meng Hang had a pair of overalls

386
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,640
Really handsome

387
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,880
How is it

388
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,519
This outfit makes you look young

389
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,839
Looks like you're in your thirties

390
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Super handsome

391
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,039
Like a three-year-old

392
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,759
giant baby

393
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,240
These cards

394
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,799
He needs to draw three

395
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,279
One for your present

396
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,279
One for your past

397
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,200
One

398
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,359
for your future

399
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,680
You played all this when you were young

400
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,319
Exactly

401
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,480
Isn't this just a fortune-teller

402
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,680
Don't talk nonsense if you don't know

403
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
These are Tarot cards

404
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,079
They're foreign

405
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,920
for fortune-telling

406
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,079
That's just worshipping foreign stuff

407
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:57,880
Seriously

408
00:17:59,319 --> 00:17:59,880
Lao Liang

409
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,960
Read my fortune

410
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
See where

411
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,559
I can find my sweet love

412
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,759
You don't need cards for that

413
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,960
That urology ward

414
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,599
That diabetes

415
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,519
All those old men

416
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:08,960
Right

417
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,079
Aren't you annoying

418
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,839
It's bad luck running into you today

419
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,480
So annoying

420
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,039
Fine, read it

421
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,119
It'll be the same result anyway

422
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,680
What's it got to do with me

423
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,359
Uncle Meng

424
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,839
Let me check for you

425
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,240
Can you really predict something special

426
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,039
The Hermit card

427
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,519
The Temperance card

428
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,839
The Knight of Wands

429
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
It's reversed too

430
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,839
Your brow looks dark

431
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,839
Today

432
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,279
you might face a disaster

433
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,880
I advise you

434
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,000
to be careful with your words and actions

435
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,920
Fortune-telling

436
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,559
You even mix East and West

437
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,079
I don't buy your nonsense

438
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,640
Lao Gao, let's go

439
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,160
Let's go

440
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:54,799
Seriously

441
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:56,720
This

442
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,079
What's going on here

443
00:18:59,359 --> 00:18:59,920
My back

444
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,319
Quick, quick

445
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,920
Sit, sit, sit

446
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,400
Slow down, slow down

447
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,480
That's amazing

448
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,920
I told you

449
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,880
I really pulled it

450
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,400
Read my fortune

451
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,440
I really can't move

452
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,200
Almost

453
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,519
This

454
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,519
Read mine first

455
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:12,880
Convinced now

456
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,160
My back's convinced

457
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,519
But I'm not convinced by him

458
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,839
The school was supposed to

459
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,640
call your son

460
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,240
but Meng was busy with a client

461
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,160
so I had to come take care of you

462
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,000
No

463
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,759
You were supposed to push me

464
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,000
Now it's me

465
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:32,920
doing it myself

466
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,759
No

467
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,039
What's this rope for

468
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,960
So you don't get lost

469
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,880
That's humiliating

470
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,440
This is all Lao Liang's fault

471
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,279
Your mouth is vicious

472
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,240
Go online

473
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,279
and troll him

474
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,759
At your age

475
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,119
still playing at school bullying

476
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,359
ruining your reputation late in life

477
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,079
Help me look into him

478
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,759
I'm not going

479
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,759
Do you believe me

480
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,000
Do you believe me

481
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,400
What are you investigating?

482
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,880
Lao Liang is treating classmates to dinner.

483
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,920
Go keep an eye on it.

484
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,720
Help me dig for info.

485
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,400
See if you can uncover any dirt.

486
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,559
If you find something,

487
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,599
I'll make sure he can't leave after school.

488
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,319
You want to start a fight?

489
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,720
Even harsher than that.

490
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,319
Report him to the teacher.

491
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,799
Alright.

492
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,039
Auntie Hua,

493
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,720
Look,

494
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,119
between me and Lao Liang,

495
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,480
who's younger?

496
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,079
Of course, Lao Liang is younger.

497
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Just look at his skin.

498
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,680
Hey, Lao Liang,

499
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,920
how do you take care of yourself?

500
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:09,799
Yeah,

501
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,119
look at his health.

502
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,400
He's fitter than the young ones.

503
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:16,759
Actually,

504
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,480
my son told me not to say.

505
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:20,759
Go ahead, say it.

506
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,920
Everyone, keep eating.

507
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,559
Playing hard to get.

508
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,279
Lao Liang,

509
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,640
we're all

510
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,279
classmates here.

511
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,680
Don't keep it all to yourself.

512
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,559
Exactly, exactly.

513
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,200
Tell us.

514
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,640
Come on, share.

515
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,359
Share, share.

516
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,319
Let us in on it.

517
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,119
No one else, go ahead.

518
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:35,720
Tell us.

519
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,640
I'll only tell you guys.

520
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,480
See this bracelet?

521
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,039
White agate.

522
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
My son

523
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
works in mining.

524
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,799
Two years ago,

525
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,359
he opened a meteorite mine.

526
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,559
Inside,

527
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,039
he found this crystal.

528
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,640
Thought it looked nice,

529
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,279
so he made me this bracelet.

530
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,319
Unexpectedly,

531
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,759
since I started wearing it,

532
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,400
I don't get winded climbing stairs.

533
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,680
My back doesn't hurt anymore.

534
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,640
And

535
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,680
I'm getting younger every day.

536
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:12,759
Quick, tell us!

537
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,319
Where can we buy one?

538
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,079
Yeah,

539
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,200
where do we get it?

540
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,400
This is a national treasure.

541
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:18,640
It's called

542
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,240
"A baiji dolphin in stone,"

543
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,400
"a panda in a mine."

544
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,319
How could it be sold publicly?

545
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,720
Where did you buy it?

546
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,119
Where did you get it?

547
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,400
But

548
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,440
if you really want one,

549
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,440
I can get it for you internally.

550
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,400
Okay.

551
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,319
But

552
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
it's not cheap.

553
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,559
Case solved.

554
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,400
Scammer.

555
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,680
Same style, right?

556
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,559
Let me see it.

557
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,279
What's this called?

558
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,319
Internal documents call it

559
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,119
Baikela Crystal.

560
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,200
How does he know about Baikela Stone?

561
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,880
Baikela Crystal.

562
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
It really does have

563
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,440
rejuvenating powers.

564
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,880
This

565
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,039
should be

566
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,200
a specialty of Titan Star.

567
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,839
I bought one during interstellar travel.

568
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,160
Hurry, tell us.

569
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,200
Where did you find it?

570
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,480
Me,

571
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,720
I was at

572
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,960
You're one of us too.

573
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,160
You're an alien too?

574
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,799
What are you talking about?

575
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,640
The first time I saw your photo,

576
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,880
I knew you were in disguise.

577
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
You want to blend in with humans, right?

578
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,039
You...

579
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,119
What are you doing?

580
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,119
With this crystal,

581
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
we have a chance

582
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,359
to return to our home planet.

583
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,160
Escape this stupid Earth.

584
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,039
That's great!

585
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:51,960
What does he know?

586
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,920
Thinks I'm easy to bully because I'm old.

587
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,200
No.

588
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,039
Yeah.

589
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:54,640
Exactly.

590
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,920
He's got dementia.

591
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,640
She's making it up.

592
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,480
Where are you going?

593
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,200
Wait for me!

594
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,599
Let's not stoop to the Earthlings' level.

595
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,039
Where are you going?

596
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,160
So?

597
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,400
Any luck?

598
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,079
I almost had something.

599
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,319
But he slipped away.

600
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,640
What did you get?

601
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,720
That Baikela thing...

602
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,240
Earthlings don't know anything.

603
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,839
Dad.

604
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,240
Dad.

605
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,680
About Lili's dream—

606
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,200
It's settled.

607
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,480
I guarantee everything will be fine tomorrow.

608
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,079
Back to being inseparable.

609
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,599
That's impressive.

610
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,000
No.

611
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,839
What did you do?

612
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:54,559
Me?

613
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,359
You can trust me to handle things.

614
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,559
I almost had it.

615
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,559
But it got away.

616
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,599
What's going on?

617
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,680
Please forgive my outburst earlier.

618
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,000
Lili,

619
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,240
Even if you had three heads and six arms,

620
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:33,279
even if you came from the edge of the universe,

621
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,359
I would still love you forever.

622
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,759
You'll always be my bride.

623
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:10,920
Meng Hang.

624
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,160
Th-this...

625
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,640
What is this thing?

626
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,279
This...

627
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,599
Th-this...

628
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,680
I told you,

629
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,720
we shouldn't have listened to my dad.

630
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,519
Information found online

631
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,759
I mean well

632
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,839
Helping you

633
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,160
To chase away your nightmares?

634
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,640
You should look up how to ward off yourself first

635
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,039
You are my nightmare

636
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:13,920
Forget it

637
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,920
I shouldn't have longed for a wedding

638
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,519
Forget it

639
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,599
Don't upset Lili again

640
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,680
Forget it

641
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,559
No way this family can fund a trip to Antarctica

642
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,599
No one's eating this bun

643
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,559
I'll eat it then

644
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,160
My back's not good

645
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,039
I need to nourish myself

646
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,480
Why do you look like a tardigrade

647
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,319
No brains

648
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,400
No worries

649
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,640
Who is it

650
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,440
Who's knocking so passionately

651
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,880
Who is it

652
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,039
Knocking so hard, no restraint

653
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,440
Who are you looking for

654
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,039
Move aside

655
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,200
No

656
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,799
You guys

657
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,319
What are you doing

658
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:01,799
No

659
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,839
Who are you looking for

660
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,839
I'm looking for you

661
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,680
You ruined our business, didn't you

662
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,319
What business

663
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:10,839
Still pretending, huh

664
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,039
Lao Liang already told us

665
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,200
If it weren't for you

666
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,519
Those old men and women

667
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,599
Would've taken the bait long ago

668
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,640
Lao Liang

669
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,079
I'm looking for him too

670
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:19,599
Where is he

671
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,880
That Liang guy messed up

672
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
This is our boss

673
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,079
Then

674
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,599
Pass a message to Lao Liang

675
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,640
If there's Baikela Crystal

676
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,759
Send it to me

677
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,240
If not

678
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,680
See yourself out

679
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,200
You refuse a toast, so you get forced

680
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,680
Don't blame me for being rough then

681
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,480
So you want to fight

682
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,279
Me

683
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,000
What the hell

684
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,319
Take anything valuable for me

685
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,640
Smash what you can't take

686
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,480
Son, call the police

687
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,319
Yeah, yeah

688
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
I'm telling you, I'm calling the police

689
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,079
You dare

690
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,039
Hit

691
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:54,920
Th-this

692
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,519
I'll show you

693
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,240
Don't come closer

694
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,079
Back off

695
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:23,839
Back off

696
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,839
You back off, I—

697
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
You're not mad at me anymore, right

698
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,039
Still mad

699
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:46,359
Go away

700
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,559
If you have a problem

701
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:56,759
Come at me

702
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,279
At least you have a conscience

703
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,079
Let me tell you

704
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,440
I know snake fist, mantis fist

705
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,640
Bragging about that?

706
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,799
Let me do it

707
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,680
Freeze

708
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,240
Got it

709
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,519
Open

710
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,039
I'm telling you, I'm tough

711
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,720
I know tiger-crane style

712
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,160
Me

713
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,720
Appearing Dragon in the Field

714
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,960
Flying Dragon in the Sky

715
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,480
Overbearing Dragon Has Regrets

716
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,240
Why are you still mad at me

717
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:56,880
Wedding

718
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,160
Didn't I say we wouldn't do it

719
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,400
That's not what I meant

720
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,359
Let you show off

721
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,440
How is it

722
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,400
It's fine, it's fine

723
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:14,960
Let's go

724
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,640
Are you okay

725
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,359
I want to do it

726
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,279
Do what

727
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,960
Wedding

728
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,000
I want to have a wedding

729
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:26,759
Wear a wedding dress

730
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,640
Walk the aisle

731
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,680
Really

732
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:30,960
Okay

733
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,480
Then let's

734
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,160
Do it

735
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,839
Finish what you were saying

736
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,319
Wedding

737
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,440
Back then,

738
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,079
I started with a "Wild Goose Lands on the Sand,"

739
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,319
then switched to a "Rabbit Kicks the Eagle,"

740
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,559
and spun into a "Great Roc Spreads its Wings."

741
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,240
I took Lao Liang's crew

742
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,680
down completely.

743
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,680
You weren't there,

744
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,160
so it's a shame you missed it.

745
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,720
From the start,

746
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,319
I knew Lao Liang was a scumbag.

747
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,400
Right? Right?

748
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,440
Luckily, Cai Xiaoying exposed him.

749
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,000
Didn't she?

750
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,440
That's right.

751
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,640
I set up Cai Xiaoying.

752
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,960
I arranged it.

753
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,559
I'm the Great Sage Equal to Heaven,

754
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,799
and she's my Brother Sha.

755
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,200
Big Brother is right.

756
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,000
Big Brother said it.

757
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,279
Yes, yes, that's right.

758
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,359
I arranged it.

759
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,640
My son is getting married in a few days.

760
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,279
It's a big celebration.

761
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,039
Everyone, come!

762
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,039
Alright, alright.

763
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:42,960
Don't come empty-handed.

764
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:44,920
Everyone should go.

765
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,640
I've returned to my peaceful campus life.

766
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,839
Uncle Gao, Uncle Meng.

767
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,279
Hello, teacher. Hello, teacher.

768
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,240
Thanks to our hero,

769
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,839
everyone's property

770
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,839
was kept safe from any loss.

771
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,400
That's right.

772
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,839
No, it's what I should do.

773
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,599
It's my duty.

774
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,400
Yes, yes.

775
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,759
We have to thank Uncle Meng.

776
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,279
We must thank Uncle Meng.

777
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:06,839
Thank him

778
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,839
for bringing Auntie Cai

779
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,159
to be with us.

780
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,679
Yes.

781
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,199
Alright, alright.

782
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,119
Well,

783
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,519
it was Auntie Cai

784
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,679
who saw through the scammer's tricks.

785
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,280
She's a hero of our University for the Elderly.

786
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:36,079
So,

787
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,239
we specially hired Auntie Cai

788
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
to be our

789
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,320
Safety and Life Counselor.

790
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,400
Let's give her another round of applause.

791
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Alright.

792
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,480
She became my teacher.

793
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:52,960
From my observation,

794
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,920
many people on Earth don't want a wedding.

795
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:55,880
They think it's too much trouble.

796
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,599
Often,

797
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,239
a wedding

798
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,440
is just a show for friends and family.

799
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
In some places,

800
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,599
there are even bad customs.

801
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,039
I totally support

802
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,079
not having one

803
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:06,880
if you don't want to.

804
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,320
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

805
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,519
But if you're like me

806
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,320
and want a wedding,

807
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,599
just admit it openly.

808
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,320
There's nothing shameful about it.

809
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:14,840
Having a wedding

810
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,199
is one of my

811
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,800
important experiences on Earth.

812
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,199
If it doesn't go well this time,

813
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,480
I'll improve next time.

814
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,840
By the way,

815
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:22,599
this

816
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:24,000
is my wedding invitation QR code.

817
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,639
Earthlings can give wedding cash gifts, no limit.

818
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,000
Just give whatever you feel is right.

819
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:28,679
Thank you.
