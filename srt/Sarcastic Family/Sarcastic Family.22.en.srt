1
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,799
The plating looks okay.

2
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,640
But the taste is weak.

3
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,719
You’re taking this wedding way too seriously.

4
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,080
Look it over again.

5
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,599
Sis…

6
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,039
You made a whole book for tasting?

7
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,680
Of course not.

8
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
Vol. One, Two, Three.

9
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,280
Three volumes in total.

10
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,159
Three.

11
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,800
What’s wrong with that?

12
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,280
I only marry once.

13
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,800
It has to be perfect.

14
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
Right, right, it must be perfect.

15
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,080
It has to be perfect.

16
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Sis, future brother‑in‑law,

17
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
for your wedding,

18
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,840
I have to be deeply involved.

19
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,879
About my proposal last time,

20
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,840
what do you think?

21
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,199
The best man…

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,520
has to be Lao Cha.

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
I met your sister

24
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,719
kind of because of him.

25
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,800
What about my other idea?

26
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,199
Me in drag as a bridesmaid.

27
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Not really suitable.

28
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:57,599
True.

29
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,520
My looks, after all,

30
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,840
might steal your spotlight.

31
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,319
Any other ideas?

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,479
The emcee.

33
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,319
Emcee is fine.

34
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,199
Thanks, bro‑in‑law.

35
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,680
The planner from the wedding company’s here.

36
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,000
I’ll go meet them.

37
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,319
Where are you now?

38
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,680
I’m in the lobby.

39
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,639
You brought all the plans and stuff, right?

40
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,599
Okay.

41
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,639
Have you picked the host yet?

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,719
Thanks.

43
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,520
You’re welcome.

44
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,000
Sis,

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,560
you really love carbs, huh?

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,039
This is the staple I planned

47
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,919
for the wedding, my own creation.

48
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,240
Nine‑grid boiled instant noodles.

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,919
Don’t tell your fiancé.

50
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,159
It’s just instant noodles.

51
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,280
What’s so special about that?

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,000
You don’t get it.

53
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,599
I really don’t.

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,520
I finally gained a big sis,

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,439
but at your wedding

56
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,919
I have zero presence.

57
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,599
Then how about this—

58
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,280
you prepare a little fun act.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,479
You think I don’t want to?

60
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,560
I wanted to hitch onto one.

61
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,599
But where would I hitch on?

62
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:34,959
Oh right, Sis—

63
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,879
I’ve never actually heard

64
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,639
how you and he met.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,879
The two of us…

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,240
The two of us…

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
first met at—

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,920
Let me guess.

69
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,639
Under an eave, hiding from rain?

70
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,199
Or in a library,

71
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,720
grabbing the same book?

72
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,519
Sis,

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,240
don’t tell me it was on a bridge,

74
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,439
you brushed past each other,

75
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,639
and one glance felt eternal?

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,399
At a bar.

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
The beginning of this story

78
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,639
is kind of cliché.

79
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,000
Cliché?

80
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,079
Is this how young people

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,639
all approach work now?

82
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,079
What was Earth’s last rating?

83
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,399
Three and a half stars.

84
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,199
And your proposed rating?

85
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,439
Destruction.

86
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,560
Are you serious?

87
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,800
After just two and a half years,

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,399
you give me that research result?

89
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,120
You’re still on probation.

90
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,319
Whether you get confirmed,

91
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,360
or promoted to senior,

92
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,000
depends on your own performance.

93
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,079
Chief Editor, it’s not that—

94
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,079
I’ve been on probation this whole time.

95
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,720
How long have I been on probation?

96
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,959
You just have to drink.

97
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,319
You need to exercise more.

98
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,879
Without alcohol, you feel empty.

99
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,639
You know what I mean?

100
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,759
You just gotta drink.

101
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,199
Stop looking around.

102
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,279
Sit down.

103
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,639
Listen to me.

104
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,639
Sit, sit, sit.

105
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,680
These past few years on Earth...

106
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,319
have seen big changes.

107
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,959
You need to stay there.

108
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,680
to conduct deeper investigations.

109
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,279
After you return,

110
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,639
you'll be promoted to senior editor immediately.

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
Whether you get a permanent position,

112
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,240
or a salary raise,

113
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,439
depends entirely on your performance.

114
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,560
Do you know what this behavior

115
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
is called on Earth?

116
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,160
Psychological manipulation.

117
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,800
People like me

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,680
on Earth

119
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,240
are called corporate slaves.

120
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,759
We're not even considered human.

121
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,079
What's so great about him?

122
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,360
Right.

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,879
What's so special about him?

124
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,600
He's just a boss.

125
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,360
Yeah.

126
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,079
The kind who just sits in the office all day

127
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,360
doing nothing.

128
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,959
The boss just flaps his lips,

129
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,279
and we have to run our legs off.

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,279
Here.

131
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,839
Cheers.

132
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,319
Uh...

133
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,319
I need to discuss something with you.

134
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
Because right now,

135
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,800
my understanding of scumbags

136
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,839
isn't very thorough yet.

137
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,439
Could you provide me some material?

138
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,439
Share your thought process and such.

139
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,199
I'm not a scumbag.

140
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
If you're not a scumbag, what are you?

141
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
It's you.

142
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,360
Scumbag.

143
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,360
Let's go.

144
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,519
Go.

145
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,360
What am I?

146
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,639
Doesn't matter.

147
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,959
But I know

148
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,319
what you are.

149
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,800
What am I?

150
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,120
You're an angel

151
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,959
sent to Earth

152
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,079
from another galaxy.

153
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,680
He... he's

154
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,680
drunk.

155
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,560
Happens every day.

156
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:19,920
Here.

157
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,040
Look at this.

158
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,519
This menu is hilarious.

159
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,080
There's one called Wormhole Fruit Platter.

160
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,120
When they bring out the fruit platter,

161
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
it's full of worm-eaten holes.

162
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,240
There's another one.

163
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,960
It's called Pandora Noodles.

164
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,600
What do you think you're doing?

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,159
What do you think you're doing?

166
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm warning you.

167
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,080
Put away your shameless male gaze.

168
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,919
If you harass

169
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,519
this dignified lady again,

170
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,759
don't blame me for what happens next.

171
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,120
I didn't do anything.

172
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,720
Go.

173
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,000
Disappear.

174
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,320
Get out of here.

175
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,120
Okay.

176
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,519
I'll... I'll get going then.

177
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:10,919
Go.

178
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,879
So outrageous.

179
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,600
I just couldn't stand by and watch.

180
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,200
He's the absolute scum of all men.

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,559
Hello.

182
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,159
Hello.

183
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,519
Look...

184
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,919
It's my first time in a place like this.

185
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,240
I feel like I don't really fit in.

186
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,600
Can I buy you a drink?

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We could talk.

188
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,519
I have... I have my own.

189
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,679
Bartender!

190
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,879
Another one of the same for the lady.

191
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,960
My card...

192
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,639
It's right here.

193
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,320
No, wait.

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,200
What's right here?

195
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,360
I thought I lost it.

196
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,240
Didn't I tell you to disappear?

197
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
What are you doing?

198
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,600
You...

199
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,840
These are new!

200
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,759
I'm disappearing! I'm disappearing!

201
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,639
I never thought you almost got together
with Lao Cha.

202
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
I didn't expect it either.

203
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,240
Turns out I'm both of their type.

204
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,639
Anyway, my first impression of Meng Hang

205
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,960
wasn't very good.

206
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,720
Our love story

207
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,000
That's right.

208
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
We need to fully understand

209
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,759
the client's emotional experience.

210
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,080
Then

211
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,039
we can provide you

212
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,879
with the most precise wedding planning.

213
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,679
So please tell us

214
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,159
how you two met.

215
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,240
Back then,

216
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,399
I didn't have much dating experience.

217
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,960
Once, after a class reunion

218
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,200
was over,

219
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,039
Lao Cha took me to a bar.

220
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,039
Come on, let's go.

221
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,279
You have to drink.

222
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,639
You need more practice.

223
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,200
If you don't drink, you'll feel empty.

224
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:47,960
You know that, right?

225
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,080
You just have to drink.

226
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,559
Stop looking around.

227
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,559
Sit down.

228
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,960
Trust me.

229
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Sit, sit, sit.

230
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,519
How is it?

231
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:58,720
This place—

232
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,440
Bottoms up, bottoms up, let's go.

233
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,679
Take a deep sip.

234
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,000
What's wrong?

235
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,440
It's my first time in a place like this.

236
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,399
I always feel out of place.

237
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,639
You've had quite a bit already.

238
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,679
Maybe I should head home.

239
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,440
Sit tight.

240
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,320
That's exactly why

241
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,879
you're still single.

242
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,240
Let me tell you,

243
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,480
dating

244
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,879
is like leveling up an account.

245
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,840
You have to play more.

246
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,240
That's how you go from bronze to king.

247
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,279
Don't worry.

248
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,080
I'll be your wingman tonight.

249
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,360
I'll pick two for you.

250
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,200
Look.

251
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,879
There are two right there.

252
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,240
They're pure and pretty.

253
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,600
Really.

254
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,799
I'll take you to try them out.

255
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,679
Keep it down.

256
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,240
Let's go.

257
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Try, try them out.

258
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,720
Go, go, go.

259
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,480
Isn't this a bit much?

260
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,960
You go ahead.

261
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,559
Bro.

262
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,440
Hi, beautiful.

263
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,240
Can you—

264
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,039
Lao Cha.

265
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,080
That cheating friend of yours

266
00:11:59,159 --> 00:11:59,840
is him.

267
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,240
That's your side account.

268
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,440
Stop with the nonsense.

269
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,360
What side account?

270
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,279
They're two real-life angels.

271
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,200
You call them side accounts?

272
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,039
Do you have any manners?

273
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,240
Honey.

274
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,960
It's him.

275
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,279
It's him.

276
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,399
He taught me.

277
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:14,840
What?

278
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
Dating is like leveling up an account.

279
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,039
Open more side accounts to gain experience.

280
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,200
I honestly don't know what it means.

281
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
He taught me all of it.

282
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,679
I—

283
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,799
I didn't say that.

284
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
It was you.

285
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,039
Jerk.

286
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,159
Let's go.

287
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,559
Go.

288
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,639
Your alt account is this good too

289
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,000
Old Meng, I was wrong

290
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,679
I just...

291
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,039
Just take it as me owing you one, okay?

292
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,759
I'm really sorry

293
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,519
Just...

294
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,799
I don't wanna play with you anymore

295
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,399
No no no

296
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,080
Right now I...

297
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,000
Really wanna go home

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,559
Not going home

299
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,480
Pac-Man, Pac-Man, Pac-Man

300
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,240
Go go go

301
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,759
Let's drink

302
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,759
Don't be mad

303
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Be good and drink

304
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,279
No, I...

305
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
Bro Meng, don't do this...

306
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,759
Learned it... from my dad

307
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,720
Only had... a few drinks and you're like this

308
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,399
We still got round two later, Bro Meng

309
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,039
I feel sick

310
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:15,879
You don't... no...

311
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,679
You don't... you don't...

312
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,279
Behave yourself

313
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,279
No way... that...

314
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,279
There's someone over there

315
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,480
Drinking alone

316
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,399
Perfect for rookies like you to practice

317
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,799
Look... look behind you

318
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,720
One o'clock position

319
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,600
One o'clock, turn

320
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
That one o'clock position

321
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,000
Stop messing around

322
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,840
She's been sitting alone since she came in

323
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,759
Go give it a try

324
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,639
You'll do fine

325
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
These past few years on Earth...

326
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,039
Changed a lot

327
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,759
I... I can't

328
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,639
What do you mean can't?

329
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,519
A man should never say he can't

330
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,639
Just treat it as chatting

331
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,519
Improve your communication skills, okay?

332
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,360
We salespeople...

333
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,279
Need to communicate

334
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:56,879
Fine

335
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,440
Okay

336
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,559
I can do it

337
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,320
You're the best

338
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,120
She...

339
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,639
Alright

340
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,120
No...

341
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,519
You know what this behavior

342
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,879
is called on Earth?

343
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,960
Gaslighting

344
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,759
People like me on Earth

345
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,240
Are called corporate slaves

346
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,879
Not even considered human

347
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,159
What's so great about him?

348
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,080
Right

349
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,919
Just a boss, that's all

350
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,919
What's so special about him?

351
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,919
Exactly

352
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,679
The kind who just sits in the office

353
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,799
Doing nothing all day

354
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The boss just needs to say a word

355
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,360
And we break our backs working

356
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,639
Cheers

357
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,559
If you're not a jerk, what are you?

358
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
What am I?

359
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,440
Doesn't matter

360
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,720
But I know

361
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,039
What you are

362
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,600
You're an angel

363
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,399
Sent to Earth

364
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,159
From another galaxy

365
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,480
You're an angel

366
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,320
You're drunk

367
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,000
People like this every day

368
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,200
But about that reevaluation...

369
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,919
Hope you'll go easy on me

370
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:07,759
Right now I'm...

371
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,200
Counting on this little shop

372
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,200
Alright alright

373
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,000
I got it

374
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,919
Go do your work

375
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,879
Buddy

376
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,879
This shop...

377
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:26,919
Belongs to her

378
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,799
Why this shop?

379
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,600
All shops worldwide depend on her

380
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,960
Thanks

381
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,919
Worldwide

382
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,600
And th-there's another one called

383
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,840
Pandora Noodles.

384
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,720
Pretty interesting.

385
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,440
What are you doing? What are you doing?

386
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,200
Rich lady, let me take over.

387
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,960
What are you doing?

388
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,080
Quit that shameless male gaze now.

389
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,799
Come on.

390
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:02,759
Move, quick.

391
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,559
I really can't take it anymore.

392
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,559
He's a disgrace to all men.

393
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,080
Hi.

394
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,000
It's my first time in a place like this.

395
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,960
May I buy you a drink?

396
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,440
Boss.

397
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,519
Same again for this lady.

398
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,120
Wait a second.

399
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,879
My card...

400
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,360
Here it is.

401
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,039
No.

402
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,000
What's “here it is”?

403
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,320
I thought I'd lost it.

404
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,080
Didn't I make you disappear?

405
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
What are you doing?

406
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,399
You—

407
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,840
Anyway…

408
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,600
I was totally out of it then,

409
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,919
no memory of Lili at all.

410
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,759
Then with brother‑in‑law's drinking,

411
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,919
what do we do at the wedding?

412
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,320
It's fine.

413
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,279
Old Zha owes him a favor, right?

414
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,279
He promised to drink for him.

415
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,320
Anyway,

416
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,360
the second time I met Meng Hang,

417
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,600
I realized he really

418
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,080
didn’t remember the bar at all.

419
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,360
He blacked out.

420
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,679
So your second encounter,

421
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,159
had to be somewhere romantic, right?

422
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,039
A trash pile.

423
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,839
That day,

424
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,000
my fever was nearly forty.

425
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,880
On my way back from the pharmacy,

426
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
I saw a man

427
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,279
skulking around

428
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,000
by the trash pile,

429
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,119
brandishing a brick.

430
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,440
He was covered in blood

431
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,720
and tossed down a bloody rag.

432
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,400
When I looked back again,

433
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,519
the man was gone.

434
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Right after that,

435
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,759
I passed out.

436
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,039
When I opened my eyes,

437
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,440
I was in a tiny dark room.

438
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,920
I know—

439
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,920
you were taken hostage.

440
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,240
Then brother‑in‑law showed up,

441
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,279
heroically saving the damsel.

442
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,599
Sort of.

443
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,839
Just one tiny twist.

444
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,440
The guy who “took me hostage”

445
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,559
was actually Meng Hang.

446
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,880
Actually that night

447
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,720
I was going to fight our ex‑boss.

448
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,200
That was our previous company,

449
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,200
a shady employment agency.

450
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,279
He had you call property

451
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,200
to cut their water and power.

452
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,960
How did it go?

453
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,440
Boss,

454
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,839
I don’t think this is right.

455
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,519
The lease isn’t even up yet.

456
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,119
I checked the tenant’s place today.

457
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,559
Someone splashed paint on the door,

458
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,599
wrote a huge “Get out” on it.

459
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,960
I spent ages scrubbing it off.

460
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,960
Why would you scrub it off?

461
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,920
I paid someone to do that.

462
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,279
Isn’t this going too far?

463
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,559
How about I go apologize to them?

464
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,599
At least return their deposit

465
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,960
and their rent, right?

466
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,039
True.

467
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,079
Refund it and be done.

468
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,240
Okay.

469
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,079
I mean I’ll refund you and be done.

470
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,000
You’re useless, can’t do a thing right.

471
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,559
A broke loser like you dares

472
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,920
to act like some moral model.

473
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,960
Get the hell out of here.

474
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,359
Damn boss

475
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,720
I really want to smack you dead

476
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,720
I

477
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,599
I

478
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,279
I was so angry at that moment

479
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,319
Picked up a brick from the trash pile

480
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,519
Went to settle scores with my ex-boss

481
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,319
Just you wait

482
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,519
At that time

483
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,319
A girl fainted

484
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,359
When I went over

485
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,880
She had a high fever

486
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:36,920
Coincidentally

487
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,559
Nearby

488
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,160
I had just taken over

489
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,519
An empty rental apartment

490
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,519
So I took her there

491
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,559
Don't come near me

492
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,440
Come closer and I'll beat you dead

493
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,359
You're awake

494
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,359
Don't get me wrong

495
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,799
I told you not to

496
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,839
I said don't come closer

497
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,319
What are you doing

498
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,079
You're that guy from the bar

499
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,680
Did you hold a grudge against me

500
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,079
And followed me here

501
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,599
The bar

502
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,680
Do we know each other

503
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,319
How forgetful you important people are

504
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,720
I said don't come closer

505
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
What are you...

506
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,720
What are you doing

507
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,519
Drink this first

508
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,319
What is it

509
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,359
Cold medicine

510
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,480
I bought it myself, don't worry

511
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,759
Well...

512
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,559
I'm really sorry

513
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,960
I'm just overly cautious

514
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,599
No no no

515
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,160
I should be the one apologizing

516
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,519
About...

517
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,319
That day at the bar...

518
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,599
Was I really that awful

519
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,519
Did I harass you

520
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,759
Not exactly harassment

521
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,319
So you don't need to apologize

522
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,599
It was your friend

523
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,319
All his fault

524
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,119
He's such a jerk

525
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,640
If I see him again

526
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,720
I'll beat him up for you

527
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,960
Or call him over now

528
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,480
While I'm still feverish

529
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,839
I'll give him my virus

530
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,720
Well... I...

531
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,599
With such high fever

532
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,319
Why are you out alone

533
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,880
Your parents aren't with you

534
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,720
Well...

535
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,359
My dad passed early

536
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,480
My mom...

537
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,200
Is gone too

538
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,079
I'm sorry

539
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,079
Touched a sore spot

540
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,640
It's okay

541
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,480
Doesn't hurt much

542
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,000
That's good

543
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,160
That's good

544
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,160
I haven't asked your name

545
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,240
Meng Hang

546
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,759
Meng Hang

547
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,799
And you

548
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm Li Lili

549
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:21,480
What

550
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,279
Li... Li... Li

551
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,519
Hard to say if you have a lisp

552
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,319
Li Lili

553
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:34,799
Well...

554
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,839
In our line of

555
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,480
work, our phones

556
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,240
all burn through power fast.

557
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,000
So just now it died and

558
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
I couldn't call 120 for you.

559
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:43,880
It's okay.

560
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
W-what line of work are you in?

561
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm a

562
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:48,960
real estate agent.

563
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,519
That's nice.

564
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,160
Nice how?

565
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,319
It's so ordinary.

566
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,440
Ordinary is great.

567
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,240
I just want to be an ordinary person.

568
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,640
You're already very ordinary now.

569
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,400
Really?

570
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,000
No.

571
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:03,920
Not ordinary.

572
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,680
No—

573
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:06,880
that's not

574
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:09,880
what I mean.

575
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,480
You're just... weird.

576
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,680
Weirdly ordinary.

577
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,880
I've studied quite a few earthlings.

578
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,480
Earthlings—

579
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,279
that's a very big-picture term.

580
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,200
I like it.

581
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,359
Humans, I mean.

582
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
They really love to compare.

583
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,400
You compare with him.

584
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,480
He compares with that guy.

585
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,799
Round and round comparing,

586
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:43,920
no one is satisfied.

587
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,720
No one's happy.

588
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,839
But after I've met so

589
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,400
many different kinds of samples,

590
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,119
I realized

591
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,640
some things you think

592
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,880
are totally ordinary,

593
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,680
totally unremarkable,

594
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
are what others desperately want.

595
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
So I think

596
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,079
for an ordinary person,

597
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,480
having a job

598
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,920
and a family

599
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,839
is already pretty great.

600
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,279
Here.

601
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,119
There's only this one bowl.

602
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:15,880
Make do with it.

603
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,079
Thanks.

604
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,480
Here.

605
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,119
This is insanely good.

606
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
How did you make it?

607
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,799
You've never had instant noodles?

608
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,359
Only the dry kind.

609
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,519
I've got

610
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,640
a little trick for cooking them.

611
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,839
Use this secret and it tastes amazing.

612
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,119
So where are you

613
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,160
going later?

614
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,880
I'll walk you there.

615
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,279
Isn't that a bit fast?

616
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,079
I live right here.

617
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,640
It's nice and cheap.

618
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,640
So I misunderstood you.

619
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,880
Otherwise...

620
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,319
I can help you find a place.

621
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,720
Or...

622
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,799
make me another bowl first.

623
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,079
Sure.

624
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,000
After that night,

625
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,000
I really felt

626
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,160
everything wasn't so hard anymore.

627
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,359
What do you mean?

628
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,039
At least I learned to cook instant noodles.

629
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
In a way,

630
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,839
Meng Hang saved me when I was down.

631
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,279
Actually that night,

632
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,920
Lili saved me from making a mistake.

633
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,279
Thank you.

634
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,079
Thanks for letting me take some

635
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
and writing the noodle secret down.

636
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,279
It's under the bowl.

637
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,400
Read it when you can.

638
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,079
Thanks.

639
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,200
Well...

640
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,160
goodbye.

641
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:10,960
Goodbye.

642
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,839
I've always had a pretty

643
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,119
negative view of earthlings.

644
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,519
But I think

645
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,759
you're a good person.

646
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,039
Later I reported that shady agent.

647
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,680
Through Lao Cha’s introduction,

648
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,400
I joined the company I’m in now.

649
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,559
Later Meng Hang

650
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:50,000
really did find me a nice place.

651
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,839
It’s that tiny place from the night

652
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,799
the two of us first met.

653
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,920
Once I finished tidying it up,

654
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,240
it actually felt pretty great.

655
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,039
After that,

656
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,640
I finally worked up the courage

657
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,279
to ask her out for a meal.

658
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,519
Table twenty‑seven, right?

659
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,599
Afternoon tea is half price.

660
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,039
So we met up there.

661
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,599
I thought

662
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,200
it would be like in the movies,

663
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,000
we’d talk and talk, never run out.

664
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,839
We’d have endless things to do.

665
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,160
But in the end…

666
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,960
How’s that place? Living there okay?

667
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:12,799
Um…

668
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,720
ten minutes ago

669
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,720
I literally just answered that.

670
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:19,680
It’s fine.

671
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,839
How’s your new job?

672
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,839
Pretty good?

673
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,759
I’ve answered that three times too.

674
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,119
It’s good.

675
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,440
Good is good then.

676
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,160
Look at those two.

677
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,000
Are they breaking up or what?

678
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,240
Baby,

679
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,640
it’s so obvious, can’t you see?

680
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,319
They’re on a forced blind date.

681
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,319
See?

682
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,400
Totally not into each other.

683
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,880
Not like the two of us.

684
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,519
Right?

685
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,519
Here.

686
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,400
So sweet.

687
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,680
How about

688
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:16,680
we help them

689
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,319
and do their homework a bit?

690
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:24,839
Okay.

691
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,559
Sure.

692
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,960
Yeah, yeah, sure.

693
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,480
Let’s go.

694
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,920
How about I give them more questions?

695
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,000
Like the Riemann hypothesis, you know.

696
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,839
So we can work on them together.

697
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,839
I’m done for.

698
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,880
It’s over.

699
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,400
Li Lili, you’ve studied this so long,

700
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,240
watched so many romance dramas—

701
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,759
why do you blank out on the test?

702
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,319
Meng Hang, you practiced ten tongue twisters

703
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,319
and five comic rap bits before coming—

704
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,599
how can you still not talk like a human?

705
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,000
No.

706
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,240
I can’t let it end like this.

707
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,000
Um…

708
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,519
I booked a car.

709
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,720
Then… see you next time.

710
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,559
Next time?

711
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,440
Exactly which “next time”?

712
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:26,880
Okay.

713
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,200
Anyway, we can hang out anytime.

714
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,200
“Anytime” is code for

715
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,279
“we basically won’t meet again.”

716
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:39,839
Hello.

717
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,599
I’ll arrive at your pickup point soon.

718
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,119
Okay.

719
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,079
I need to go to the place

720
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
across the street to get in.

721
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,279
Goodbye.

722
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:57,880
Li Lili,

723
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,039
do something, hurry up,

724
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,839
or you’ll regret it forever.

725
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,279
Meng Hang…

726
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,279
After the traffic accident,

727
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,640
she started taking care of me.

728
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,960
Little by little,

729
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,440
we went from being friends

730
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,359
to becoming husband and wife.

731
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,640
I think the two of us were meant to be.

732
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,759
That car just had to

733
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,079
come at that exact moment

734
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,000
and slam into her.

735
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,400
Even now, Meng Hang

736
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,599
still doesn’t know what really happened.

737
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,599
So then…

738
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:58,359
goodbye.

739
00:33:59,119 --> 00:33:59,920
Goodbye.

740
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,960
Meng Hang…

741
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,559
What is this?

742
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,840
This is not the ending I wanted.

743
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:39,840
My superpower

744
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,480
Is weakened by galactic spacetime warps

745
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,320
That twist the universe

746
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,159
Time can only rewind ten seconds

747
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,360
I don't have time to pull him back

748
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,559
It's okay

749
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:47,559
I'll wait till he reaches the road

750
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,599
Then I'll call out to him

751
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,079
No

752
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
I can't lose this chance from fear

753
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,000
Li Li

754
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,920
This time I can only rewind five seconds

755
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,079
It's too late

756
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,079
Anyway, it's all wrong turns in, out

757
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,119
What he thought was pure fate

758
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,280
Was all your careful planning

759
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Look at the love you see in movies

760
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,280
It's always “meant to be” by fate

761
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,960
But love in real life

762
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,639
I feel

763
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,840
It's like instant noodles, all flavors

764
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,199
Each one has its own style

765
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,519
And I also think

766
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:07,400
Fighting hard for love

767
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,280
Is nothing to be ashamed of

768
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,880
What matters is doing it with heart

769
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,599
Instant noodle tips from Meng Hang

770
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,800
One

771
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,320
Boil purified water

772
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,320
Add noodles after the water boils

773
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,440
Two

774
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,079
About 150 seconds

775
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,920
Fish out noodles, put in a bowl

776
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,599
For chewiness, rinse 10 sec in cold

777
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,000
Then drain off the water

778
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,000
Three

779
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,079
Low heat

780
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,079
Crack an egg into the pot

781
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,119
Do not stir it

782
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,719
Wait for the egg to set

783
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,320
Four

784
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,000
Add the seasoning packs to the pot

785
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,920
After 30 seconds

786
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,800
Pour the soup into the bowl

787
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,719
Five

788
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
Noodles taste better cooked with love

789
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,239
This dish

790
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,840
Is going to be called

791
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,360
“Every Noodle, Every Detail”

792
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,079
“Forever and Ever”

793
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
This is the surprise I made for Meng Hang

794
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,639
An animated video of our love story

795
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,239
But maybe I should skip it

796
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,480
Instead of glossing and romanticizing us

797
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,920
It's better if we both

798
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,960
Just keep for ourselves

799
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,719
Our private memories

800
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,000
Is your sister still in there?

801
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,599
Yes.

802
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,119
Brother-in-law, I finally know

803
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,119
what I can do for your wedding.

804
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,360
You go first.

805
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,199
After you're done,

806
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,920
I'll say no.

807
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,920
What about the trust between people?

808
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:42,719
Go on.

809
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,320
Listen to me.

810
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,280
I plan to film the whole process

811
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,079
of your wedding preparations.

812
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,480
That's a good idea.

813
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,480
So you agree?

814
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,880
I reluctantly agree.

815
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,239
It's a deal.

816
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,960
On the condition that I'm your MC.

817
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,679
I didn't agree to that.

818
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,880
I already bought the suit.

819
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,679
Actually, before I met Meng Hang,

820
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,880
I was pretty disheartened with Earth.

821
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,599
So...

822
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,440
when my editor-in-chief told me

823
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,559
to give Earth another chance,

824
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,119
I was ready to go over his head

825
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,079
and suggest that Earth be demolished.

826
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,320
But...

827
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,480
I never expected

828
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,039
that because of one person,

829
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,119
I would come to love a whole planet.

830
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,960
In a sense,

831
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,639
Meng Hang

832
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,000
saved the Earth.

833
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,880
I once

834
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,440
heard a saying

835
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,559
that

836
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:34,920
people who fall in love

837
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,400
all become poets.

838
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,960
This next poem

839
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,880
is what I want to read at the wedding.

840
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:42,400
A poem I wrote myself.

841
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,400
Our encounter

842
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,880
was a reunion after the Big Bang.

843
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,559
A love that crossed light-years

844
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,559
was an eternity destined in an instant.

845
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,559
Your gravity

846
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,760
is the speed at which I fly to you.

847
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,840
My orbit,

848
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,679
from now on, has

849
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,199
the curvature of love.
