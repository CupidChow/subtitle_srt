1
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,040
This man is named Meng Hang.

2
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,840
In twenty days,

3
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,640
he will step into marriage.

4
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,719
But

5
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,840
out of love for his wife,

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,719
he’s long since become a husband.

7
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,799
Right now,

8
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,000
he’s like any seasoned husband,

9
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
finding every excuse

10
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,200
not to go home.

11
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,159
What are you mumbling about?

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
Why are you still filming?

13
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,400
Didn’t you say cameras make you tense?

14
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,319
Four cameras will be on you at the wedding.

15
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,879
I’m letting you get used to it early.

16
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,080
Still, don’t film every little thing, okay?

17
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,719
Relax.

18
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,800
I’ve got loads of experience.

19
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,360
I’ll make sure all the footage passes review.

20
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,240
Passes my sister’s review.

21
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,960
I find getting married is like that journey
to the West.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,159
Trial after trial, never-ending.

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,199
Each one harder than the last.

24
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:42,960
Cai.

25
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,919
Good, you’re here.

26
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,240
We’re discussing the pickup route
with your brother‑in‑law.

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,879
Come on, let’s finalize the pickup route.

28
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,400
We leave home, get on East Fourth Ring,

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,319
and reach the hotel in under twenty minutes.

30
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,039
No way, that’s way too quick.

31
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,240
Then what’s the point of hiring the fleet?

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,159
What do you mean?

33
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,000
Here’s what I’m thinking.

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,039
We

35
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,240
split into three routes.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,520
Route one

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,719
heads south,

38
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,759
passes Daxing,

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
loops around to Fangshan,

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,199
reaches Mentougou,

41
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,319
then from due west

42
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,599
advances toward downtown.

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,759
Route two

44
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,719
heads north,

45
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,960
gets to Shunyi,

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,199
pulls a sharp U‑turn,

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,199
strikes straight for Tongzhou,

48
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,360
then from due east

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,599
moves toward downtown.

50
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,879
Well?

51
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,960
Are you getting married or going to war?

52
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,919
It’s a motorcade,

53
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,039
it’s meant for people to see.

54
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,199
You’ve got to let everyone,

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
the whole of Beijing,

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,800
feel how happy I am.

57
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,560
What about the last route?

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,080
That one’s a bit tougher.

59
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,439
They start at Deshengmen,

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,599
take Qinghe, Shahe, up to Changping—

61
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,520
Oh, get lost.

62
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:38,919
What’s that supposed to mean?

63
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,719
No, I mean,

64
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,080
I know that route well.

65
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,159
Let’s just head to your hotel first.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,840
Okay, settled then.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,120
No, wait—

68
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,039
Lily,

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,719
can we

70
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,919
maybe make this wedding

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,639
a bit simpler?

72
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,360
This is already the simplest.

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,319
Any simpler and we cut you out.

74
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,360
That won’t do.

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,800
No, what I meant was—

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,120
Sis, my brother‑in‑law means

77
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,039
you’re being a bit extra.

78
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,680
Hey, Li Cai,

79
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,039
what did you come here for?

80
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,159
Didn’t you call me over?

81
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,039
You couldn’t say this yourself,

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,599
so you needed a mouthpiece, huh?

83
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,800
These are totally Li Cai’s own ideas.

84
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,560
Brother‑in‑law,

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,279
you change your face faster than a page.

86
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,160
Dad, I really don’t get this setlist.

87
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,680
Is it a medley of seven songs?

88
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,839
No.

89
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,480
I’m singing seven full songs.

90
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,519
One by one.

91
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Seven songs.

92
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,360
Isn’t that the time you gave me?

93
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,839
Ten ten to eleven ten.

94
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
That’s one hour.

95
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,680
That’s the whole ceremony time,

96
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,839
not just performance time.

97
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,399
But we already rehearsed everything.

98
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,399
Look, at any wedding,

99
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,560
you need festive music,

100
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
playing in the background.

101
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:50,879
How about this:

102
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,519
you go through your procedures,

103
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,079
we’ll play soft when needed,

104
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,040
and we’ll turn it up

105
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,319
to pump up the mood.

106
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,439
Won’t delay a thing.

107
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,519
It will.

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,160
Why don’t you have your own wedding?

109
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,319
Then you can sing all you want.

110
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,879
What kind of talk is that, kid?

111
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,800
I’m doing all this for you.

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,360
Dad…

113
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,439
I mean it.

114
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,920
Look, my mom’s already found a new partner.

115
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,519
You’ve competed with her all your life.

116
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,079
You can’t lose to her

117
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,560
in the field you’re best at.

118
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,839
Don’t mention her to me.

119
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,079
I get mad the moment you do.

120
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
She went and found that old geezer.

121
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,319
What I mean is,

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,639
if my mom can find true love,

123
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,439
you’re not far from happiness either.

124
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,759
I’m not like her.

125
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,480
I’m fully devoted to my career.

126
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,160
True enough,

127
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,399
I haven’t dealt with women in ages.

128
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,920
That last part is really true.

129
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,240
Uncle Meng,

130
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,279
that’s because you bicker with Aunt Cai daily.

131
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,480
You don’t need any other women.

132
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,399
Oh, right—

133
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,399
is it that you don’t like her?

134
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,319
I like her.

135
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,839
Like hell I’d like her.

136
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:52,879
Listen,

137
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
if she were the only woman left on earth,

138
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,759
I…

139
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,519
I’d rather become a monk.

140
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,959
Cut this part, cut it.

141
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:00,879
This bit won’t do.

142
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,800
Enough, enough.

143
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,680
Stop filming, stop it.

144
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
You’ve really got my mind all messed up.

145
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,399
Don’t you people have real work?

146
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,519
Nothing serious to do?

147
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,560
Honestly…

148
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,040
Suspicious.

149
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920
Aunt Cai…

150
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,040
I'll grow to like her.

151
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,600
I still have one big thing to do.

152
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,920
Auntie Cai.

153
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,040
My brother‑in‑law sent me to ask you.

154
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Did you send that video?

155
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,000
What video?

156
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,160
The one inviting my dad to the wedding.

157
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
I haven't sent it.

158
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,240
Where would I even find your dad?

159
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,279
Then what do we do?

160
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,800
Just tell him I sent it.

161
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,160
Your dad is in Africa.

162
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:42,920
He can't make it back.

163
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
So the in‑law dad can't come?

164
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,120
Why are you eavesdropping on us?

165
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,639
I'm not eavesdropping on you.

166
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,480
You're in my shop.

167
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,040
Which of us is

168
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,439
eavesdropping on whom?

169
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,720
You think I want to hang around here?

170
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,759
If it weren't for Meng and Lili

171
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,959
making out at home,

172
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,839
shoving their love in my face,

173
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,000
I'd grab some “dog food”

174
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,759
Yeah, there's “dog food” everywhere.

175
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,800
You can sprinkle it on them.

176
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's talk business.

177
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,879
Speaking of the wedding,

178
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,720
the two sets of parents

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,040
haven't sat down for a real talk.

180
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,920
Raising Lili all by yourself,

181
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,319
to be honest, has been tough.

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,439
And we're so close already.

183
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,480
So...

184
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,959
we're close, that's all.

185
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,199
There are just some

186
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,279
things we give and take on.

187
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,759
Don't worry what other people say.

188
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,600
W‑w‑what are you talking about?

189
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,639
We—

190
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,600
it's the kids' wedding.

191
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,120
Right.

192
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,360
And you’re talking all this

193
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,519
nonsense, serious or not.

194
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,279
I have nothing to discuss with you.

195
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,319
I, I...

196
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,240
I'm just saying—

197
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,000
I mean, about that...

198
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,439
that...

199
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,040
th‑that...

200
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,959
the dowry and stuff.

201
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,920
Just a token amount is enough.

202
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,399
Dowry?

203
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,360
There’s even a dowry?

204
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,560
What I mean is,

205
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,439
if you must, like one or two thousand...

206
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,040
Two hundred.

207
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,519
Or you could just give a red envelope.

208
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,279
It’s the custom.

209
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,959
But...

210
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,720
Where we’re from, we don’t do that.

211
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,879
Aunt Cai is telling the truth.

212
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,120
If there isn’t, then there isn’t.

213
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,160
That’s what I think too.

214
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,639
I mean, for two people to live life,

215
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,959
being happy together is enough.

216
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,279
Okay, it’s fine, you don’t pay.

217
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,000
Wait.

218
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,240
You just reminded me.

219
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,240
We should probably

220
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,959
talk about the bride price.

221
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,759
Bride price?

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,079
You have that custom there?

223
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,759
No.

224
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,800
But you don’t have it here either?

225
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,639
Let me look it up online.

226
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,319
No, no, no need, no need.

227
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,800
We have it here, we do.

228
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,920
Then we can’t break tradition.

229
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,199
For us,

230
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,680
we follow our own rules.

231
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,040
There’s no dowry.

232
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,519
As for you,

233
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,080
you should follow your rules.

234
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,559
So there has to be a bride price.

235
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,799
That never even crossed my mind.

236
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,759
You only thought about my dowry,

237
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,440
not your own bride price.

238
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,799
You’re really something, you know.

239
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,440
No,

240
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,399
I...

241
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:48,919
That

242
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,600
money,

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,639
I need it to release my album—

244
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,519
Okay, okay, okay.

245
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,320
Gift money.

246
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,799
The gift money is all yours.

247
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,240
Take it as the bride price, okay?

248
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,600
The gift money...

249
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
how many people can we get?

250
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,879
I, I, our side—

251
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,919
I’ll invite about ten tables.

252
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,759
And you, you—

253
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,200
no idea how many from your side.

254
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,519
Good, good, good.

255
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,440
That’s perfect.

256
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,080
No,

257
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,159
it’s not about the money.

258
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,919
Mainly,

259
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,919
it’s to respect your customs.

260
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,320
Yes, yes, yes.

261
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,200
Respect, respect.

262
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,039
Mutual respect.

263
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,879
Usually, for this,

264
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,840
how much do people give in gift money?

265
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,399
Gift money, what gift money?

266
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,399
I just give them a video I edited.

267
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,519
No wonder you have no friends.

268
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,559
Let me do the math.

269
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,320
If

270
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
one table seats ten people,

271
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,360
and it’s five hundred per person,

272
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,600
that’s five thousand per table.

273
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,960
If we have ten tables,

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,200
that’s fifty thousand.

275
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,279
We can have ten tables.

276
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,759
The Meng family also has ten tables.

277
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,759
If we find ten more tables,

278
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,720
we could get 100,000 in gift money.

279
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,360
It’s not like we’re selling tickets.

280
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,080
How can you be sure they all give five hundred?

281
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,440
Exactly.

282
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,519
I can sell tickets.

283
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,399
Li Cai,

284
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,919
you’re actually useful for once.

285
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,720
Da Liu,

286
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,120
it's me.

287
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,840
Some time ago, Old Meng was

288
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,159
singing at your bar, went great, right?

289
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,440
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,919
In a couple of days he has another show.

291
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,799
Not at your place.

292
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,080
There's a special venue.

293
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,840
Right now I've got

294
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,639
uh,

295
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,960
one hundred spots.

296
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,879
I didn't give any to anyone else.

297
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,440
I'm giving them to you.

298
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
You help me sell them.

299
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,080
It's five hundred per person.

300
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,840
Right.

301
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,200
But you have to wire me the money first.

302
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,559
All right.

303
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,639
Deal.

304
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,919
The gift money's in the bag.

305
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,480
Aunt Cai, what do you mean?

306
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,000
Old Meng,

307
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,840
he has to sing anyway.

308
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,879
At the wedding,

309
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,240
it's all noisy and chaotic.

310
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,399
Who can even tell

311
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,759
who's a fan and who's family?

312
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,080
How am I this smart?

313
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,159
No, I mean,

314
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,639
haven't you already saved up

315
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,200
enough to go to Antarctica, back home?

316
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,480
Why do you still want more?

317
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,879
Who ever thinks they have too much money?

318
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,519
I look this good,

319
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,679
can't I upgrade to business class?

320
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,159
Is that not allowed?

321
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,919
Mom.

322
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,799
Li Cai,

323
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,799
let’s have a meeting.

324
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:37,919
Comrades,

325
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,000
friends,

326
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,200
first of all, on my own behalf,

327
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,080
for all your hard work lately,

328
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,559
I want to say a heartfelt thanks.

329
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,120
And for all of you,

330
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,519
for what you have achieved,

331
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,919
I want to offer my warmest

332
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,799
congratulations.

333
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,039
The groom counts as an “official,”

334
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,399
so today’s meeting

335
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,080
is mainly to plug the gaps,

336
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,840
check which little details

337
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,159
have not been carried out yet.

338
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:04,799
Mom,

339
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,879
let’s start with you,

340
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,440
start with what you need to do.

341
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,840
Uh…

342
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
have you written the speech?

343
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Our submission deadline

344
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,600
was yesterday at noon.

345
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,600
There are still a few days!

346
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,720
When the time comes,

347
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,559
I’ll just talk on stage, done.

348
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,080
What did we agree on before?

349
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,639
Have you forgotten our plan?

350
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,080
You should have handed it in

351
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,120
to Lili yesterday to proofread.

352
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,320
Then Lili gives it to me to review.

353
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,960
I give feedback within eight hours,

354
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,320
then you revise it again.

355
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,320
Lili,

356
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,360
he, uh…

357
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,320
well, this…

358
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,240
the, the speech thing

359
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,519
really is very important.

360
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,159
Plus, when you talk normally,

361
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,480
you don’t really filter yourself.

362
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
So better be careful.

363
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,360
Right? Isn’t that so?

364
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,360
Better prepared than sorry.

365
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,399
So about this, um…

366
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,320
you can make up for it.

367
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,600
I’ll give you an important task.

368
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,200
This here

369
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,440
is a key prop for our wedding.

370
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,679
I’m entrusting it to you.

371
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,919
But remember,

372
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,519
guard it from my dad like a thief.

373
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
Why should you say that?

374
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,960
Because you can’t keep your hands off.

375
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,200
I’m just…

376
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,120
fiddling with strings, that’s all.

377
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,080
All right, all right, all right.

378
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,039

379
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,559
Ms. Li Lili,

380
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,440
the wedding hall big screen’s

381
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,519
wedding photo, have you picked it?

382
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,039
I’ve narrowed it down to eight.

383
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,000
Tomorrow I’ll decide on the one.

384
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,879
Which eight? Bring them here.

385
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,919
I’ll pick it for you right now.

386
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,159
All eight are just your solo shots?

387
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,080
You won't let me pick the best one?

388
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,840
Okay, okay, okay.

389
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,720
L-let's talk about this tonight.

390
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,159
Father, Father.

391
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:36,879
Re-rehearsing, I...

392
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm just way too sleepy.

393
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,559
Where are we now?

394
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,639
Is the program list decided?

395
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,039
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

396
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,840
All decided, all decided.

397
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,799
For the opening, we’ll start with

398
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,919
“Endless Love.”

399
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,559
Which is about

400
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,759
recalling the past,

401
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,519
a love-sick pain you can’t forget.

402
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,519
It’s about a breakup.

403
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,200
No, it mainly blesses you, like

404
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
you two get along great,

405
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,720
three lucky stars above,

406
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,039
and wealth in all four seasons.

407
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,600
Right.

408
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,799
Then we also prepared “Afterwards,”

409
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,480
wishing you both a brand‑new life.

410
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,720
That one’s also about a breakup.

411
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,000
It’s mainly to wish you

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,559
j-just, you know,

413
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,159
good harvests,

414
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,000
and everything going smoothly.

415
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,759
That’s

416
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
If this one doesn’t work,

417
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,080
“Ten Years.”

418
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,080
Wishing your love life will

419
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,200
end in heartbreak sooner or later.

420
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,799
No, I mean wishing you

421
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,879
j-just, you know,

422
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,399
lasting forever,

423
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,240
and ten out of ten perfect.

424
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,720
That’s

425
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
what I meant.

426
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,480
If that song won’t do,

427
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,440
aside from the main track,

428
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,919
I only know “I Got Nothing.”

429
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,240
Dad.

430
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
“I Got Nothing” is great.

431
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,720
Look,

432
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,919
Dad, could you please try harder?

433
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,840
I am trying really hard.

434
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,279
I even wrote the links.

435
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:28,799
Li Cai.

436
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,159
I came up with them.

437
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,759
Li Cai.

438
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,039
My h-hair’s gone gray.

439
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,039
Brother‑in‑law.

440
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,360
What are you doing?

441
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,440
I’ve been filming you nonstop.

442
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,720
Who told you to record?

443
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,360
What role did you fight to get?

444
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,039
Host.

445
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
What’s a host’s main duty?

446
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,840
Looking after the bridesmaids.

447
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:42,759
Looking after—

448
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,000
Right.

449
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,840
the bridesmaids.

450
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:45,879
Keke said

451
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,120
she and the other bridesmaids

452
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,240
have agreed

453
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,639
that when you show up,

454
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,879
you must improvise fifty good traits of mine.

455
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,000
Fifty?

456
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,320
You don’t have that many.

457
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,960
You’ve got way more than fifty.

458
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Fifty’s really selling you short.

459
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
Is there anything else besides that?

460
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,200
They also said, um,

461
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,240
they’ll put lipstick on your lips,

462
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,320
Darn it, then kiss “LOVE” on my face.

463
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,559
This is bad, really bad.

464
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,559
Well, there is space for it.

465
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,960
That’s the part that worries me most.

466
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,639
What I’m most afraid of

467
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,639
is the best man and bridesmaids

468
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,919
making trouble during the pickup.

469
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,039
Li Li

470
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
Can we just cancel this whole thing?

471
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,000
Or maybe even cancel the wedding?

472
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,960
No, no, no.

473
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:25,919
Uh, well…

474
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,440
I’m really scared of this.

475
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,679
But everyone else does it.

476
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,480
Other couples all have this.

477
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,000
I’m begging you.

478
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,960
How about this…

479
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,799
Once this rush is over,

480
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
have him write out all your good points

481
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,080
one hundred times each.

482
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,639
All right then.

483
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,080
Then let’s follow our family’s custom.

484
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,279
You come pick me up yourself.

485
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,399
The best man and maid of honor wait there.

486
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,080
Okay.

487
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,000
Settled, then.

488
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,200
Everyone,

489
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,840
remember:

490
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,600
do not mess up at the key moment.

491
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,399
We won’t.

492
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:51,919
And you.

493
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,120
Dad, fix up the program list.

494
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,759
Yes, absolutely.

495
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,360
We rehearse at the hotel the day after.

496
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,120
Comrades,

497
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,679
perk up your spirits.

498
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,919
Let’s do this!

499
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,960
Don’t get too excited.

500
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,039
Get some proper rest.

501
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,720
The countdown starts now.

502
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,039
The wedding is tomorrow.

503
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,960
Aren’t these flowers a bit tacky?

504
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,080
They’re fabric ones.

505
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,799
That’s not important.

506
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,679
The main thing is,

507
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,360
this is all custom-designed by us.

508
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,320
Red and blue make a perfect pair.

509
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,600
So pretty.

510
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:30,639
That’s Lao Meng.

511
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,639
Lao Meng!

512
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,080
Hello, sir.

513
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,080
I’m

514
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,080
Guiying’s husband.

515
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,000
Why’d you drag him out here?

516
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,919
You’re not needed—ship him back.

517
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:44,799
How can you…

518
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,159
What’s this got to do with you?

519
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,159
Of course it’s got to do with me.

520
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,720
I’m here to witness these two kids’

521
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,679
beautiful love.

522
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,879
No need, no need, really.

523
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,480
Their beautiful love’s right here already.

524
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,200
No need.

525
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,120
When I see them,

526
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,360
I can’t help thinking of

527
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,879
me and Guiying back then.

528
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,359
Guiying,

529
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,039
do you still remember?

530
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,599
Back in those days,

531
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,319
you often

532
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,839
came to the acrobat troupe to see me.

533
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:12,799
And I

534
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,680
often went to the dispatch station

535
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,039
to pick you up from work.

536
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,680
Can you two stop flirting here?

537
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,359
If I puke later, who’s to blame?

538
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,000
No, I mean—

539
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,079
when you were at the dispatch station,

540
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,440
we hadn’t divorced yet, right?

541
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,880
All these years apart,

542
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,799
how are you still so clueless?

543
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,720
Can’t you tell what matters now?

544
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Bringing that up now—

545
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,119
is it really that important?

546
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,079
No, I just—

547
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,440
Mom.

548
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,880
Li Li.

549
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,519
Coming, Mom.

550
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,039
This is your Uncle Jin.

551
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,200
Hello, Uncle.

552
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,240
Hello.

553
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,079
Staying at the hotel and all that—

554
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,759
you getting used to it?

555
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,920
It’s fine, really fine.

556
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,759
Well...

557
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,839
He’s just being stubborn.

558
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,960
Don’t worry about him.

559
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,319
He really hopes you’ll come, actually.

560
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,039
Really.

561
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,279
Then I’m relieved.

562
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,319
Don’t worry, really.

563
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,279
I’ll talk some sense into him.

564
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:01,839
Okay.

565
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:02,880
Uncle.

566
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,720
Dad.

567
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,480
Rest for a bit.

568
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,440
We’ll rehearse the tea ceremony later.

569
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,480
All right, all right.

570
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,599
You don’t need to mind them.

571
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,000
Go take care of your stuff.

572
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,960
Then I’ll go check on things.

573
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:11,880
Sure, go have a look.

574
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,799
Okay, okay.

575
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,039
Come on.

576
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,359
Where’s my mom?

577
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,640
Haven’t seen her.

578
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,599
Where’d she run off to now?

579
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Stop filming here, okay?

580
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,279
Go look for her.

581
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,880
Go, go find my mom, go.

582
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,519
Hurry up.

583
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,319
Let’s go.

584
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:33,000
Meng Qianwan!

585
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,079
Stop shouting.

586
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,720
What are you all doing?

587
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,880
We’re here for Meng Qianwan’s concert.

588
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,880
What concert?

589
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:39,960
Aunt Cai.

590
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,200
Didn’t you sell off

591
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,039
all of our wedding seats?

592
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,400
Yes, yes.

593
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,319
Well…

594
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,319
That “concert” is tomorrow.

595
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,640
We always arrive a day early for concerts,

596
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,119
sing all night first to warm up.

597
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,720
No, listen, sir—

598
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
this “concert,” see,

599
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,920
it’s a themed concert.

600
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
Wedding themed.

601
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,279
You guys

602
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,440
just pretend to be the bride’s relatives

603
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,519
coming to offer blessings.

604
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,880
Got it?

605
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,720
Got it.

606
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,759
What’s your name?

607
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,279
I’m Cai Xiaoying.

608
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,039
Blessings to Cai Xiaoying and Meng Qianwan,

609
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,960
may you share a hundred years of love,

610
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,240
forever of one heart,

611
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,680
and soon bear a noble son!

612
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,319
What nonsense! Stop yelling that.

613
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,000
Out, out, out!

614
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,720
Everyone out, out, out!

615
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,319
Why should we?

616
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,039
We paid 1,808 for these tickets!

617
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,279
Why are you kicking us out?

618
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,519
How much?

619
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
1,808.

620
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
Aunt Cai, you got scalped.

621
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,519
I’m betting it was Big Liu.

622
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,960
Face value was only five hundred.

623
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,039
Big Liu is so shady.

624
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,160
The concert’s canceled.

625
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,920
Whoever sold you tickets, go find them.

626
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,960
How is that fair?

627
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,440
We came from so far away.

628
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,599
You just cancel like that?

629
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,599
But the tickets Big Liu gave us—

630
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,480
Coming to me won’t help you.

631
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,319
Right? We just—

632
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,759
Meng Qianwan, where are you going?

633
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,759
Aunt Cai, run!

634
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,279
Mom!

635
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:06,799
We’ve been looking for you.

636
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,680
Rehearsal time, let’s go.

637
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,240
Let’s go.

638
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,319
Next is serving tea to both parents.

639
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,640
Go ahead, serve.

640
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,240
Mom, have some tea.

641
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,160
Tea keeps me awake.

642
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,079
Drink, drink.

643
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:21,559
Mom—

644
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,759
You have to drink this.

645
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,359
Mom, drink the tea.

646
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,279
You owe a red envelope tomorrow.

647
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,519
I know, I know.

648
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,480
It’s rehearsal, stand in for me.

649
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,839
Thank you, thank you.

650
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,079
Um…

651
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,119
A-are you thirsty?

652
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,559
What are you doing?

653
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,200
Someone’s in your seat.

654
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,519
I can see that.

655
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,160
This is the groom’s father’s seat.

656
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,359
Why are you sitting here?

657
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,039
Get up.

658
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,400
Old Meng.

659
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,400
No need to blow up over this.

660
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,599
He’s taken my seat completely.

661
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,319
And that’s “no big deal”?

662
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,200
How is this not a big deal?

663
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:08,880
You’re partly to blame too.

664
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,039
Where did you go?

665
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:10,559
I…

666
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,279
I was over there.

667
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,559
I was getting tomorrow’s music ready.

668
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,680
My band needs me.

669
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,480
If they need you, go then.

670
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,119
Is this chair custom‑made for you?

671
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,119
We all have to wait for you?

672
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:18,920
Guiying…

673
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,079
Since big brother is back now,

674
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,759
I’ll just let him have the seat.

675
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,640
You’re not going anywhere.

676
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:25,440
Sit down.

677
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:29,920
You can sit here,

678
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,880
but if I perform, he performs too.

679
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,200
He can walk a tightrope for everyone.

680
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,359
And jump through a ring of fire.

681
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,279
You can just go straight to that…

682
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,480
swallowing a Green Dragon Crescent Blade.

683
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,960
Tomorrow

684
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,200
I’ll get you a real Green Dragon Crescent Blade.

685
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,240
You’ve pissed the kids off; they left.

686
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,960
Because you were the one making a scene.

687
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,519
Making a scene?

688
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,519
It’s fine.

689
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,200
Let them blow off steam today.

690
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,559
Tomorrow it’ll be fine.

691
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,079
Don’t be mad at your mom.

692
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,640
I’m not mad at her.

693
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,359
Then don’t be mad at your dad either.

694
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,200
I’m not mad at my dad either.

695
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,319
Then what is it?

696
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,160
Last night my dad got really drunk

697
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,680
and told me a lot about the past.

698
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,440
Back then,

699
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,759
my dad loved to mess around.

700
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,119
With his good‑for‑nothing buddies,

701
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,480
drinking, singing, playing cards,

702
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,519
gone all day and all night.

703
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,000
I had a fever over thirty‑nine.

704
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,119
My mom took me to the hospital alone,

705
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,000
stayed with me all night.

706
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,279
And my dad?

707
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,759
He was drunk.

708
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,519
He went to the wrong home.

709
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,039
He ended up at the neighbor’s,

710
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,799
slept on the young couple’s bed all night.

711
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,079
They called the police.

712
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,000
My mom even went to the station

713
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,319
to bring him back.

714
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,640
I know my dad.

715
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,480
He wants me and my mom to make up,

716
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,519
but he just can’t say it.

717
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,599
They both really love you, actually.

718
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,480
I know.

719
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,839
Just now, I…

720
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,559
did I go a bit too far?

721
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,759
That weird temper of yours,

722
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,400
only I can put up with it.

723
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,640
Yeah,

724
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,519
this temper of mine…

725
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,200
It’s just that

726
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,960
I got carried away talking.

727
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,680
So, uh…

728
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,400
how about

729
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,799
you go to Old Meng

730
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,880
and apologize for me?

731
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,000
Forget it.

732
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,200
I’m the center of the conflict now.

733
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,480
I’ll just skip tomorrow’s event.

734
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,359
That might be best.

735
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,000
I’m really sorry.

736
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,720
Sorry about this.

737
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,920
Hanghang, don’t you worry.

738
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,279
Um, Uncle Jin just won’t come tomorrow.

739
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,039
Yeah, that’s right.

740
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,400
Tomorrow I’ll

741
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,079
just happen to catch a cold,

742
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,960
with a terribly, terribly bad headache.

743
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,519
Uncle Jin,

744
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,839
you still have to come tomorrow.

745
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,839
You, my mom and my dad,

746
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,920
and Lili’s mom,

747
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:44,880
you all sit at the main table.

748
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,119
That…

749
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
wouldn’t really be proper.

750
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,680
Your dad won’t like it.

751
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,559
It’s my wedding, I decide.

752
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,640
Mom,

753
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,720
let’s finish rehearsing

754
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,079
the tea ceremony first.

755
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,000
Let’s go.

756
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,960
Uh…

757
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:04,880
Come on, let’s go, Uncle.

758
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:05,960
This is…

759
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,920
Let’s go.

760
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,079
I truly am sorry.

761
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,720
It’s fine. Isn’t this better?

762
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:25,880
Brother Meng

763
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,160
I never even meant to join in

764
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,039
that tea ceremony part

765
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,519
It was only because you weren't here

766
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,799
They

767
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,359
asked me

768
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,000
to help run through it

769
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,680
I'm not mad at you

770
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:44,799
I'm mad at her

771
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,720
All claws and fangs

772
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,920
For no reason at all

773
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,559
She’s not usually like that

774
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,720
She’s normally very reasonable

775
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,039
That’s all an act

776
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,279
She fakes it really well

777
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
Or why else would I divorce her

778
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,799
Wasn't it because

779
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,480
she didn’t want you anymore

780
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,559
No, you

781
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,160
You came all the way from Australia

782
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,759
just to gross me out, right

783
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,039
No, no, no

784
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,519
It seems

785
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,720
I was wrong

786
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,279
Actually

787
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,400
not getting married is quite nice

788
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,359
What business are you in, brother

789
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,000
I’m not in business

790
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,839
These are my old

791
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,079
buddies and brothers

792
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,880
We started a band

793
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,400
We want to put out an album

794
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
Hello, hello

795
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,759
Hello

796
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:39,920
I’m so jealous

797
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,279
To be honest

798
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,599
I wanted a band when I was young too

799
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,759
But no one around me liked it

800
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,160
Alone

801
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,200
you just can’t keep it up

802
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,000
Right

803
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,119
You need like-minded people

804
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,960
Otherwise you really can’t play

805
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,559
Yes, yes

806
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,440
Right

807
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,640
Right

808
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,759
Long time no see

809
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,799
You two know each other

810
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,039
Come on, come on

811
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,440
Come on, have one, have one

812
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:09,839
Have one

813
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:10,599
Sing one

814
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,000
Can’t

815
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,359
Come on

816
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,519
Sing one song

817
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,880
My throat can’t do it

818
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,519
Singing’s not about throats, it’s fine

819
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:19,079
I’m like that one

820
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,440
I’m like a

821
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,519
firebird

822
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,079
silently

823
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,319
burning

824
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,039
I want to sing that

825
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,119
You sing it great

826
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,319
that ballad

827
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,240
Join our band

828
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,079
Listen, I’ll give you lead vocal

829
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,920
Accompany me to the ends

830
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,000
Accompany you to the ends

831
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,160
of the earth

832
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,799
How’s that

833
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,480
Li Li, open up

834
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
I’ve come to pick you up

835
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,559
Li Li

836
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,920
Give a red envelope

837
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,480
Li Li

838
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,519
Take the money, Li Li

839
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,160
Li Li

840
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,000
Li Li

841
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,319
Li Li

842
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,240
Open the door

843
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,720
Li Li, I truly want to marry you

844
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,119
What if she won’t open up

845
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,119
What else can you do

846
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,680
Go in yourself

847
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
No need for red envelopes

848
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,240
Li Li

849
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,359
Li Li

850
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,079
Li Li

851
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:46,839
Li Li

852
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,079
Li Li

853
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,640
Li Li

854
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,880
Li Li

855
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,759
Brother-in-law

856
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,680
No one’s inside

857
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,680
How important a wedding is to a woman

858
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,880
is way higher than it is to a man.

859
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,359
Take me, for example.

860
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,119
Chances are I will wear a gown once in life.

861
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,640
But Meng Hang wears a suit and tie every day.

862
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,480
So how could he value it that much?

863
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,039
Every morning he puts on a suit

864
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,160
and smiles at all kinds of people all day.

865
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
If the last deal falls through,

866
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,880
that’s just another normal day for him.

867
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,480
If you ask me,

868
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,200
if you want a wedding to feel sacred,

869
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,920
both men and women should wear gowns.

870
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,960
That way,

871
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,839
women can cherish that day all their lives,

872
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,480
and men can be nagged about it forever.
