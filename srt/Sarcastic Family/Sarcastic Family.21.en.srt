1
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,280
How does this outfit look?

2
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,240
Quit selling houses, selling insurance now?

3
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,360
What's up with you today, Meng?

4
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,919
So jumpy since early morning.

5
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,159
My mother‑in‑law is coming.

6
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,400
Lao Meng, that ugly mug, remarried?

7
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,520
No.

8
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,479
It's Meng Meng's birth mom.

9
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,159
She heard we're getting married.

10
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,000
She's coming to check on us.

11
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,080
Curtains are washed.

12
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,919
Sofa's wiped.

13
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,159
TV stand's wiped down.

14
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
The floor's all mopped.

15
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,199
Mom.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,240
You're dropping crumbs eating.

17
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,800
I just mopped this floor.

18
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,240
If you don't shout,

19
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,800
how would I fall to the floor?

20
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,199
I was just—

21
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,840
Meng Meng.

22
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,759
Meng Meng.

23
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,919
I think you're a bit too nervous now.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,439
I know you want your mom

25
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,479
to see you're doing well,

26
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,479
so she can relax.

27
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,479
But you're already perfect now.

28
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,840
I do want her to see

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,800
that I'm doing great.

30
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,800
But not to put her at ease,

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,400
it's to make her feel bad.

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Why would you?

33
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,599
She abandoned me back then.

34
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,599
Sit down, would you?

35
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,639
I'm getting dizzy.

36
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,000
You go.

37
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
You go on.

38
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,639
You go.

39
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,400
Let's go together, together.

40
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,360
Come on, let's go, go.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,439
You open it.

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,680
Go on, open it.

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,400
You open it.

44
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,639
It's your mom.

45
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,319
You open it.

46
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,599
Delivery.

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,280
Thanks.

48
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,360
Delivery.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,600
Why deliver it right now?

50
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,360
Who is it?

51
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,160
Meng Hang?

52
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,959
Meng Hang.

53
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,240
Meng Hang.

54
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,480
Meng Hang.

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,519
Meng Hang.

56
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,160
Auntie.

57
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,000
Hello, Auntie.

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,040
Let me carry that for you.

59
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,399
This little maid is so polite.

60
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
No, Auntie—

61
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,079
I'm Meng Hang's wife.

62
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
My name is Li Lili.

63
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,480
Lao Meng posted on Moments,

64
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,879
said his son married a rich heiress.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,519
So that’s you?

66
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Sorry, Auntie,

67
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,600
to disappoint you.

68
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,800
It's fine, it's fine.

69
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,680
Well…

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,639
Lao Meng is just like that,

71
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,639
so vain.

72
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,279
When he dated me back then,

73
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,600
he told everyone

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,639
I was a flight attendant.

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,000
In reality,

76
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,040
I was just a bus conductor.

77
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,639
This girl,

78
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,360
she looks pleasing.

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,920
Face like a bright full moon,

80
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,120
wealth is coming to this home.

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,079
At a glance,

82
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,360
she clearly brings luck to her man.

83
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,279
Thank you, Auntie.

84
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,240
Let’s go inside and talk.

85
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:20,800
Let’s go.

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,279
Go on.

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,519
Hurry, get inside.

88
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:30,959
Go.

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,279
This place has changed a lot.

90
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,399
Yeah.

91
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,480
When we got married,

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,639
we had it redecorated.

93
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,079
Meng Hang, show Auntie around.

94
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,120
Go on.

95
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,319
Aren't you best at showing houses?

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,879
Good

97
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,759
Good, yes

98
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,519
This

99
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,199
Many old items are still here

100
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,639
This... this isn't

101
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,519
The birdcage is still here

102
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,959
Back then we used it

103
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,959
To dry Hanghang's diapers

104
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
Good ventilation

105
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,920
Dried very quickly

106
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,759
Right

107
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,160
Auntie, please sit

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
You

109
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,839
Live with your father?

110
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Where is he?

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,279
He's away performing these days

112
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,399
Still rolling

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,199
Rolling

114
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,839
Always rolling

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
Rolls really well

116
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,000
Hanghang

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,839
These years

118
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,040
How have you been?

119
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,000
Still alive anyway

120
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,279
You guys

121
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:58,800
Talk

122
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,279
I'll take a conference call

123
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,319
Well

124
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,199
Auntie

125
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't take it to heart

126
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,120
Meng Hang, he

127
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,040
I don't blame him

128
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,399
I don't blame Hanghang

129
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,079
During the divorce

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,920
I was young and foolish

131
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,600
Left Hanghang with his father

132
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,639
Now that I'm older

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,560
Regret comes too late

134
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,360
The child and I

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,680
Have become complete strangers

136
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,439
You're Hanghang's wife

137
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,759
Seeing you today

138
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,519
Feels very close

139
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,360
Really

140
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,800
Really, I remember

141
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,480
Right

142
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,439
Why

143
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,120
Why are you avoiding me?

144
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:44,879
No, auntie

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Well

146
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,720
I've heard some stories about you

147
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,160
Don't need to ask

148
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,319
Must be Lao Meng badmouthing me

149
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,920
Let me put it this way

150
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,199
Auntie, I

151
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,639
Though quick-tempered

152
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,720
Always persuade with virtue

153
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,240
Like that time

154
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,639
Fought four thugs

155
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,759
That was because

156
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,199
They whistled at me first

157
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,279
Haven't heard this part

158
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,000
Then what?

159
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,279
What happened was

160
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,240
Orthopedic hospital near BBQ place

161
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,920
Got four patients in one day

162
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,000
Those thugs

163
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,680
Should thank me for knowing law

164
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,160
I could precisely judge

165
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,439
Between self-defense

166
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,199
And excessive defense

167
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,079
Auntie

168
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,600
You're too fierce

169
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,839
You think I want to be?

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,320
Who doesn't want a man

171
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
To cherish and protect them

172
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,159
But

173
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,799
Not every man

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,440
Is like Ken Takakura

175
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,080
Giving enough sense of protection

176
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,080
So

177
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,480
Can only rely on myself

178
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,120
Forcing us roses

179
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
To become tough

180
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,080
Auntie

181
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,120
You're truly the strong heroine type

182
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,360
Why still call me auntie?

183
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,799
You should call me mom

184
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,919
You

185
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you dislike me too?

186
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,200
No, no

187
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:03,759
No

188
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,799
Mom

189
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,759
Mom

190
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,559
Good child

191
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,600
Daughter-in-law

192
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,639
Mom, mom, mom

193
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,519
Good child

194
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,279
Good child

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,360
Really?

196
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,000
How fancy.

197
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,639
This white looks perfect on you.

198
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,159
Is it too long?

199
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,639
No.

200
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,240
Not long, not at all.

201
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,600
I'll pair it with a belt later.

202
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,080
Exactly.

203
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:35,840
Looks good.

204
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,919
This cinching, right?

205
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes yes, this looks great.

206
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,000
Really beautiful.

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,039
Thanks for the gift, Mom.

208
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,240
Mom bought it.

209
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:44,960
Does it look good?

210
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,240
I bought you a suit.

211
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,200
For the wedding day.

212
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,679
Try it on for fit.

213
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,679
I don't wear suits.

214
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,919
Why not wear a suit for wedding?

215
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,919
Changed to Chinese style.

216
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,600
When did you change?

217
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,759
Just now.

218
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
You can change but I can't?

219
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,360
Look.

220
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,279
No.

221
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,720
I just talked with Mom.

222
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,279
She regrets leaving you.

223
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,480
But she had her reasons.

224
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,559
I think it's not that serious.

225
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,120
You call her Mom now.

226
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,240
Then what do I call her?

227
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,159
I'll call her sis.

228
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,039
You two enjoy your bond.

229
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,240
I'm going to the pet store.

230
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,399
To feed the dogs.

231
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,919
It's fine.

232
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,759
Don't mind him.

233
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,840
He'll be fine soon.

234
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,639
He doesn't need to try this suit.

235
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,480
Mother-son connection.

236
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,200
You bought it.

237
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,799
It must be his size.

238
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,440
Ignored him before.

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,759
Now pretending to care?

240
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,759
You little rascals.

241
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,399
You're five months old.

242
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,879
Still nursing by mom.

243
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,639
Showing me motherly love?

244
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,279
Is that so?

245
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,000
Look.

246
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,440
See?

247
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,120
You're...

248
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,759
Why mad at puppies?

249
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,679
I'm not mad at them.

250
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,600
Then who?

251
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,840
It's Lili and her mom.

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,879
Did I offend you?

253
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,360
No, not you.

254
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,120
Then who?

255
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,919
Lili's mother-in-law.

256
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,159
Lili's mother-in-law.

257
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,480
Just say it's your mom.

258
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Wouldn't that be easier?

259
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,600
I know about this.

260
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,399
Lili told me.

261
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,679
I thought to close early.

262
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,000
Go see her.

263
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,799
Don't bother.

264
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,919
Nothing worth seeing.

265
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,279
Heard your...

266
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,639
Mother-in-law relations are bad.

267
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,519
Maybe they're fighting now.

268
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,799
I should go check.

269
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,879
What a scene.

270
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,799
Don't worry.

271
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,399
They won't fight.

272
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,440
They get along fine.

273
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,759
Rest assured.

274
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm here.

275
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,639
Don't.

276
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,600
Don't really fight now.

277
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,519
You...

278
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,159
Where is she?

279
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Where is this place?

280
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,159
The scenery is gorgeous.

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,120
This is Australian Hunter Valley Forest.

282
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,519
What are you two chatting about?

283
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,679
Your wife is laughing so happily.

284
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,879
She’s definitely badmouthing me.

285
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,879
I went there as a volunteer

286
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,159
and joined the on-site cleanup.

287
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,320
I saw so many burned to death,

288
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,679
koalas and kangaroos.

289
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,000
I realized

290
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,879
a kangaroo mom, until the fire took her,

291
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
still desperately shielded

292
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,840
her baby in her pouch.

293
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
And those koalas,

294
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,679
they would rather burn to death

295
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,759
than abandon their joeys and run.

296
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,600
At that moment

297
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
I just broke down inside.

298
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,799
I felt that I

299
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,559
was not even as good as them.

300
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,080
After that,

301
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,159
whenever I see koalas or kangaroos,

302
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,960
I think of Hanghang.

303
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,159
Told you.

304
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,600
They never have anything nice to say.

305
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,360
Thinking of kangaroos and koalas

306
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,480
makes her think of me.

307
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,960
Why?

308
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,840
She must think I was too naughty.

309
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,360
Always jumping all over the place.

310
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,000
See?

311
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,200
Her warmth is totally an act.

312
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,759
She doesn’t like me at all.

313
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,440
Makes sense.

314
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,120
Oh, right.

315
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,320
I asked for your birth date and time.

316
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:34,440
They said you

317
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,879
are “lacking Metal” in destiny.

318
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,039
So I bought you

319
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
a gold bracelet.

320
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,320
Put it on.

321
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,799
This looks so beautiful.

322
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:44,720
Do you like it?

323
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,639
I do, I really do.

324
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,519
Thank you, Mom.

325
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,159
To be honest,

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,919
before this,

327
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
I never really felt much motherly love.

328
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,279
But the moment I saw you,

329
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,799
I felt especially close to you.

330
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,080
From now on, treat me as your own girl.

331
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,679
And I’ll treat you as my own mom.

332
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,480
Already calling the thief “mother,” huh.

333
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
Mom, why are you back?

334
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,399
I came back early.

335
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,679
Am I interrupting?

336
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,840
That's not what I meant.

337
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,039
Let me introduce you.

338
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,559
This is...

339
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,200
No need.

340
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,639
This is the bride.

341
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,919
Hello, co-mother-in-law.

342
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,000
You're wrong.

343
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,399
How am I the bride?

344
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Lili is the bride.

345
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm not wrong.

346
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,639
You're her newly recognized mom.

347
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,960
What are you saying, Mom?

348
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,960
Co-mother-in-law is so humorous.

349
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,480
No wonder Lili is so witty too.

350
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,440
Co-mother-in-law.

351
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,879
I really envy you.

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,279
Having such a good child.

353
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,000
If you like her, take her.

354
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll give you 20% off.

355
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,200
Mom.

356
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,039
Co-mother-in-law.

357
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,159
You're so beautiful.

358
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,200
Such grace.

359
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,039
Such a figure.

360
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,080
And so stylish.

361
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,799
Yes.

362
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,600
You're quite stylish too.

363
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,559
Nice essential oil balm. Where'd you get it?

364
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,039
Essential oil balm.

365
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:52,960
Um...

366
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:53,600
Mom.

367
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,000
We're going shopping.

368
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,679
Want to come?

369
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,879
Let's go together.

370
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,960
Then I'd feel like a third wheel.

371
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,480
We're going then.

372
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,279
Let's go, go, go.

373
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,159
That's just how my mom is.

374
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,919
Go, go, go.

375
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,799
I'll be back soon.

376
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,080
Hurry, hurry.

377
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,960
It's fine, it's fine.

378
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,159
That's just how she is.

379
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,440
See? See?

380
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,639
They're arm in arm.

381
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,080
Your wife, from childhood to now,

382
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,440
has never treated me like this.

383
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,480
Ungrateful.

384
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,679
I'm always so good to her.

385
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,519
For example...

386
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,200
First...

387
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:40,200
My usual attitude toward her...

388
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,480
Let's not...

389
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,159
talk about attitude.

390
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,320
Let's just say...

391
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,440
my...

392
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,200
care for her.

393
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,320
Never mind the care.

394
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,240
Let's just say...

395
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,519
my...

396
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,360
tolerance of her.

397
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,039
Why are you humming? Huh?

398
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,039
I accepted her marrying you.

399
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,519
Isn't that tolerant enough?

400
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,360
Get out.

401
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,559
I can't stay on Earth anymore.

402
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,960
I've only been here a short while,

403
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,159
and already learned human fickleness.

404
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,840
It's so late, why aren't they back?

405
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,960
Living on Australian time.

406
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,639
We're back.

407
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,000
Back.

408
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,279
Couldn't you coordinate outfits?

409
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,839
You're twinning.

410
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,200
Mom, these are mother-daughter outfits.

411
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,640
Mom.

412
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,680
I suggested buying them.

413
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,559
I always saw people wear them as a kid.

414
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,279
Never got to wear them growing up.

415
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,839
Making up for that regret now.

416
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:22,960
Meng Hang

417
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,200
Mom bought one for you too.

418
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,759
See? You’re in Mom’s heart.

419
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,279
I-I don’t want it.

420
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,920
So I’m just the extra one.

421
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:33,880
Co-mother-in-law,

422
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,519
I bought you a sleeveless vest.

423
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,519
At our age, it’s easy to catch cold.

424
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,839
We must keep ourselves warm.

425
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,279
Exactly.

426
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,519
My “little padded jacket” for years

427
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,680
has been “worn away” by someone else.

428
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,160
Of course I feel cold now.

429
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,599
It’s okay.

430
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,160
Co-mother-in-law,

431
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,119
try it on.

432
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,359
It looks really nice.

433
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,799
Go inside, go on in.

434
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,680
Meng Hang, I’ll put this in your room.

435
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,799
You’ve talked all day and still are.

436
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,680
How can you have so much to say?

437
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,400
If you’re curious, go listen.

438
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,400
I don’t care at all.

439
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,720
You’re funny.

440
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,160
Mom,

441
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,519
thank you.

442
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,480
Growing up,

443
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,880
my own mom never bought me things.

444
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,160
You let me feel what it’s like

445
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,200
to be a child treasured by a mother.

446
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,480
Good girl.

447
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,680
From now on,

448
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,119
whenever you want motherly love,

449
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,440
just come to Mom for it.

450
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,759
Mom’s got more than enough.

451
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,759
I’ve lacked love for over twenty years.

452
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,759
Now I’ve got a buffet of mother’s love.

453
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Actually,

454
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,880
there’s someone else

455
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
who also really lacks a mother’s love.

456
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
I want to give it,

457
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,519
but he won’t take it.

458
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:00,960
I came this time

459
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,359
just to see if he’s doing okay.

460
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,240
Now that I see

461
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,279
he has someone as great as you,

462
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,960
I’m relieved.

463
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,240
I’ve bought my plane ticket.

464
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,359
I’ll fly back the day after tomorrow.

465
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,079
Without me around,

466
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,319
he might be a bit happier.

467
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,559
Mom,

468
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
these osmanthus cakes,

469
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,359
he ran across half the city to buy.

470
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:30,400
No one at home

471
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
actually likes eating them.

472
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:32,960
I guess

473
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,359
they weren’t bought for us.

474
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,839
He bought them

475
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,480
because I love them.

476
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,000
He still remembers.

477
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,039
So you see,

478
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,799
it’s not that he doesn’t love you.

479
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,160
He just, for the moment,

480
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,519
doesn’t know how to accept it.

481
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,200
I know too well

482
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,359
how it feels to crave love and not get it.

483
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,440
So I don’t want him hurting like I did.

484
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,240
Please help him.

485
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,559
Then how am I supposed to help?

486
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,599
How is he “lacking love”?

487
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,759
Why doesn’t he feel like a treasure to me?

488
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,279
In the fall of ’99,

489
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,839
I even bought you a pair of socks.

490
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,279
Besides,

491
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,279
you defect just for someone else’s gifts.

492
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:29,559
If you don’t say it,

493
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,440
how would I know you like presents?

494
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,400
It’s not like I can’t buy them.

495
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,880
my big baby.

496
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:45,920
Li Lili,

497
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:47,759
get over here.

498
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:51,960
Mom,

499
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:54,160
I still have to go out
shopping with my mother‑in‑law.

500
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,680
Can we argue another day?

501
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,039
I'm not here to fight with you.

502
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,400
I got you a birthday present.

503
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,039
When things seem off,
something’s fishy.

504
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,039
Did you sprain your back again?

505
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,680
Can you stop cursing me?

506
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,599
So what birthday gift
did you buy me?

507
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,319
My birthday was ages ago.

508
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,359
I was still…

509
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,920
searching for the right gift.

510
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,559
Your mother‑in‑law said
you’re lacking Metal.

511
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,519
How many jin is that metal
in your hand?

512
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,960
Twenty‑six grams.

513
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,200
Eighty thousand grams.

514
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,480
Carry it with you.

515
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
You’ll never lack “jin” again.

516
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,079
Oh, give me a break, Mom.

517
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,440
You want me hauling big dumbbells
every day?

518
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,680
I’m just a young girl.

519
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,799
That’s why I bought pink ones.

520
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,960
I don’t want them.

521
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
You keep them yourself.

522
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,039
I’m going to my mother‑in‑law.

523
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,319
What mother‑in‑law?

524
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,720
You dare ignore me?

525
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,480
You’re not lacking Metal.

526
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,119
You’re lacking a good beating.

527
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,839
Mom’s back.

528
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,640
The daughter‑in‑law’s gone.

529
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,240
No

530
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,720
Mom

531
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:14,920
Who are you with?

532
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,000
Shopping together

533
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,279
Eating street food together

534
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,160
Doing crafts together

535
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,519
Even checking out handsome old men together

536
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,279
How could she do this to me?

537
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,240
Who?

538
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,960
If she can betray me today

539
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,880
She'll betray you tomorrow

540
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,480
Lili!

541
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,279
You followed her?

542
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't have time for that

543
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,160
I just accidentally

544
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,400
Unintentionally... just

545
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,640
Saw it

546
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,640
How did you see it?

547
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,759
It's not

548
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,279
Where I go

549
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,480
They go there too

550
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,759
Isn't that annoying?

551
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,240
Who's following who?

552
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,759
We're back

553
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,400
So you remember to come back

554
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,279
Li Lili!

555
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,799
What about tomorrow?

556
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,559
I plan to visit Zhangjiajie

557
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,640
Come with me

558
00:22:59,119 --> 00:22:59,759
Tomorrow

559
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:02,680
Mom

560
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,720
My mother-in-law rarely visits

561
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,799
Let's go later

562
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,359
I won't say it again

563
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,640
Go ahead

564
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,279
Don't let me affect your mother-daughter bond

565
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,799
No

566
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,359
My mom's being impulsive again

567
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,160
Watch your tone

568
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
No, you're being

569
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,680
Sorry, co-mother-in-law

570
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Lili is willful

571
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,240
Please be understanding

572
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,640
I'll tolerate

573
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:28,839
Okay, okay

574
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,599
Now you're the real mom

575
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,720
I'm the outsider now, right?

576
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,039
That's not what I meant

577
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:34,559
No, no

578
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,440
Not that meaning

579
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,240
No

580
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,960
Mom, I didn't mean that

581
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,880
That's not what I meant

582
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,039
Uh, Meng Meng

583
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,480
On my way back

584
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,160
I met a used DVD seller

585
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,519
Let's watch together tonight

586
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,119
I haven't seen this one

587
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,119
My Beloved

588
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,960
This suits you and mom

589
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,119
Not for me

590
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,200
Meng Meng

591
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
Then I'll endure

592
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,480
And watch with you

593
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,640
Mom, you can't watch this

594
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,920
Too emotionally intense

595
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,640
Like a horror movie for you

596
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,200
Meng Meng won't watch

597
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,640
Then let's watch

598
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,079
Oh, Mou Guiying

599
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,440
Playing this trick on me

600
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,720
Stealing my daughter with sweet talk

601
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,480
Don't tell me

602
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,559
You don't have a son?

603
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:53,880
No, Lili

604
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,599
Eat slowly

605
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,519
What's the rush?

606
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,680
No work today, it's weekend

607
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,720
Mom's waiting for me

608
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,480
Shopping date again today

609
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,920
Meng Meng

610
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,319
You work so hard

611
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,920
It pains me to see

612
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,720
Made you tonic soup

613
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,039
No

614
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:10,960
Mom, this

615
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:12,880
What's with you today?

616
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,079
What's going on?

617
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,000
Let me feed you

618
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,519
No, I couldn't

619
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,519
This isn't proper

620
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,160
Mom must care for you

621
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,680
Here

622
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,599
Like Wu Dalang taking poison

623
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,000
Did my mom poison you?

624
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,920
It’s so hot, why didn’t you say?

625
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Isn’t this clearly emotional blackmail?

626
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,079
How would he dare say anything?

627
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,559
W-what kind of soup is this?

628
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,519
Seafood.

629
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,079
I’m allergic to seafood.

630
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,559
This is still okay.

631
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,559
Hurry, go.

632
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,519
You walked past it.

633
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,319
What are you two doing?

634
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,960
You two can wear parent–child outfits,

635
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,559
but we can’t?

636
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,039
Today, Meng Hang and I

637
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,319
wore these outfits

638
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,880
and walked down the shopping street—

639
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,240
the number of people

640
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,559
turning to look was sky-high.

641
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,480
They all envied our

642
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,000
mother–son bond.

643
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,319
How could they not stare?

644
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,519
But that’s not a parent–child outfit.

645
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:47,839
It’s a couple’s outfit.

646
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,039
Co-mother-in-law,

647
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,880
let’s talk.

648
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,599
Oh, as if I’m scared of you.

649
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:21,519
You’re extra nice to Hanghang

650
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,880
so he’ll resent me more,

651
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:24,920
right?

652
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,720
That’s only because

653
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,880
you used “motherly love” to divide me and my girl.

654
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:33,599
Actually,

655
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
the reason I treat Li Lili so well

656
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
is, first,

657
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,559
Li Lili

658
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,799
is truly lovable.

659
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,279
And another key reason

660
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,720
is Hanghang won’t accept my making amends.

661
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,680
So

662
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,240
I’ve come up with a plan.

663
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
I don’t care about your plan.

664
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,519
With me here,

665
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,279
Meng Hang can feel

666
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,240
what it’s like to be a cherished child.

667
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,440
Give me a chance.

668
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,519
How am I supposed to?

669
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,400
In the past,

670
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,599
I had no choice.

671
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,720
Now I want to be a good mom.

672
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,160
Fine.

673
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,200
Go tell Meng Hang.

674
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,279
See if he even wants you as a good mom.

675
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,359
So you mean

676
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,799
I should give up?

677
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,480
I’m sorry,

678
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,039
I am his mother.

679
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,279
So let’s both

680
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,480
learn how to be good moms.

681
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,599
Don’t you want that?

682
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,599
Mom.

683
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,880
You cooked?

684
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,519
The galaxy must be spinning backward.

685
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,400
Just eat your food.

686
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,599
Quit with the nonsense.

687
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:11,759
Mom.

688
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,400
You didn’t make these wings.

689
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,319
Awful, right?

690
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,440
Your mother cooked them all.

691
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,240
Where is she?

692
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,759
Mom…

693
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,839
Sit down.

694
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,480
I’m going back.

695
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,240
My flight is tonight.

696
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,880
Seeing you and Lili so happy

697
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,160
puts my mind at ease.

698
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,119
I know you hate me.

699
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,559
So

700
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,920
I’ve never dared face you.

701
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,319
These past few days,

702
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,559
with Lili by my side,

703
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,279
I figured something out:

704
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,480
we must pay for our mistakes.

705
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,680
I’ll prove it with my actions

706
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,519
and slowly,

707
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,839
win back your acceptance.

708
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,240
No need to see me off.

709
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Really, don’t.

710
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,759
The car’s right downstairs.

711
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
The car’s right downstairs.

712
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,559
Um…

713
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,400
Hanghang…

714
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,319
This is for you.

715
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,240
Open it after I leave.

716
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,759
No need to see me off.

717
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,640
Really, don’t.

718
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,839
The car’s right downstairs.

719
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,680
Go back, go on, go back.

720
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,160
Mom said when she first left,

721
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,759
she took nothing with her,

722
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,799
except this little bear.

723
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,240
Back then I hugged it every night to sleep.

724
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,160
Later on,

725
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:45,319
Mom held the two of us together.

726
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,000
Mom said

727
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,400
all these years,

728
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,079
she held this little bear every night.

729
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,240
So it got a bit worn out.

730
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,440
These days we ran all over the place

731
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,160
trying to find the same fabric.

732
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,599
But in the end,

733
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,319
it still turned out a bit different.

734
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,319
But Mom sewed all of this by hand.

735
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,720
I even helped with a couple of stitches.

736
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,839
I don’t even like chicken wings.

737
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,119
She just thought I loved them.

738
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,960
I was afraid if I told the truth

739
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,839
it would make her sad.

740
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,240
So that’s what this was about.

741
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,599
You two were glued together lately.

742
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,160
I thought you adored your mother‑in‑law.

743
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
You forced me to go to her

744
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,519
and charge a “mother‑daughter transfer fee.”

745
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,240
Transfer?

746
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,119
You sold me off?

747
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,960
Didn’t you throw this away ages ago?

748
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,079
I picked it back up again.

749
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,320
You want it or not?

750
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,079
I do.

751
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,239
What’s this?

752
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,320
This was my favorite book as a kid.

753
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,239
My dad left it to me.

754
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,039
But my mom

755
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,559
thought the two people in it were crude,

756
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,599
not even wearing clothes.

757
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,000
She tossed it without asking me.

758
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,280
If you want to thank me,

759
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,559
just pay me in cash.

760
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,440
Eight hundred and eighty‑eight yuan.

761
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,599
Not expensive for a childhood memory.

762
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,079
Meng Hang has no idea

763
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,800
my dad may be an alien,

764
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,559
but in spirit he’s a real Earthling.

765
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:51,679
Let’s call him a “spirithling.”

766
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,199
Every time he came back from trips,

767
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,559
he brought me all kinds of Earth comics.

768
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,960
Every single comic book

769
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,280
was a precious childhood memory.

770
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,559
I just don’t get it.

771
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,079
I gave birth to her—

772
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,599
well, not literally, of course.

773
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,840
I raised her—

774
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,039
well, not literally raised her either.

775
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,079
So why is she so nice to someone else?

776
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,079
Let me give you an example.

777
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,880
Say you’re a manufacturer.

778
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,840
You pour in labor and materials

779
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,360
to make this one product.

780
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,280
Then someone walks off with it for free.

781
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,960
How does that make any sense?

782
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,079
Meng Hang,

783
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,159
come pound my back for me.

784
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,639
Other people’s “products” really work better.
