1
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,680
What happened to your foot?

2
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,040
What's going on?

3
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,280
What's this about?

4
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,840
This neighborhood...

5
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,480
The ground's full of potholes.

6
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,159
I twisted my ankle just now.

7
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,400
That broken road in our complex...

8
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,240
Feels like everyone’s twisted an ankle there.

9
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,719
The property management is useless.

10
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,919
I've complained several times.

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,199
No response at all.

12
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,719
I'll get you some medicine.

13
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,879
I can't stand this anymore.

14
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,240
This property management is too much.

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,680
The elevator breaks down every day.

16
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,080
The roads are full of holes.

17
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,719
Four guards, seven teeth between them.

18
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
Hanghang, let me tell you—

19
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,960
This incident is a catalyst.

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,680
I'm rallying everyone to defend our rights.

21
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,879
Ten people have joined me already.

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,400
I'll show this property management

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,159
what rock spirit really means.

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,479
These people go too far, Dad.

25
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,039
Dad.

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,280
You need to be careful.

27
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,520
I heard

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,719
this shady property management

29
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,120
are all streetwise types.

30
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,199
So what if they're streetwise?

31
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,919
Who hasn't been out in the world?

32
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,360
You don't know me.

33
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,039
In words,

34
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,400
I can bring peace with my pen.

35
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:42,919
In action,

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,199
I can settle things on horseback.

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:44,919
Right?

38
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,120
I'll go talk to them.

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,080
If they're civil,

40
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,479
I'll treat them civilly.

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,639
If they get rough with me,

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
I'll show them

43
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,560
what real roughness is.

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,759
Is this the legendary Lightning Five-Chain Whip?

45
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:03,960
Of course—five in a row.

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,479
Co-in-law.

47
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,159
How's my kung fu?

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,039
With your skills?

49
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,879
Even a poodle would be a life-or-death fight.

50
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,680
Then you misunderstand me.

51
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,879
Check my WeChat name.

52
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,759
Rock Mastiff.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
I'll show them what happens

54
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,159
when you anger a mastiff.

55
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,960
Homeowners' Rights Defender.

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,159
Attention, defenders of rights!

57
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,039
In ten minutes,

58
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,680
gather at the east public restroom.

59
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:27,759
Dad.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,159
Be sure to stay safe.

61
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,080
Drink!

62
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,159
Why are you drinking now?

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,800
Liquid courage, you know.

64
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,159
There's meaning behind this.

65
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,639
Red Star lights my way.

66
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,319
Let them see who I am.

67
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,960
Oh my god.

68
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,560
You can speak English too?

69
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,719
I meant the dog seller.

70
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,919
What's wrong with selling dogs?

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Liu Bei sold shoes, didn't he?

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,199
Qin Qiong sold horses.

73
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,319
Elon Musk sells cars.

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,199
Just wait for my victory news.

75
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,039
Be careful.

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,599
It's fine.

77
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,680
Property manager, come out!

78
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,520
Come out!

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,639
Come out now!

80
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,400
Come out!

81
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Hurry up and come out!

82
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,479
Come out!

83
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,000
Manager, come out now!

84
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,120
Come out now!

85
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,080
What's all this noise?

86
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,360
Why are you making such a fuss?

87
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,680
Brother Long.

88
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,879
Those are the troublemakers.

89
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,360
The ringleaders causing trouble.

90
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,439
So you are—

91
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,040
the troublemaking homeowners, right?

92
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,120
I'm the property manager.

93
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,079
Long Yuegang.

94
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,519
Or you can call me

95
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,000
Xiao Long.

96
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,600
First,

97
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,000
we are not troublemakers.

98
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,600
Second,

99
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
since you know we're homeowners,

100
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,439
listen to our complaints properly.

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,720
Serve us well.

102
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,199
Serve us well.

103
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,079
Yes, yes, yes.

104
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,959
Let me be honest with you.

105
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,920
I've managed this property for years.

106
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,439
No one's ever reported problems to us.

107
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,120
Xiao Qiang.

108
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,720
Someone has reported issues.

109
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,000
I-I haven't heard of that.

110
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,519
See?

111
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Not hearing doesn't mean it didn't happen.

112
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,560
Right.

113
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,279
Right, look at these bumpy roads.

114
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,720
The elevator breaks every other day.

115
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,360
Trash piles up and no one cleans it.

116
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,319
We have only three guards in the complex.

117
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,519
They're two hundred fifty years old combined.

118
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,959
Everyone coming and going

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,959
doesn't dare honk the horn.

120
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,959
Afraid the guards will be startled away.

121
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,439
Right.

122
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,120
They'll be gone.

123
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,680
Yes.

124
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,360
The key is,

125
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,439
we're short on funds.

126
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,920
How about this—

127
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,519
let's raise the property management fee

128
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,319
by just one yuan.

129
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,639
I'll immediately hire

130
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,920
guards under sixty.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,279
Trying to make up excuses again?

132
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:25,720
No way.

133
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,439
I'm telling you,

134
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,839
we already pay enough in fees.

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,279
If you don't fix these problems,

136
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,279
starting next year,

137
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,680
we won't pay the property fee.

138
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,519
We won't pay.

139
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,000
Not paying, not paying.

140
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,319
Not paying.

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm afraid that's not possible.

142
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,319
I'll take the lead.

143
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,680
If you don't fix things,

144
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,680
I won't pay the property fee starting today.

145
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,759
Try not paying and see.

146
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,879
I'll try, just watch me.

147
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:46,959
I will.

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,240
I wrote a song complaining about property management.

149
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,319
You're well-educated.

150
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,319
Help me check it over.

151
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,560
If it's too advanced, I can't understand it.

152
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,920
Let me see.

153
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,680
Gotta speak out.

154
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,839
Won't let it go.

155
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,920
Won't stop, won't quit.

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,759
Can't accept, can't ignore.

157
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,800
How is it?

158
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,040
This seemingly simple, repetitive rhetoric—

159
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,879
Isn't it?

160
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,720
Does it fully express
my rebellious spirit?

161
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,879
Is it all out there?

162
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Property manager,

163
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,240
you're pig-headed and big-eared.

164
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,000
You're bloated and greedy.

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,800
You [sensitive words] [sensitive words] [sensitive words].

166
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,560
Dad, why are there so many sensitive words in your song?

167
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,839
It's rock music.

168
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,920
Sometimes you need rough words.

169
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,319
To hype up the mood.

170
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,560
Raise the energy.

171
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,560
Your blood pressure's as high as your height.

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
Try to control your emotions.

173
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,199
At my age, I can barely control my bladder.

174
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,560
Why bother controlling emotions?

175
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,000
Mom.

176
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,120
Are you planning to

177
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,000
just howl this song?

178
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,759
Bass.

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,519
Accompaniment.

180
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,120
I'll do it myself.

181
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,800
You really know how.

182
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,519
Of course I do.

183
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,639
Over thirty years of skill.

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,160
They call me

185
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,120
the Lang Lang of bass.

186
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:02,680
See?

187
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,560
That's technique.

188
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
If the east isn't bright,

189
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,519
the west will shine.

190
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,600
Let the setting sun dry up all sorrow.

191
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,560
Pretty good, pretty good.

192
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,120
Not bad.

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,279
Secondhand Rose.

194
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,959
Liang Long.

195
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,879
Very unique.

196
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,399
I really like it.

197
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,040
How is it?

198
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,199
Every note

199
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,199
hits Liang Long's nerves.

200
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,120
I have other ways to accompany.

201
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,560
You, you—

202
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,839
Are your two dentures fighting in your mouth?

203
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,720
That's called vocal technique.

204
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,480
Is it good?

205
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,759
Is it good?

206
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,600
Hard to say.

207
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,839
After you finish ranting,

208
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,839
no one can eat at this table.

209
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,000
I want to rant so much

210
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,240
that property management can't eat.

211
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,120
Hello.

212
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,519
Let me introduce myself.

213
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,959
I'm the new colleague.

214
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,120
My name is Wang Guizhen.

215
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,399
I'm the boss's assistant.

216
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,680
Hello, hello.

217
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,120
Are you—

218
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,079
Interviewed by the boss?

219
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,519
Interviewed by the boss's wife?

220
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,240
So you're also here

221
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,919
to keep an eye on the boss?

222
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,960
Hello, finally we meet.

223
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,919
But next time,

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,879
don't mention our secret mission.

225
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,039
Okay.

226
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,720
Is this safe?

227
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,120
It's fine.

228
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,759
Come here.

229
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,200
I'm here this time

230
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,039
to help you with the mission.

231
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,080
I'm more professional in this.

232
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,320
There's a professional for this?

233
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,159
Do you know what I used to do?

234
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,600
Paparazzi.

235
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,960
No wonder.

236
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,799
Wait, I do a pretty good job.

237
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,120
Why add another professional to my team?

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Right?

239
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
Boss's wife.

240
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,919
Is she not satisfied with me?

241
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,200
Didn't the boss just secure funding?

242
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,080
His charm has skyrocketed.

243
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,480
Chances of flings have increased.

244
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,799
Boss's wife needs a deeper nail.

245
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,720
Let the neighborhood light up for me.

246
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,639
Go fill in the potholes.

247
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,840
Then get property management fired.

248
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,679
See?

249
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,799
The property company does nothing.

250
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,360
But still raises the price.

251
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,360
He's been yelling all day.

252
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,039
We need to stop him quickly.

253
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,399
Or it'll affect us badly.

254
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,320
True.

255
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,480
Indeed.

256
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,200
It'll hurt our reputation.

257
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,840
I mean it'll affect our health.

258
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,519
I'm coming to find you.

259
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,000
Let's be reasonable.

260
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,960
Be reasonable, be reasonable.

261
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,039
The singing is awful.

262
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,159
It's killing me.

263
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,799
It's like Sun Wukong's headband curse.

264
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,600
Exploded.

265
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,840
Be reasonable, be reasonable.

266
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,240
How do you usually work?

267
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,679
I just watch him.

268
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,799
Then follow him.

269
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
You, you, you're underestimating

270
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,600
a cat's sneaky skills.

271
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
It's fine.

272
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,559
I've trained for this.

273
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,480
I never blink when I'm watching someone.

274
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,840
Internet celebrity.

275
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,960
So many people watching.

276
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,360
Eight bodyguards in one meter.

277
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,519
Fans still find a way in.

278
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
Seems true.

279
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,799
Our industry

280
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,320
is just like any other.

281
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,360
You need to be professional.

282
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,120
Oh my god.

283
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,200
What is all this?

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,919
So many old things.

285
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,759
This—what is this?

286
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,440
A bug.

287
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,799
Isn't this illegal?

288
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,720
Boss's wife personally authorized it.

289
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,919
To use on the boss.

290
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,559
It's fine.

291
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,399
Remember,

292
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,600
in the boss's wife's house,

293
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,159
she makes the rules.

294
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,360
What about this one?

295
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,399
What is this?

296
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,519
High-powered binoculars.

297
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,879
The boss is cheating with Chang'e on the moon.

298
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,759
I could even see it.

299
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,159
No need for that.

300
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:03,960
The boss is afraid of heights.

301
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,759
He can't get up there.

302
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,799
And this one?

303
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,559
Military night vision goggles.

304
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,039
Night vision goggles are a bit much.

305
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,159
We won't need those, right?

306
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,559
Using night vision goggles for this...

307
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,320
Here, perfect timing, take a look.

308
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,240
That's not what I meant.

309
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,639
Look at my pants.

310
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,480
Do they make my legs look short?

311
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,600
They look fine.

312
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,360
Yeah, they're good.

313
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,279
Very classy and stylish.

314
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,960
Details decide success or failure.

315
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
What if the boss goes out at night?

316
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,039
What if our company...

317
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,039
has a power outage?

318
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,360
He goes to the finance lady to check the glowing report.

319
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,000
Boss.

320
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,879
That makes sense too.

321
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,759
The graphic design one.

322
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,440
Every person

323
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,960
has their own

324
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,919
infrared imaging.

325
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,519
The deeper the color,

326
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,159
the higher their temperature.

327
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,519
No idea why,

328
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,200
the boss's color

329
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,279
isn't as deep as the others'.

330
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,840
You need to think more broadly.

331
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,639
Open your mind even wider.

332
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,960
That's normal.

333
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,879
Bosses are usually cold-blooded.

334
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,559
Makes sense.

335
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:04,919
Not good.

336
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,360
I think the boss is going out again.

337
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,759
Then let's hurry and follow him.

338
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,399
No way.

339
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,159
This mission is too dangerous.

340
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,440
You're still young.

341
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,600
Please stay silent.

342
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,879
I'll finish the mission for you.

343
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,159
That won't work.

344
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,000
The boss's wife will say I'm slacking off.

345
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,399
The organization won't doubt your sincerity.

346
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,240
Once I figure out the boss's whereabouts,

347
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,360
I'll send you a secret report.

348
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,720
Keep your communication device on.

349
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,879
I'll just keep an eye on my phone.

350
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,519
Right.

351
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,519
I don't have your number.

352
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,919
We homeowners must be strong.

353
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,559
Be strong.

354
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,879
Let the neighborhood serve me.

355
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:43,879
Serve me.

356
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,039
Stop singing.

357
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,919
Don't touch, don't touch, don't touch.

358
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,879
One string costs three thousand, it's limited edition.

359
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,159
Let's talk calmly.

360
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,399
Talk calmly.

361
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,440
We're using music

362
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,720
to express our demands.

363
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,879
Come on, keep singing.

364
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,440
Stop singing, stop singing.

365
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,799
Everyone, listen to me.

366
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,360
Go ahead.

367
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,679
How about this?

368
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,440
You all

369
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,759
go back first.

370
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,720
I'll consider solving everyone's problems.

371
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,240
How's that?

372
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,080
I'll give you one day.

373
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,960
If I can't solve it,

374
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,879
we'll come back and keep singing.

375
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,679
Stop singing, stop singing.

376
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,399
One day.

377
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,240
One day, one day.

378
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,440
Just one day.

379
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,240
Give them one day.

380
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,320
We'll trust you one more time.

381
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,600
Trust me, trust me.

382
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,879
Finally, they've stopped singing.

383
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,039
Sis.

384
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,279
Li Lili, did I hire you for a vacation?

385
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,279
No, I...

386
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,120
Wang Guizhen

387
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,080
just sent me an eight-thousand-word

388
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,159
tracking analysis report.

389
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,639
And a ninety-nine-page presentation.

390
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,679
What are you doing?

391
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,039
She told me to wait for her message.

392
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,320
Attitude decides everything.

393
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,399
Understand?

394
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm here.

395
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,600
Shut up.

396
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,440
Li Lili, slow down when you eat.

397
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,759
Slow down a bit.

398
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,200
I...

399
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,399
I can't keep up with you.

400
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,919
You guys...

401
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,720
Didn't you see the property manager's face?

402
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,080
It was red one moment,

403
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:26,639
yellow the next,

404
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,360
then green.

405
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,960
He almost kneeled before me.

406
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,639
Now I feel like in our neighborhood,

407
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,600
four words:

408
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,879
a big shot.

409
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,000
Look at you showing off.

410
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,919
Maybe tear up your family tree

411
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,720
and start a new page with you.

412
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,960
Not a bad idea.

413
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,960
Li Lili

414
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,840
Weren't you always talking about dieting?

415
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,039
So how come now...

416
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,320
you just keep eating those wraps?

417
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,879
You guys have no idea.

418
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,759
We got a new coworker at our company.

419
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,399
She's just ruthless.

420
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,759
She almost outcompeted me to death.

421
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,720
How did she do it?

422
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:05,840
She...

423
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,039
followed the boss.

424
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,120
She used a drone directly.

425
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,919
It flew over a thousand meters high.

426
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Covered a five-kilometer radius.

427
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,799
Saw everything in sight.

428
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,840
She could even see the boss's nostrils.

429
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,919
They're upside down.

430
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,440
Better be careful on rainy days.

431
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,200
Water might collect.

432
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,039
That's not what I meant.

433
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,279
She not only...

434
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,080
competes,

435
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,639
she does it secretly.

436
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,039
I figured it out.

437
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,440
There's a technical term for it.

438
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,519
It's called stealth competition.

439
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,279
Right.

440
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,679
Watching the boss

441
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,799
was supposed to be my job, right?

442
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,320
She secretly followed the boss.

443
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,159
Didn't tell me.

444
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,679
The boss's wife thought I was slacking.

445
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,919
She caught me red-handed.

446
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:36,960
No way.

447
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,799
I have to come up with something.

448
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,519
To deal with her.

449
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,919
Come up with something.

450
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,320
I don't really have any ideas.

451
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,640
What are you doing?

452
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,200
Take one more step,

453
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,079
and I'll open the door and let the dog out.

454
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm telling you,

455
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,960
there's a vicious dog inside.

456
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,000
Not responsible if you get bitten.

457
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,799
Well...

458
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,759
It's small,

459
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,079
but it's got a lot of energy.

460
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,240
That tropical fish of yours is expensive, right?

461
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,400
Of course.

462
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,000
If one day...

463
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,799
someday...

464
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,200
there's a power outage or something,

465
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,079
you'd lose a lot, right?

466
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,880
Are you threatening me?

467
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,599
It's fine.

468
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,960
If the power goes out, I'll use coal briquettes.

469
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,240
Why are you hiding?

470
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,039
I'm not hiding.

471
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,079
I'm very gentle.

472
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,920
I remember

473
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,440
you once told us

474
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,720
your pet shop

475
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,119
has trouble with water supply.

476
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,920
You wanted to add another water pipe, right?

477
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,960
Yes.

478
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,240
That's right.

479
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,920
How about this—

480
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,759
as long as you promise us

481
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,200
not to lead any more protests,

482
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,799
and disband that defending rights group,

483
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,759
just dissolve it,

484
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,079
I'll fix your problem right away.

485
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,799
You think you can buy me off with a water pipe?

486
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:46,559
You...

487
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,799
are underestimating me.

488
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,400
Plus a one-hundred yuan

489
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,519
gift card.

490
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,000
Keep dreaming.

491
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,880
Add a kilo of free-range eggs.

492
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,119
Two kilos.

493
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,519
Deal.

494
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,400
Everyone, let's disperse.

495
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,160
No more defending rights.

496
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,839
Why are we leaving?

497
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,480
Why?

498
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,039
Why though?

499
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:20,759
It's you.

500
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,559
You see, the property management has its troubles too.

501
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,839
We all have kids.

502
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,519
Think about it—

503
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,319
if your kid worked for property management,

504
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,880
and people kept making trouble for him every day,

505
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:28,720
how upsetting would that be?

506
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,319
Right?

507
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,000
Besides,

508
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,160
if we keep making a fuss every day,

509
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,839
it disturbs the other residents too.

510
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,519
Right?

511
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,599
You have to think about us.

512
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,400
Aren't we defending everyone's rights?

513
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,559
How is that making trouble?

514
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:38,720
I declare

515
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,400
our defending rights group officially dissolved.

516
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,039
It's over, it's over.

517
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,839
What's going on?

518
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,799
You started this defending rights thing.

519
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,160
Why are you giving up halfway?

520
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,119
Yeah.

521
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,799
I...

522
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm just a dog seller.

523
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,559
What—at a time like this?

524
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,480
You're even speaking English now?

525
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,240
It's not English.

526
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,759
I—I'm just a dog seller.

527
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,680
I can't do this.

528
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,799
I can't do it well either.

529
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,759
No more defending rights.

530
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,319
Let's go.

531
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,599
Go, go, go.

532
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,839
Don't leave!

533
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,920
Old Meng, don't go!

534
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,680
Wait, Old Meng, if you leave—

535
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Old Meng, come back!

536
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,000
Explain it to us, Old Meng!

537
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,319
Old Meng!

538
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
What do we do now?

539
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,079
What's going on?

540
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,000
In Chinese medicine, besides health,

541
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,240
the most important thing

542
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,680
is your mood and emotions.

543
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,160
Running water doesn't rot.

544
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,599
A moving door hinge doesn't get worm-eaten.

545
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,720
Look at me—

546
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,839
I'm already over sixty.

547
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,839
I still want to make use of my energy.

548
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,480
Start a little business.

549
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,119
What kind of business?

550
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,839
Open a morning market.

551
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,000
You probably forgot your own name.

552
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,240
Liu Yingnian!

553
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,559
That's right.

554
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,960
Your name is Liu Yingnian.

555
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,480
Open a morning market.

556
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,680
The market's name is—

557
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,079
Yingnian Morning Market.

558
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,359
You...

559
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,480
You...

560
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:44,440
You...

561
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,720
Could it be him?

562
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,400
My classmate asked me to see a movie today.

563
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,279
I'm heading out first.

564
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,039
I need to rush home for dinner too.

565
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:50,839
Stop.

566
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,640
What's up, ma'am?

567
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,680
Can you

568
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,759
catch up to that car?

569
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:54,640
Get in.

570
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,720
Where do I sit?

571
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,640
Hold that bunch of scallions.

572
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,319
Please sit tight.

573
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,279
This car of mine

574
00:21:59,279 --> 00:21:59,839
is nicknamed

575
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,599
Dougezhuang

576
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,400
Maybach.

577
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,000
Your car is really fast.

578
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,559
I've called a ride.

579
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,519
You don't need to stay with me.

580
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,680
I'm waiting for a ride too.

581
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,799
What movie are you watching tonight?

582
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,039
"Spy Over Trash."

583
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,440
Isn't that movie already off?

584
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Just pick another one.

585
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,960
The boss went east.

586
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,880
West.

587
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,400
Suit.

588
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,759
Looks good.

589
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,279
Not like you can wear it anyway.

590
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,039
My ride's here, bye.

591
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,160
My ride's here too.

592
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,279
Follow the car ahead.

593
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,559
Listen, ma'am,

594
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,079
we're not young anymore.

595
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,640
Why take things so seriously?

596
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,599
Some things

597
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,359
are best ignored sometimes.

598
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,079
Men are all like this.

599
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,079
Besides,

600
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,240
if you really catch him,

601
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,200
you'll actually get divorced.

602
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,599
Are you crazy?

603
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,240
I'm not here to catch a mistress.

604
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,799
Hurry up.

605
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,079
Alright.

606
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:48,799
Hold on tight.

607
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,680
Speeding up now.

608
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:50,519
Go.

609
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,680
Any changes?

610
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,880
Why are you squirming?

611
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,759
Step on it.

612
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,319
Can't step on it.

613
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,160
It's electric.

614
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:10,799
Okay.

615
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,400
Out of power.

616
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,559
What Maybach?

617
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,839
I wouldn't buy it for eighty cents.

618
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:16,640
Seriously.

619
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,839
Ma'am.

620
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,839
My scallions, ma'am.

621
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,279
Please give me the scallions.

622
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,079
Dad

623
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,079
How's the defending rights going?

624
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,240
No, no, no...

625
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,799
No

626
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,039
Can't defend, just messing around

627
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,720
Any results?

628
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:01,599
Results

629
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,359
Results

630
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,000
At the moment, a little

631
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,599
A small result

632
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,319
That's good then

633
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,359
Why do I feel you're not that happy?

634
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
No, not at all

635
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,720
I'm happy

636
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,480
No

637
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,279
Not unhappy

638
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:18,880
Quite happy

639
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,720
What do you think of this part?

640
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,759
I've hated this part since I was little

641
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,079
Song Jiang is so hateful

642
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,680
For his own benefit

643
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,160
He betrayed so many brothers who trusted him

644
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,480
They agreed to

645
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,920
Uphold justice together

646
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,160
But in the end

647
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,079
For a bit of petty gain

648
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,599
He forgot his original intention

649
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,839
So annoying

650
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,519
No, no, no need, no need

651
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,640
Maybe Teacher Song

652
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,279
Maybe he had his own troubles

653
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,440
What trouble could he have?

654
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,400
He's just a petty man who forgets loyalty for profit

655
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,160
People like him

656
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,000
I curse him

657
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,440
May he have no descendants

658
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,359
May his children be born without

659
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,519
a belly button

660
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:57,160
No need for that

661
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,880
No need for that

662
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,880
No need, it's bad for you

663
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,160
Why?

664
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,160
Negative emotions

665
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,359
You vent them everywhere

666
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,720
That's not good either

667
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,400
Not good

668
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,960
Yes

669
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,519
Boiled farm egg

670
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,279
Have one

671
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,359
Hanghang

672
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,039
Me, I just

673
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,359
feel a bit lost

674
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,839
Lost

675
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,279
What are you lost about?

676
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,160
I think your defending rights this time

677
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,319
is especially right

678
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,240
I remember you loved meddling since I was little

679
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,799
Gave me lots of material for my essays

680
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,400
Valuable negative examples

681
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,599
I remember once

682
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,279
The neighbor's

683
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,400
Uncle Zhang

684
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,640
Just went on a business trip

685
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,680
You noticed their home

686
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,920
had a strange man visiting

687
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:39,720
Sneaky

688
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,880
You thought he was a thief

689
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,079
Immediately

690
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,680
called Uncle Zhang

691
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,039
Uncle Zhang came back right away

692
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,839
And the next day

693
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
they got divorced immediately

694
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,119
No

695
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,680
There was another time

696
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,119
You were walking by the road

697
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,079
Saw a manhole cover left open

698
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,119
Kindly

699
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,240
put the cover back on

700
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,559
and put a stone on top

701
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,640
But

702
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,039
two pipe workers were inside

703
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,880
stuck there all night

704
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,160
No signal inside

705
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,000
Couldn't call out

706
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:02,920
The next day

707
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,240
Police checked the cameras

708
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
and found the two men

709
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,519
and found you too

710
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,279
No, no, that's not it

711
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,599
Isn't there anything positive?

712
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,400
There is

713
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,119
Once on the bus

714
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,079
You acted bravely

715
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,799
Smashed a thug with a fire extinguisher

716
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,559
Then they said you were

717
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,000
guilty of excessive self-defense

718
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,319
and fined you several thousand yuan

719
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,160
All my New Year's money

720
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,759
Made me eat instant noodles for half a year

721
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,400
But

722
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,240
I was really proud

723
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,480
Wrote about it in my essays for over a year

724
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,039
Until my teacher ordered me to stop

725
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,119
Dad

726
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,279
Back then

727
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,039
In my heart

728
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,039
you were a hero

729
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
This egg can't be eaten

730
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,440
Why?

731
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
Because

732
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,359
this egg is a

733
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,960
bad egg

734
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,359
What should we do about this?

735
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,920
Our home's power cuts off every day

736
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,119
My spouse and I

737
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,680
really can't take it anymore

738
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,240
The key thing is

739
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,000
my spouse's ventilator

740
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,240
needs electricity every day

741
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,920
Nothing we can do

742
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:16,799
No way out

743
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,319
We can only

744
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,559
move in with my son

745
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:20,359
This elevator keeps breaking

746
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,240
My dad's legs are bad

747
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,480
He really can't climb stairs

748
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,119
No way

749
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,200
I got him a telescope

750
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,039
He can only watch the ladies dance from upstairs

751
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,799
What dance?

752
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,359
The floor tiles are all broken

753
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,680
Eight of us in a row

754
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,640
now only four good legs left

755
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,720
And the security guards

756
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Too few

757
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,119
We had another thief at home yesterday

758
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,079
All my gold jewelry is gone

759
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,799
That was my dowry

760
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:40,319
Really

761
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,799
Really, all of this

762
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,519
could've been solved

763
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,480
That person

764
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,559
shouldn't have left

765
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,039
Exactly

766
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,359
Who said I left?

767
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,279
Old pals,

768
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,680
I was wrong.

769
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,920
Let's start over

770
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,440
and defend our rights to the end.

771
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

772
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,839
To the end.

773
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,000
To the end.

774
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,799
To the end.

775
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,839
Defending rights.

776
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,559
What a coincidence.

777
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,400
We meet again.

778
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,119
Stop pretending.

779
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,400
Let's work together.

780
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,880
Boss, are you picking someone up?

781
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:17,599
It's almost time, he's not home yet.

782
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,039
What are you two good for?

783
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,880
Boss lady.

784
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,039
Um, the boss is right

785
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,200
under my nose now.

786
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,920
This is my action plan.

787
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,920
Please review it.

788
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,079
Very good.

789
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,160
Go with this plan.

790
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,000
Li Lili.

791
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,119
Look at them.

792
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,960
Now look at you.

793
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,519
You really disappoint me.

794
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,359
No, sis,

795
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,799
I'm here too.

796
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:36,400
I...

797
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,799
I really lost them this time.

798
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,160
Bro,

799
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,079
I heard you have someone here

800
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,240
who can hack any system on Earth.

801
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,880
Is that true?

802
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,000
The ceiling of human tech

803
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,759
is just the sole of us aliens' feet.

804
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,160
Awesome.

805
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,480
Quick, hack the Hubble Telescope

806
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,759
and the global surveillance system.

807
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,920
I need to track someone.

808
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:20,960
That's not easy.

809
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,519
I'll get an annual card here.

810
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,920
I'll arrange it right away.

811
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,839
Uncle Meng.

812
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,880
Uncle Meng.

813
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,039
Didn't we agree already?

814
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,599
As your uncle,

815
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,960
I want to live with some rock spirit.

816
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,880
No,

817
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,680
You still took my stuff.

818
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,839
Trying to use these

819
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,680
sweet bribes to break me?

820
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,759
Then you really

821
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,000
underestimate your uncle.

822
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:56,839
Gift card.

823
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,039
Here, take it back.

824
00:31:59,119 --> 00:31:59,640
Eggs.

825
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:00,640
Take them back.

826
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,279
There are a few.

827
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,559
I boiled them for you.

828
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,319
No need to thank me.

829
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,440
You're something else.

830
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,440
Aren't you afraid your pet shop

831
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,799
might lose water and power someday?

832
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:11,880
If it comes to that,

833
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,880
I'll just close the pet shop.

834
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,279
If that doesn't work,

835
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,039
then...

836
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,279
I'll move out.

837
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,079
But

838
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,559
their problems

839
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,599
you must solve.

840
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:24,599
After I leave,

841
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,319
they'll fix things for everyone—

842
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,400
repair the elevator,

843
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,000
pave the roads,

844
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,039
add more security.

845
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:29,799
Remember,

846
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,759
it's not because they've changed,

847
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,960
but because

848
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,400
we were here.

849
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,640
Old Meng, you're the coolest.

850
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,319
So cool.

851
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,160
Old Meng, awesome.

852
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,319
You're the best.

853
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,599
We both lost the person.

854
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,920
Boss lady won't fire both of us.

855
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:55,799
No punishment for the crowd.

856
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,039
Sorry,

857
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,000
you lost the person.

858
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,119
I didn't lose them.

859
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,359
What do you mean?

860
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,880
How did you pull it off?

861
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,039
High-level connections.

862
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,000
Boss lady.

863
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,519
You...

864
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:24,960
are fired.

865
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,920
Boss lady.

866
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,200
Give me another chance.

867
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,759
I don't want to see this traitor.

868
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,240
I'm innocent.

869
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,960
Though I failed the mission,

870
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm loyal to the boss lady.

871
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,160
Oh, give me a break.

872
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,839
You're the mole sent by the boss.

873
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,799
I'm not.

874
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:39,920
We analyzed

875
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,359
your ninety-nine-page presentation.

876
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,680
Every clue in it misled us.

877
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,960
You did it to cover for the boss.

878
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,359
I didn't.

879
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,799
Still won't admit it?

880
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,079
Come on.

881
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,720
You personally put the boss on the plane.

882
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,440
Mole.

883
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Take the mole away.

884
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,240
I...

885
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,200
Got myself caught in the mess.

886
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,720
Bro...

887
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,680
I—I forgot my bag.

888
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,159
Bro...

889
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,159
Well done.

890
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,519
It's my duty.

891
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,000
You brought this tea, right?

892
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,320
Smells great.

893
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,559
Let me try it.

894
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,280
Sister Cai.

895
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,239
Sister Cai.

896
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Pour me a cup.

897
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,639
Pour some tea.

898
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,519
Still leaving?

899
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,679
You're already in checkmate.

900
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,519
It's useless.

901
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,199
Why are you yelling?

902
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,079
What's going on?

903
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,639
With my guidance as your mentor,

904
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,880
everyone in the neighborhood came out.

905
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,360
We voted and chose a new property manager.

906
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,320
They're really reliable.

907
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,840
This is the banner everyone gave me.

908
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:02,119
NEIGHBORHOOD GUARDIAN

909
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,679
Nice job, Dad.

910
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,239
This is meaningful. We should display it.

911
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,119
Really?

912
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,159
Dad, isn't it already displayed?

913
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,159
I'll post this on my Moments later.

914
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,360
Kids, remember to

915
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,599
share, like, and comment.

916
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,320
Okay.

917
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,840
Well done, well done.

918
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,880
I also won a great battle today.

919
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,039
I should post on my Moments too.

920
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:25,880
What's up?

921
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,039
Let me tell you,

922
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,079
I found out our boss

923
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:30,599
has someone far away in France—

924
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,239
a romantic interest.

925
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,320
Good thing I found out early.

926
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,159
They're still in the platonic stage.

927
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,119
If I'd found out later,

928
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,639
it would've turned into a real affair.

929
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,320
Impressive.

930
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,000
Of course.

931
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,920
And I also discovered

932
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,960
the new stealth competition fanatic at our company

933
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,960
is actually a mole planted by the boss.

934
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,239
I exposed them.

935
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
The boss's wife rewarded me with twenty thousand yuan.

936
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,639
I've noticed,

937
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,840
your work skills lately have

938
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,280
improved by leaps and bounds.

939
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,239
Mainly, no one pushed me before.

940
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,480
Once this colleague showed up,

941
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,679
my potential got dragged out.

942
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,960
But our boss is something else.

943
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,920
He's over forty,

944
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,880
still doing things across two continents,

945
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,840
meeting women online.

946
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,000
Such immature stuff.

947
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,800
Men are boys until they die.

948
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,119
So you mean

949
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,239
you're a boy until you die too?

950
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,840
That's right.

951
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,920
So my feelings for you

952
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,719
will always be like

953
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,559
a first love.

954
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,280
So your first love is—

955
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,679
It's this late already.

956
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,199
Time to eat.

957
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,000
Where's your mom?

958
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,880
Where did your mom go?

959
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:39,800
Mom.

960
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,000
Mom.

961
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:44,760
Mom.

962
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,119
Don't come back.

963
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

964
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,800
It's all my fault.

965
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,679
You almost died at my feet.

966
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,119
But you didn't, right?

967
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,960
Can you stop scolding me?

968
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,960
If you scold me again,

969
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,880
If you scold me again,

970
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,199
I'll tear down your house, believe it or not.

971
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,280
Forget it.

972
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,119
Just go.

973
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,760
From now on, we owe each other nothing.

974
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,360
Heaven rewards those who work hard.

975
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,960
PURE COMMUNITY

976
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,480
CARING FOR THE PEOPLE

977
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,760
NEIGHBORHOOD LIGHT

978
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,320
Humans,

979
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,239
have a problem with blind worship.

980
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,960
Take this guy, for example.

981
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,239
Yesterday, everyone pointed fingers at him.

982
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,280
But today,

983
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,519
he's suddenly changed,

984
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,159
becoming a hero in their eyes.

985
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,920
What did he even do?

986
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,639
He just went to the property office

987
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,880
and shouted a few times.

988
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,119
What's so hard about that?

989
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,199
Alright.

990
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,599
I need to

991
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,639
change this bad habit of humans

992
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,920
and set him straight.
