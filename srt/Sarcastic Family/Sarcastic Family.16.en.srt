1
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,079
I really don’t want to leave you.

2
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,359
First thing in the morning,

3
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,159
you’re already so sweet.

4
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,560
Because in this world,

5
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,599
only you never criticize me,

6
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,719
never blame me,

7
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,080
you just accept me unconditionally.

8
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
I’ll be there at nine.

9
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,919
Just a brief meeting.

10
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,680
Don’t block my way.

11
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,199
No.

12
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,520
How come you’re all clingy in bed

13
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,120
and a brat as soon as you get off?

14
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,719
That’s separation anxiety.

15
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,919
So you still can’t let me go.

16
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,560
Who can’t let you go?

17
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,560
I meant the bed.

18
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,560
I can’t leave it either.

19
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,479
Every single character

20
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,159
needs a clear, sharp persona.

21
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,199
This time,

22
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,319
I’m a Cantonese drifter in Beijing,

23
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,639
trying to make it in this strange

24
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,479
big city and find my footing,

25
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,400
put down some roots.

26
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,520
That’s quite a spread.

27
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,520
Hands off my favorite chicken feet.

28
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,840
Wait for my message.

29
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
No problem.

30
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,879
You just need to pretend

31
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,199
you’re really keen on the place.

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,520
Do not overact, whatever you do.

33
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,000
I’m already in character.

34
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,000
Come on, come on, come on!

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,960
In character, my ass.

36
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,199
You’re just a shill.

37
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,159
And you’ll shill me away, huh?

38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,280
I’d never.

39
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,400
I won’t ditch you.

40
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,039
I’ll

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,919
gnaw it clean.

42
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,439
Just wait.

43
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,840
It’ll come looking for you

44
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,840
to claim your life.

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,360
Taste.

46
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,159
Taste it, just taste it.

47
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,240
Screw you, damn it.

48
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,719
There’s a trick to this.

49
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,080
Of course there is.

50
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,719
August twenty‑sixth.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480
Got it, your birthday.

52
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,959
Last quarter’s numbers were okay,

53
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
so no bottom‑ranking layoffs.

54
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,920
However,

55
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,240
this morning I checked

56
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,319
our current headcount.

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,120
It’s an odd number.

58
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,759
My horoscope teacher said

59
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,319
even numbers bless me this month.

60
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,519
So one person still has to go.

61
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,439
You understand?

62
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,480
Who it’ll be,

63
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I’ll weigh everything up

64
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,920
and tell you tomorrow.

65
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,680
All right.

66
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,639
Meeting adjourned.

67
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,560
Li Lili, stay behind.

68
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,279
How’s the boss doing out of town?

69
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,519
Busy going to nightclubs every day.

70
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,879
Nightclubs?

71
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,240
I mean, it’s…

72
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,480
industry review and networking events.

73
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,079
Don’t worry.

74
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,920
I’ve packed his schedule

75
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,240
completely full.

76
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,839
And at his hotel,

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,319
I’ve squared things with the manager.

78
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,319
Oh, right, sis—

79
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,240
these places

80
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,040
all work with my Sky Eye plan,

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,639
the partner hotels and restaurants.

82
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,920
If the boss crosses any red line there,

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,879
I’ll get an alert at once.

84
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,079
Okay.

85
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,279
Email me a copy later.

86
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:07,879
Sure thing.

87
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,560
I’ll get going then, sis.

88
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,279
Go on.

89
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,319
Here,

90
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:21,959
have some tea.

91
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,360
This is our best tea in the shop.

92
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,279
Over 1,000 yuan a liang.

93
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,319
So, what do you think?

94
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,040
I need to think a bit more.

95
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,680
Now is the best time to buy.

96
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,399
Here we go.

97
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,439
Lately,

98
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,240
my rhinitis has been acting up.

99
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,399
Hello, brother-in-law.

100
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,079
Brother-in-law.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,480
Uh...

102
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,120
My English name is Jeff.

103
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,240
This apartment...

104
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,680
I must have it.

105
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,439
No...

106
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,319
Mr. Li, please have a seat.

107
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,720
I have another client here.

108
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,959
Please wait a little longer.

109
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,360
I can't wait at all.

110
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:38,879
Brother...

111
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,279
This apartment...

112
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,519
Let me have it.

113
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,399
Not long ago...

114
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,000
My brother-in-law in Hong Kong, China...

115
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,680
passed away.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,720
Brother-in-law...

117
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,279
Rest in peace.

118
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,480
Your brother-in-law might be watching you right now.

119
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,240
Let me tell you...

120
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,759
My brother-in-law had no children.

121
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,759
He left me a large inheritance.

122
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,439
I consulted a feng shui master...

123
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,879
from Victoria Peak.

124
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,040
This apartment...

125
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,360
is very peaceful.

126
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,639
This peaceful apartment...

127
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,519
I must have it.

128
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,560
Bro...

129
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,600
This morgue...

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:16,920
No...

131
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,199
This peaceful apartment...

132
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,279
Give me the contract.

133
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,120
Xiao Meng...

134
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,759
Look at this jerk you found.

135
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,680
You think I'm a fool?

136
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,480
No...

137
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,799
No...

138
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,320
Brother Liang...

139
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,279
Bro...

140
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,080
I was wrong.

141
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,279
You were indeed wrong.

142
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,279
You completely failed...

143
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,480
to match my emotions.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
In one minute...

145
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,919
I switched through four emotions.

146
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
Happiness, anger, sorrow, joy—all there.

147
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,240
And you?

148
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,519
I forgive you.

149
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,720
Next time I'll match you.

150
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,600
I'll try a more natural acting style.

151
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,879
No, no, no...

152
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,799
My stage here is too small.

153
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,879
Can't handle you.

154
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,600
Wait...

155
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,399
There's a children's room.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,720
Perfect!

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,080
Character development...

158
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
needs an anchor.

159
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,960
I say...

160
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,360
I don't need it.

161
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I've decided.

162
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,200
My next persona will be...

163
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,159
a single dad.

164
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,600
I'll prepare right away.

165
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,879
I'll use this new persona...

166
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,000
to win over your clients.

167
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,399
I'm going to be a dad.

168
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,000
Last month, three clients left me.

169
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,799
They're not really going to fire me, right?

170
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,120
Of course not.

171
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
The boss lady said...

172
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,039
it's not decided yet.

173
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,720
Besides, you usually...

174
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,279
It's me.

175
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,159
Right?

176
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,480
Right.

177
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,519
Then you have to help me.

178
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,120
Put in a good word with Wu Mansha.

179
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,440
Why would she...

180
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,759
listen to me?

181
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,000
Everyone knows...

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,879
you're her confidant.

183
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,440
She even holds private meetings with you.

184
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,960
No...

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,120
Just help me out.

186
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,720
I really can't lose this job.

187
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,600
No...

188
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
To her...

189
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,440
my words carry no...

190
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,639
Please.

191
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,799
Not this...

192
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,840
Baby, we're home now.

193
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,399
Starting today,

194
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,679
I’m your dad from now on.

195
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,600
I’ve thought of a

196
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,840
super cute name for you.

197
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,600
You’ll be called Jenny.

198
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,519
Do you like it?

199
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,279
You like it a lot.

200
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,039
Here,

201
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,679
let me pat your head.

202
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,279
Li Cai.

203
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,320
Come here.

204
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,240
Coming.

205
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,919
Don’t be scared.

206
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,480
Slow down.

207
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,200
Let’s go.

208
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,120
Aunt Cai.

209
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,840
What’s all this about?

210
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,159
You’re even kneeling to beg me.

211
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,000
Get up, come on.

212
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,039
What if I can’t fix it?

213
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,960
Then you knelt for nothing.

214
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,399
What the heck is this?

215
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,519
This is my son.

216
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,039
Jenny.

217
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,440
An alien.

218
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,759
A damn turtle.

219
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,879
Father and son,

220
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,039
different paths, same turtle.

221
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,320
Are you out of your mind?

222
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,279
About this…

223
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,399
I’ll watch it next time.

224
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,240
I’m off.

225
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,360
Get back here.

226
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,600
Help me pull my arm out.

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
I knew something was off.

228
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,600
You practicing walking through walls?

229
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,960
Then don’t stop halfway.

230
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,960
Go all the way through.

231
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,000
Quick, Jenny, watch wall‑passing.

232
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:36,720
Never seen that, right?

233
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,799
I don’t want to pass through.

234
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,519
Help me, just

235
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,000
pull my arm back out.

236
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
Fine, I’ll pull it out.

237
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,679
But first, can you tell me

238
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,480
why you’re in Uncle Meng’s room?

239
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,559
Are you writing

240
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,360
or drawing,

241
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,080
what are you doing?

242
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,720
You colored it all black.

243
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,320
Your black eight never goes in.

244
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,440
Looked so pitiful.

245
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,960
So I made everything black.

246
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,279
Seriously…

247
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,519
you’re way too idle.

248
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,879
Don’t you always say our band

249
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,559
is a money‑losing joke?

250
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,120
Here, take a look.

251
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,759
We made money, we did!

252
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,320
You finally sold all the instruments?

253
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,360
What are you talking about?

254
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,639
Senior College talent show

255
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,799
prize money.

256
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,279
How much?

257
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,320
Five hundred.

258
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,799
To sign up for this event,

259
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,960
how much was the fee?

260
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,440
One thousand.

261
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,879
Quit that snarky tone.

262
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,159
You’re just flat‑out jealous.

263
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,639
We’ve got nothing in common.

264
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,360
Honestly…

265
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,759
That one thousand we spent,

266
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,000
that was money.

267
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
This five hundred we got back

268
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,360
is honor.

269
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,360
Honor.

270
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
You definitely don’t get it.

271
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,159
As long as you’re happy.

272
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,000
Still guarding against me.

273
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,639
You’re so damn stingy.

274
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,480
You’re still too green.

275
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,279
It’s stuck.

276
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,600
It’s stuck.

277
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,000
So you like Uncle Meng?

278
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,559
Wait till I pull my arm out.

279
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,799
Then I'm totally beating you up.

280
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,080
Then I’m definitely not helping.

281
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,519
I won’t hit you.

282
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,440
Okay, I won’t, I won’t.

283
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,120
Come on, come on.

284
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,759
Don’t hit me, okay?

285
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,559
Come on, come on.

286
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Come.

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
One, two, three.

288
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,279
Go.

289
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,799
My arm’s gonna snap off.

290
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,320
No.

291
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
Just use your superpower.

292
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,279
I haven’t used it in ages.

293
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:11,840
Jam.

294
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,639
It’s bugged out.

295
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,039
Otherwise…

296
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,840
go find a big hammer.

297
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,639
Let’s smash the wall down.

298
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,639
That’s a load‑bearing wall.

299
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,080
If it falls, we’re both darn it.

300
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,360
Then what do we do?

301
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,799
We wait till your power comes back.

302
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,679
That’ll take over ten hours.

303
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,399
What am I supposed to do now?

304
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,159
Today,

305
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,200
I’ll take care of you.

306
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,759
That way,

307
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,320
my persona gets more nuanced.

308
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,240
I’m not just a single dad.

309
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,320
At the same time,

310
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,639
I’ve also got an elderly

311
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,519
mother who can’t care for herself.

312
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,559
Come, Jenny.

313
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,759
Call her Grandma.

314
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,519
You little punk.

315
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,759
I’m back.

316
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,360
Old Meng’s back.

317
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,000
Quick, quick!

318
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,720
Stop him, hurry!

319
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,639
Don’t let him see me.

320
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,159
Okay.

321
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,120
Go, go, go, hurry.

322
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,960
Hurry up, go.

323
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,240
Uncle Meng’s back.

324
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,200
When did you get back?

325
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,600
What are you flustering about?

326
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,039
I…

327
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Look at your guitar.

328
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:05,919
I was just—

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,639
What about my guitar?

330
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,519
This guitar’s great.

331
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,320
You can feel it.

332
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,799
What are you doing here?

333
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,240
You’re just—

334
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,159
With such a nice guitar,

335
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:19,840
I figured

336
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,960
I’d help tidy your place.

337
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,759
Wait.

338
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,440
Uncle Meng,

339
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,279
um, you know…

340
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,120
let me explain.

341
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,759
This is the one from my shop,

342
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,039
the Ninja Turtle.

343
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:34,840
Ninja Turtle?

344
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,000
What’s that supposed to mean?

345
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,879
I thought I’d explain it to you.

346
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,960
I just borrowed it to help me

347
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,039
get into character.

348
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,960
Jenny

349
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:41,960
is my baby now.

350
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,840
“Jenny Turtle,”

351
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,559
a magic pet.

352
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,799
Why’s it hanging there?

353
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,279
What?

354
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,519
Hanging what?

355
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,799
Why hang it there?

356
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,519
I…

357
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,519
was cleaning up.

358
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,279
I just put it there.

359
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,080
Um…

360
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,039
don’t distract my cleaning.

361
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,120
I’ll do it myself, I’d rather.

362
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,879
That’s my foot rag.

363
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:58,799
I’ve used it seven years.

364
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,200
Don’t hang it by my bed.

365
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,359
Just chop my hand off.

366
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,920
No, you’d better replace it fast.

367
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,559
You, you—

368
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:06,960
Okay, okay.

369
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,240
I’m working, I’m working, working.

370
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,480
Weird.

371
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,880
Xiaoli.

372
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,720
Take this back with you.

373
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I can’t accept it.

374
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,920
I get it now.

375
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,559
I just felt I was wrong too.

376
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,119
Yeah.

377
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,160
We’re coworkers, this is not right.

378
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,680
I don’t even know what flavor you like.

379
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,079
You pick one yourself.

380
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,599
No.

381
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,519
I really can’t take any.

382
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,119
Got it.

383
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,759
Take the whole box.

384
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,000
Xiaoli, that’s not what I meant.

385
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:39,640
Don’t worry.

386
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,160
I’ll help you if I can.

387
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,079
No need to bring me gifts.

388
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,119
Understood.

389
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,359
You really get it, okay?

390
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,720
Hurry, take it back.

391
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,400
Sure enough, she liked none of it.

392
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,119
I’ll do it.

393
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,960
I can.

394
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,759
I can handle it.

395
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:35,400
Didn’t I say

396
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I’d take care of you today?

397
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,680
Okay, okay.

398
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,839
Here, eat.

399
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,440
All right.

400
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:44,920
Sleep.

401
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,440
Eat.

402
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,720
Sleep.

403
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,839
Eat.

404
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:51,880
Sleep.

405
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,319
Eat.

406
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,440
Sleep.

407
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,279
How are you not done eating?

408
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:03,920
I can’t reach it.

409
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,559
Sorry.

410
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,559
Here.

411
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,440
Let me feed you first.

412
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,079
How’s that hand of mine?

413
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:10,880
Don’t worry.

414
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,960
Nothing can go wrong.

415
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,720
As long as you hold tight.

416
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,039
Baby, let’s start brushing.

417
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,839
Where are your teeth?

418
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,200
Then let’s just take a bath.

419
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,519
Let’s play some baby songs.

420
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,200
You’d better keep that little turtle

421
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,119
inside your head when you wash.

422
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,920
How strong is the water flow?

423
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Why is there a kid crying?

424
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,599
Has your little rascal turned into a demon?

425
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,200
I set three alarms for the night

426
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,079
to realistically simulate a baby crying.

427
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Darn it

428
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,400
Your alarm is really annoying.

429
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,440
You’re back.

430
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,079
Dad.

431
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,079
What’s going on?

432
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,839
Lili, you’re finally back.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,559
Don’t even mention it.

434
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,640
My colleague is such a handful.

435
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,480
Work relationships are really hard.

436
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,960
I get it.

437
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,160
Totally get it.

438
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,440
Come on, come on.

439
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,200
Everyone, go back to your rooms.

440
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,119
Go, go, go.

441
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
What happened here?

442
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,480
Mom, why are you sleeping here?

443
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,480
I… well…

444
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,519
I learned a little health trick.

445
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,880
Got it.

446
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,440
Saw it on some junk clickbait, right?

447
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,359
Sounds dodgy already.

448
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,559
Hurry and go sleep in your bed.

449
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,119
Stop.

450
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,200
I…

451
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,720
I’m sleeping right here.

452
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,240
It gets my energy flowing.

453
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,799
Feels especially good.

454
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,279
I see.

455
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
You don’t like this bed.

456
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:49,519
How about this:

457
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,759
Tonight you share Lili’s room.

458
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
That bed is softer.

459
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
No, no, no need.

460
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,200
I sleep better right here.

461
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,400
I’m grounding myself here.

462
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,480
I understand.

463
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,200
I’ll lay a pallet on the floor.

464
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,480
So you can really “ground” yourself.

465
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,680
Do you not understand human speech?

466
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,559
I’m not going anywhere tonight.

467
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,079
I’m sleeping right here.

468
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:06,640
It’s no use.

469
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,400
I’ve figured it out.

470
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,799
Some people just can’t get you.

471
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
I’ve told her over and over,

472
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,440
spelled it out many times,

473
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
and she still doesn’t get it.

474
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,839
Maybe you should say it differently.

475
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,720
Say what?

476
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,599
Go chill wherever you can.

477
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,400
You don’t get to boss me around.

478
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,079
Got it.

479
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,960
That works.

480
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
So that works too, huh.

481
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,519
This light Li Cai installed for me,

482
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,640
how do I turn it off?

483
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,000
You have to remove the bulb.

484
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,519
That’s way too much trouble.

485
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,519
This is an insulator.

486
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,759
What’s the principle here?

487
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,839
Just you wait.

488
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
It will come for you,

489
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,319
to claim your life.

490
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:31,799
Lili.

491
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,640
I see you.

492
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,720
I’m really not surprised at all.

493
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,000
You told me not to bring you gifts.

494
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,000
I thought you were hinting

495
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,279
I could bring them to your home.

496
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:43,880
Right?

497
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,000
Wrong.

498
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,200
I was being very direct.

499
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,640
Watch my lips.

500
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,599
I

501
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
do not need

502
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:52,920
any gifts.

503
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,599
You just

504
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,039
go chill wherever you can, okay?

505
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,759
Work relationships are so hard.

506
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,000
Come in.

507
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,519
Have a seat.

508
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,599
I’m sorry, Lili.

509
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,799
Honestly, I don’t get it either.

510
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,680
The workplace…

511
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,839
I learned all this from clickbait posts.

512
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,039
What?

513
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,759
You must give gifts to get things done.

514
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:33,079
There is no boss who refuses gifts,

515
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,920
only staff who don’t know how to give.

516
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,319
It’s just…

517
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,039
What are you doing here?

518
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,559
You two know each other?

519
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,240
Yeah.

520
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,279
Just now,

521
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,559
I was downstairs sunning the baby,

522
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,720
and we chatted for quite a while.

523
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,599
We shared lots of parenting tips.

524
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,799
Right.

525
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,319
Men taking care of kids

526
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,680
are already rare.

527
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,920
If my daughter’s dad

528
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,079
could be like him,

529
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,359
we wouldn’t have split up.

530
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,559
Split up?

531
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:58,799
Yeah.

532
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,240
I’m a single mom now.

533
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,400
I have to work,

534
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,680
and look after the kid.

535
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,279
Life’s already really hectic.

536
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,920
But for the sake of living,

537
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,240
I can only slog on, no matter what.

538
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,799
Meaning,

539
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,279
whether I’m

540
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,480
tired to death or crushed by work,

541
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,519
I still can’t quit.

542
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,240
Don’t worry.

543
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,119
My sister will help you.

544
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,440
And I can help watch the baby too.

545
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,000
You’re such a good dad.

546
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,920
But keeping a kid cooped up

547
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,039
like this really isn’t good.

548
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,480
Jenny.

549
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,799
You must want to go back to your bed.

550
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,519
Right?

551
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,319
Seems you’re really

552
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,480
a little homebody in a big rush.

553
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,880
My younger brother

554
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,920
is the one raising him.

555
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:36,680
The turtle.

556
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,240
You sit, don’t mind me.

557
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,759
Why am I being dragged in?

558
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,079
I can’t end up jobless either.

559
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,480
My skills are kind of coming back.

560
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,160
One more.

561
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,519
One.

562
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,240
Two.

563
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,279
I just had a dream.

564
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,680
Where’s my red envelope?

565
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,680
Let go.

566
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,960
Of my hand.

567
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,599
How did it go through?

568
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,359
When is the client coming?

569
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,240
I’m ready.

570
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,680
I’m done.

571
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,720
The contract’s signed.

572
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,559
The client booked me in advance.

573
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,880
It went extremely smoothly.

574
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,440
Didn’t need you this time.

575
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,000
You secretly booked them behind my back?

576
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:58,920
Didn’t you?

577
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,319
Keep your voice down.

578
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,359
I slave away at home with the baby—

579
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,680
for what?

580
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,400
Isn’t it all to help you succeed?

581
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,400
But you?

582
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,160
You used me and the baby.

583
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,440
No.

584
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,599
It’s not what you two think.

585
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,079
No.

586
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,440
Brother‑in‑law,

587
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,119
you’ve let me down.

588
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,839
I hate you!

589
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,079
I’m your brother‑in‑law,

590
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,519
not your uncle‑in‑law.

591
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:23,880
This…

592
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,759
No…

593
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,599
It’s not…

594
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,839
It really isn’t what you think.

595
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,960
Th‑this, this…

596
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:42,799
Sis,

597
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
this is for you.

598
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,599
So thoughtful.

599
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,039
Um…

600
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,880
Has the layoff list come out?

601
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Why are you so nervous?

602
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,559
It’s not you anyway.

603
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:56,839
Okay.

604
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,599
I’ll get back to work then, Sis.

605
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,480
Go on.

606
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,880
No way, sis.

607
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,240
You can't fire Xiaoli either.

608
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,160
She usually works really hard.

609
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,279
She caught that last mistake in time.

610
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,440
How do you know I plan to fire Xiaoli?

611
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,640
I...

612
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,200
accidentally

613
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,880
saw the list.

614
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,400
I'm on it too.

615
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,119
I haven't made any mistakes.

616
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,039
You haven't, true,

617
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,079
but the boss is doing well now.

618
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,359
That Sky Eye system you set up,

619
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,440
once I fully took it over,

620
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,559
I don't really need you anymore.

621
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,400
Redundant asset,

622
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,160
can be discarded.

623
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,160
No, wait,

624
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,519
doing a good job

625
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,200
can be a reason to get fired?

626
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,920
That's ridiculous.

627
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,680
Still,

628
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,680
I checked,

629
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,400
you two earn so little.

630
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,000
Fire you or not, it hardly matters.

631
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,839
Forget it.

632
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,680
You...

633
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,160
My mood’s been a roller coaster.

634
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,200
Thanks, sis.

635
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,799
I'll hurry and tell Xiaoli.

636
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,599
She just got divorced.

637
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,839
She can't lose her job too.

638
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,519
Wait.

639
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,000
Come here.

640
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,480
So she's a single mom now?

641
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,640
Yeah.

642
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,440
Sis, maybe give her a raise?

643
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,279
And while you're at it,

644
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,160
give me one too.

645
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,440
Tell Xiaoli right away

646
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,039
to go resign at HR.

647
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,640
What do you mean?

648
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,119
In her situation,

649
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,559
the time she can give to work

650
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,680
will definitely decrease.

651
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,559
Bad asset

652
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,440
must be cut.

653
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,359
Go.

654
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:37,880
Li Cai.

655
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,279
Got a minute?

656
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Got a case?

657
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,160
First time

658
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,079
the firing reason is feng shui.

659
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,880
Right.

660
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,880
The boss’s wife says evens are lucky.

661
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,799
Now it's an odd number.

662
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,799
So one must go.

663
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,400
The second reason to fire her

664
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,880
is she has to look after her kid,

665
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,000
might affect her work.

666
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,680
She’s a single mom.

667
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,519
Yeah.

668
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,279
Isn't odd supposed to be unlucky?

669
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,240
That's what the boss’s wife said.

670
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,400
Li Lili.

671
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,720
Wait for me a bit.

672
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,400
Sis.

673
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,319
What is she here for?

674
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,519
To ask about decorating.

675
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,160
She didn't ask about decoration.

676
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,559
Yeah.

677
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,720
She’s really gossipy.

678
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,480
She kept chatting with me

679
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,680
about Liu Xiaoli getting fired.

680
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,759
Are you stupid?

681
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,759
Hi, sis.

682
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,000
Hello.

683
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,640
You are...?

684
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,279
I’m here to ask about decorating.

685
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,880
Then let me explain it to you.

686
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,240
No need.

687
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,279
This young lady

688
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,680
explained everything clearly.

689
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,240
She did?

690
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,559
Sis, don’t worry.

691
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:52,880
I did a great job explaining.

692
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,119
She’s very satisfied.

693
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,680
You this free?

694
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,200
No,

695
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,880
I’m quite busy.

696
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,880
Then go get busy, sis.

697
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,079
I’ll stay here.

698
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Be smart.

699
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:09,839
Okay.

700
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,079
Relax.

701
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,079
Do you have any other cases like that

702
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,599
around here

703
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,839
We do

704
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,799
For example

705
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,920
For example

706
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Like firing people

707
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,200
Aren’t you Li Guess

708
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,720
What are you doing here

709
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,839
I’m waiting for Director Cai

710
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,640
I started a pastry shop business

711
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,519
I fired a pregnant single mom

712
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,359
and she sued me

713
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,480
She’s in charge of the probe

714
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,519
If it’s confirmed as true

715
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,519
I’ll get a heavy penalty

716
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,279
So my guess was right

717
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,440
She’s from Labor Inspection

718
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,119
Can you put in a word for me

719
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,599
I can only speak up for myself

720
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:49,720
Li Lili

721
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,160
Li Lili

722
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,480
Message Liu Xiaoli right away

723
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:53,960
Tell her

724
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,880
I’ll raise her annual pay by 30%

725
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,240
And no overtime on weekends

726
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,839
For women with special situations

727
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,000
we must give full care and support

728
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,359
Okay

729
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,160
Sure

730
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,400
I’ll get going

731
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,599
Take care, sis

732
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,360
Take care

733
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,199
Director Cai, I…

734
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:10,920
It’s me, Xiao Li

735
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
We’ve fixed everything at the shop

736
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,119
Hired lots of chefs this time

737
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,360
Could you please not fine us

738
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
Starting up wasn’t easy for me

739
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,400
I’ll go right now

740
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,760
Immediately

741
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:26,880
All right

742
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,320
I’ll go this way

743
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,679
Hurry up

744
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,039
Hurry up

745
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,199
Dad

746
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,119
Dad

747
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,400
Dad

748
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,719
It’s not that much trouble

749
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,840
Who

750
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,719
hit me

751
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,480
I just

752
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,079
had a dream

753
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:21,519
Yeah

754
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,440
You hit yourself just now too

755
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:30,559
I left a red envelope here

756
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,639
You’re dreaming

757
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,000
You didn’t rest well

758
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:48,880
Sleep a bit more

759
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,559
Nice vase

760
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,480
Just bought it

761
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,559
Look

762
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,599
Xiaoli and her daughter painted it

763
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,199
I really like this present

764
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,840
Though I don’t have many scenes

765
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,159
I’m still the director

766
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,360
Without my direction

767
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,559
Aunt Cai couldn’t play her role

768
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:43,760
And in the end

769
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,480
I didn’t get any gift at all

770
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,760
They didn’t even paint me

771
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
It’s fine

772
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,880
Just be an unsung hero

773
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:57,880
Unsung

774
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,800
Nice character setting

775
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,719
Next

776
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,679
I’ll play a low‑key

777
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,239
hero who bears every hardship

778
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,559
You two

779
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,519
got any references for me

780
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,760
Earthlings are way too complicated.

781
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,480
Back on my home planet, when I worked,

782
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,039
I just needed to finish my tasks.

783
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,400
I never had to worry about

784
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,679
what my boss was thinking,

785
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,280
or what he thought I thought of him,

786
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,639
or what he thought I thought of him,

787
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,880
or what he thought of me.

788
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
What are you even talking about?

789
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:35,880
Compared with Earthlings,

790
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,039
my people are simple like idiots.

791
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,280
Take me, for example.

792
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,239
My boss at the editorial office,

793
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,559
besides assigning me work,

794
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,920
just chats with me, nothing else.

795
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,199
He talks to me whenever he’s free,

796
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,079
asking things like,

797
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,760
“What’s human hallucinogen alcohol

798
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,960
actually taste like?

799
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,639
What’s that magical tipsy feeling?”

800
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,760
And he kindly tells me, too,

801
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,960
that in human society,

802
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,920
subordinates often gift booze to bosses.

803
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,920
Isn’t that great?

804
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,920
There’s zero mental friction between us.

805
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:00,559
Wait, no.

806
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,599
Have you never considered

807
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,320
that your boss is hinting at you?

808
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,599
Talking about alcohol like that, he’s

809
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,719
obviously implying something.

810
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Of course I picked up on that.

811
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,320
Today he even told me

812
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,800
the interstellar delivery procedure,

813
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,920
plus his home address.

814
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,559
Could it be any more obvious?

815
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,760
I just got back from the bar.

816
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,519
There you go, that’s it.

817
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,599
Why would I mail him alcohol?

818
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,360
What’s the point of sending booze?

819
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,159
I packed Da Liu in an astro-crate

820
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,119
and shipped him over to my boss.

821
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,039
Didn’t he want to learn about booze?

822
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,079
Da Liu’s a total booze guru.

823
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,400
He’ll explain everything in one go.

824
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,679
So, how’s that?

825
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,639
How many layers deep was that play?

826
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,079
You’re in the basement.
