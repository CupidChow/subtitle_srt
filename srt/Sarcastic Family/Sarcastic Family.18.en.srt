1
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,280
I don't feel like eating.

2
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,799
Eat the breakfast I bought.

3
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Heavier than eating my wedding feast.

4
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,599
You’re so harsh you curse yourself.

5
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,639
Mom,

6
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,840
please don’t get me wrong.

7
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,319
The breakfast you bought

8
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,840
is absolutely delicious.

9
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,639
It’s on par with

10
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,439
Michelin.

11
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,439
I’m just worried about my sales.

12
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,159
Your sales

13
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,879
have stably stayed at the bottom.

14
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,000
Haven’t you got used to it?

15
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,080
Bottom and zero are not the same.

16
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,840
Housing prices keep dropping lately.

17
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,319
No one’s buying houses at all.

18
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,560
This year

19
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,840
I’ve already gone two months

20
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,199
without a single sale.

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,879
You actually had sales before that?

22
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,520
Mom,

23
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,960
how can you say that?

24
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,759
Meng Hang is already suffering so much.

25
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,439
As his future mother‑in‑law,

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,879
emotionally and logically,

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,960
shouldn’t you comfort him a bit?

28
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,240
Of course, of course, of course.

29
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,199
Of course.

30
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,240
These housing prices,

31
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,439
for your sales,

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,919
the impact is only temporary.

33
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,400
Right.

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,199
Right.

35
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,280
But your ability

36
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,479
hurts your sales forever.

37
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,439
Why are you adding fuel to the fire?

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,520
Agents need to be thick‑skinned.

39
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,400
Can’t handle even this blow,

40
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,800
then change careers.

41
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,800
Just ignore her.

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,639
She doesn’t know anything.

43
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,400
She knows everything.

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,120
Let me tell you something.

45
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,400
When a baby eagle is born,

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,080
it can’t fly.

47
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,800
The eagle pushes it

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,080
off the cliff.

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,919
While it is falling,

50
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,280
it learns how to fly.

51
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:42,879
That

52
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,319
is the

53
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,639
power of courage.

54
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:45,719
Now

55
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,199
go stand by the boss’s door,

56
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,360
I’ll give you a push too,

57
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,719
just like the eagle

58
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,800
pushing its chick off a cliff.

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,240
Do you get what I mean?

60
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,759
Got it.

61
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:55,919
Good luck.

62
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,319
Yeah, that’s it.

63
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:29,720
Hey,

64
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,720
what are you doing?

65
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,879
No knock? You scared me!

66
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,800
So rude, what’s wrong with you?

67
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,240
Manager, I knocked, you didn’t hear.

68
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,399
Manager,

69
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,160
look at our phone app.

70
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,439
Here’s a listing.

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,800
Under this listing,

72
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,160
there’s a

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,879
“Contact agent” button.

74
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,040
Once you tap it,

75
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,959
Old Cha is always the first.

76
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,519
You scroll forever,

77
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,240
and then

78
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,920
get to the bottom,

79
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
then finally reach me.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,879
No wonder my

81
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,519
sales are so bad.

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,639
Seriously?

83
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,319
Let me see.

84
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,360
My wife used our app days ago

85
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,920
to look for houses.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
When she clicked in,

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,439
on “contact agent,”

88
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,680
the first one to reply

89
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,920
was definitely Old Cha.

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,800
She even boosted his metrics a lot.

91
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,399
Do you think it could be

92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,319
big data

93
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,800
guessing what she likes?

94
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,480
You?

95
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,519
You think you deserve that?

96
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,319
Lily,

97
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,480
likes

98
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,680
a guy like

99
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,399
you, a total scumbag?

100
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,439
Have you no

101
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,319
shame at all?

102
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:45,920
You—

103
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,199
What’s this,

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,279
you getting mad now?

105
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,879
What are you doing up there?

106
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,360
No,

107
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,199
this, this…

108
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:00,959
this…

109
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,959
No, this…

110
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,759
Boss, why is there a fly in here?

111
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,079
You’re the one buzzing like a fly.

112
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,959
Get down from there.

113
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,279
What a day, such a show.

114
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,240
Manager.

115
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,399
About this list,

116
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,240
it’s sorted by pinyin initials.

117
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,519
Mine starts with C,

118
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,279
so it’s before any M, right?

119
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,720
C.

120
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,240
C-H-A,

121
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,240
that’s a C.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,759
Z-H-A

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:28,920
is a Z.

124
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,800
Exactly.

125
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,560
C-H-A,

126
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,560
“Cha,” like my name.

127
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,480
“Cha,”

128
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,399
“Cha.”

129
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:40,720
Fine.

130
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,720
Say you are a C.

131
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,600
Then Old Bai in our company

132
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
should be a B.

133
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,000
Why is he still behind you?

134
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,240
You must have

135
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,240
connections with the dev director

136
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,560
and got yourself moved up.

137
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,399
That’s small-minded.

138
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,639
You’re being petty.

139
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
Your worldview’s too small.

140
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,519
That’s straight-up slander.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,639
Old Bai

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,439
is an old Manchu.

143
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,959
His original surname is

144
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,079
Guwalgiya.

145
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,120
His G should come earlier,

146
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,800
so

147
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,079
he’s listed right after me.

148
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,839
Then my English name is “Abandon” too.

149
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,839
No one asked your English name.

150
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,319
We’re talking about

151
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,040
All right, all right, enough.

152
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,759
Stop arguing.

153
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,560
Set up like this,

154
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,319
it does have issues.

155
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:21,959
Here’s what we’ll do.

156
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,839
I’ll talk to our colleagues

157
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,800
in the dev department.

158
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,920
Have them adjust it.

159
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:27,920
I’ll make sure

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
every employee in the company

161
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,160
appears on the front page equally.

162
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,040
Happy now?

163
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,720
Thanks, manager.

164
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,079
Old Cha—

165
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,399
C-H-A,

166
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,040
Cha—

167
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,560
you’re really such a “cha,” huh.

168
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,319
You’re back.

169
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:56,600
How did it go?

170
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,199
Did you tell the manager?

171
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,879
Yeah, I did.

172
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
That’s the way.

173
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,800
You must fight for it.

174
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
Alexander the Great,

175
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,040
after he conquered Greece,

176
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,920
someone asked him,

177
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,079
“If you had the chance,

178
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,680
would you attack Persia?”

179
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,519
Guess what he said.

180
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,360
He said, “You spoke Chinese,

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,399
I don’t understand.”

182
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,519
He said,

183
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,480
“I never wait for chances.

184
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I always create them myself.”

185
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,399
Then he went and took Persia.

186
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,680
See how inspiring that is?

187
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Why the long face then?

188
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,120
Did the manager fix it for you?

189
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,879
Sort of.

190
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,879
Don’t “sort of” me.

191
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,279
You must be precise in life.

192
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,320
You know,

193
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,840
there was a Soviet astronaut

194
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,759
who misread one decimal place.

195
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,559
The whole rocket exploded.

196
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,759
Why do you keep rambling?

197
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,360
I’m not rambling.

198
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,960
I’m just… just—

199
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,039
The manager said

200
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,320
everyone will get equal time

201
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,879
on the platform’s front page.

202
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,840
But guess what.

203
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,519
All the prime locations

204
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,320
belong to others.

205
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,320
On my profile, all I list

206
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,120
are old, shabby shoeboxes.

207
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,039
I think

208
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,279
this whole thing

209
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,200
is because I complained

210
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,799
and pissed off the tech team.

211
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,960
They’re screwing me on purpose.

212
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,159
Don’t always assume the worst.

213
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
Old dumps have perks too.

214
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,679
They’re cheap.

215
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,799
Small profit, big sales.

216
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,399
Right?

217
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,600
Once there was an old man,

218
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,559
his name was Sai Weng.

219
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,360
One day,

220
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,279
his horse ran off.

221
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,080
His mom ran off.

222
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
Horse.

223
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,000
What is up with you lately?

224
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,320
You keep telling kiddie stories.

225
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,399
Are you babysitting your boss’s kid

226
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,519
and got side effects from it?

227
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
No.

228
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,679
In my recent research on Earth,

229
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,080
I made a big discovery.

230
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,120
Humans have this thing

231
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,960
called “success studies.”

232
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,879
I never knew success was a science.

233
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,639
It teaches people how to succeed.

234
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,399
And this…

235
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,440
is called “chicken soup” talk.

236
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,000
Success gurus all read this.

237
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,200
You should study it hard.

238
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
Tell me, is this ceiling

239
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,440
leaking?

240
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,159
It leaks when it rains.

241
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,879
It’s the top floor.

242
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,080
What top floor doesn’t leak?

243
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,799
The drains in this place

244
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,720
stink.

245
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,000
Old blocks all smell like that.

246
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,600
Smell it.

247
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,799
Then let’s see the bedroom.

248
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,600
No need.

249
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,679
No windows.

250
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,279
Floor’s cracked too.

251
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,559
This place has been

252
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,639
listed with you for years.

253
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,360
You never thought to fix it up?

254
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,799
Who would fix this dump?

255
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,519
But it has one merit.

256
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,840
It’s cheap.

257
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,679
Cheap means poor quality.

258
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
You’re brutally honest, huh?

259
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,240
Honesty’s all I’ve got left.

260
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,679
It even fell off.

261
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,519
No wonder there’s a painting.

262
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,679
It’s to cover the crack.

263
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,039
Just admit it’s cracked,

264
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,559
why cover it up?

265
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,200
So fake.

266
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,799
I hate people like that most.

267
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,000
This painting here...

268
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,960
I hung it up back in the day.

269
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,559
Th-this...

270
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,440
You...

271
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
Back then,

272
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,440
I'd just graduated college.

273
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,399
This was the first place I rented.

274
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Now that I have money,

275
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,279
I wanted to buy it.

276
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,559
As a keepsake, you know.

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,600
It's rare,

278
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,440
this place is still the same.

279
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,440
Oh, right.

280
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,840
Isn't there a saying?

281
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,919
No matter how far you go,

282
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,000
you must never forget

283
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,200
where you started from.

284
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,200
That sounds familiar.

285
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,759
"Small Stories, Great Wisdom."

286
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,279
Page two hundred fifty, right?

287
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,799
You like self-help too?

288
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,360
Yeah, yeah.

289
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,200
We really click, huh.

290
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

291
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,480
I read all of them.

292
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,240
Reader, Bosom Friend, Yilin—

293
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,919
I love them all.

294
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,320
Yes, yes, those few books.

295
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,240
Wait, so you...

296
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,360
You bought this place just as a keepsake?

297
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,200
It's just a bit of money.

298
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,200
You know, young man,

299
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,080
you're pretty interesting.

300
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,440
It's my first time seeing

301
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,919
an agent who doesn’t want to sell.

302
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,600
It’s not that I don’t want to.

303
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,480
With a wise client like you,

304
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,600
I’d rather be honest.

305
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,519
But still...

306
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,240
You’re back.

307
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,200
What went wrong this time?

308
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,960
It’s nothing.

309
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:29,919
Listen to me.

310
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,120
What’s most precious in life

311
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,879
is the resolve to get things done.

312
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,720
Let me tell you a story.

313
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,559
They say Sima Guang couldn’t get up.

314
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,720
So later,

315
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,120
he drank a big vat of water

316
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,039
so that

317
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,799
his full bladder woke him early.

318
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,279
It forced him out of bed.

319
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,320
And then?

320
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,120
He wet the bed.

321
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,879
So you knew that one.

322
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,519
Then I’ll tell a different story.

323
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,240
All right, enough.

324
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,679
Thanks, really.

325
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,000
Why so down?

326
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,960
Didn’t sell any?

327
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,480
That’s not it.

328
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,159
I did sell.

329
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,320
How many?

330
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,159
Two units.

331
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,399
No.

332
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,000
Twenty units.

333
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,080
No.

334
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,440
Two hundred units.

335
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,600
Where would I find that many?

336
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,440
Eighteen units.

337
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,919
Then you’re more of a fool—

338
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,879
than this guy is.

339
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,960
It means

340
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,279
happy.

341
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,799
I feel like opening your skull.

342
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,159
You’re amazing.

343
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,120
But this guy

344
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,559
bought 18 apartments at once.

345
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,799
He must be loaded.

346
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
He wasn’t buying for himself.

347
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,519
His company

348
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,159
does asset allocation.

349
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,279
Do you know asset allocation?

350
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,279
No.

351
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,000
It means managing rich people’s money.

352
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,159
For example,

353
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
you have twenty million.

354
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,320
How to spend it to make it grow?

355
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,759
I top up my hot pot membership card.

356
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,200
Pay 200, get 50 extra.

357
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,519
Then I’ve got twenty‑five million.

358
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,480
All you know is eating.

359
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,159
As for this boss,

360
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,679
first,

361
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,759
he’s buying himself property.

362
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,200
second,

363
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,200
he’s testing reliable agents.

364
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,960
And I passed his test.

365
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,279
So these

366
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,960
18 units all count as your sales?

367
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,480
Of course they count as mine.

368
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,399
This intention contract

369
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,480
has been signed by the manager.

370
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,879
You’re incredible.

371
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,919
Meng Hang, I knew you’d make it.

372
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,679
Edison

373
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,000
failed over 20,000 times at the bulb.

374
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,399
Madame Curie, to extract radium,

375
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,600
failed over 30,000 times.

376
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,639
Our national team kept failing at the World Cup…

377
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,679
Forget the national team.

378
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,480
Don’t bring them up.

379
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,080
Okay.

380
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,240
There’s one more thing.

381
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,279
Well,

382
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,399
the company

383
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,000
wants me, at the quarterly review,

384
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,559
to give a presentation,

385
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,840
sharing how I succeeded.

386
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,399
I don’t know what to say.

387
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,200
Should I just turn it down?

388
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,440
Why turn it down?

389
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,480
Isn’t this a good thing?

390
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,320
No, you don’t get it.

391
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,960
The meeting’s at headquarters.

392
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,120
That means

393
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,000
speaking before thousands of people.

394
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,320
That’s terrifying.

395
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,480
All the more reason to go.

396
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,120
It’s clearly a sign of promoting you.

397
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,359
Your talent

398
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,000
must be shown at HQ,

399
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
on a big stage like that,

400
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,279
to really shine.

401
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,559
Because the environment

402
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,960
decides how high you rise.

403
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,880
You know?

404
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,880
There’s a kind of fly

405
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,839
that travels thousands of miles

406
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,079
from North America to scenic Australia.

407
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,119
Once they get there,

408
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,039
they just eat nectar and fruit.

409
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,279
Later their offspring

410
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,880
gradually evolve into bees.

411
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,240
That inspirational story of yours

412
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,200
really defies basic biology.

413
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,640
Forget biology.

414
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,160
We’re talking success theory now.

415
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,359
If you want to succeed,

416
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,960
you must seize this chance.

417
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,359
I…

418
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,839
can really do it?

419
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,160
You definitely can.

420
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,839
Come on.

421
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,319
Meng Hang,

422
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,119
sit, sit, sit.

423
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:42,759
I…

424
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,400
No, it’s just—

425
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,000
Sit.

426
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,880
You really don’t know.

427
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,279
Right from the start,

428
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,160
I’ve rated your work ability highly.

429
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:50,880
No,

430
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,599
I mean,

431
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,920
boss, don’t say that.

432
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,640
Every single week,

433
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,119
sit down.

434
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,599
at the weekly meeting,

435
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,200
the one you single out

436
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,039
has always been me.

437
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:00,880
Who says so?

438
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,559
I’ll pull up the records.

439
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,119
Got it.

440
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,000
Second week of March last year.

441
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,039
You weren’t the one I criticized.

442
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,039
It was Old Zha.

443
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,599
Besides,

444
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,000
was I really criticizing you?

445
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,880
I was pushing you forward.

446
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,440
Look at all the people in the firm.

447
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,799
Why don’t I criticize anyone else,

448
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,599
only you?

449
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,440
It’s because I have

450
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,319
high hopes for you.

451
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,960
You know that saying, right?

452
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,279
“When heaven gives someone a great task,

453
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,799
it first drives them insane”—

454
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,519
no, that’s not it.

455
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,200
First it has to… you know—

456
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,880
you get what I mean.

457
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,359
Right?

458
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,359
Right.

459
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,839
So,

460
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,000
you’ve actually been

461
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
testing me all along.

462
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,799
Of course.

463
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,119
Think about it:

464
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,839
your numbers have always been last,

465
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,039
yet I’ve still kept you on.

466
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:54,960
I never fired you.

467
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,160
That’s obviously because

468
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,240
I’m a thousand-li horse

469
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,880
who spotted you, my talent scout—

470
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,000
no, wait—

471
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,359
I mean I’m the talent scout—

472
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,519
I’m the… whatever.

473
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,400
Anyway,

474
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,079
when you give your talk at HQ,

475
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,160
you can work some of this in.

476
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
Say how much I’ve influenced you.

477
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,640
This isn’t mandatory,

478
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,359
just

479
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,920
a little suggestion from me.

480
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,559
All right.

481
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,000
Got it.

482
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,480
Got it.

483
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,720
Yeah, got it.

484
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,079
How does it feel?

485
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:00,839
Brother Meng.

486
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,400
I hung it up there myself.

487
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,960
I wanted to put a famous quote on it.

488
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,079
In some artsy font.

489
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,359
But the system couldn’t read it.

490
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
I’ll change the quote later.

491
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,200
This was arranged by the manager.

492
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,119
This was arranged by all of us.

493
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,799
Sales champion this year,

494
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,680
it has to be you.

495
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,359
You’re the model of our whole station.

496
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,839
But this…

497
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,119
Just doing one photo

498
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,519
is really a bit plain.

499
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,319
Later on,

500
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,160
I’ll custom‑make you a

501
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,880
life‑size standee.

502
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,319
We’ll put it right here.

503
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,079
No, no, no.

504
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,279
That’s too much, really.

505
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,079
Brother Meng,

506
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,160
when you’re a leader later,

507
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,319
don’t forget your little bro.

508
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,000
Me, a leader? Come on.

509
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,960
That’s not happening.

510
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,079
You’re going to speak at HQ.

511
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,920
Even our chief never got that.

512
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
If you’re not a leader, who is?

513
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,599
Brother Meng,

514
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,359
do you know why I used to

515
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,400
always push the hardest jobs to you?

516
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:50,920
You were dumping work on me.

517
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,000
True.

518
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,119
I am indeed a “handsome guy.”

519
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:56,759
Not funny, huh?

520
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,319
No.

521
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,079
Smile.

522
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,279
Smile.

523
00:20:59,480 --> 00:20:59,920
Smile.

524
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,039
All this time,

525
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,440
we’ve been grooming you as a leader.

526
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,319
So

527
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
all the tricky problems

528
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,640
were given for you to solve.

529
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,279
Wait, what?

530
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,200
Since when did you guys

531
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,079
start grooming me as a leader?

532
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,680
We always have been.

533
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,119
And it’s like an elevator—

534
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,359
a straight vertical promotion.

535
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,160
Our whole station

536
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,400
knows you’re the next chief.

537
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,920
You’re the only one who doesn’t.

538
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,200
Know why?

539
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,079
Your biggest flaw

540
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,400
is you lack confidence.

541
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:28,920
You haven’t realized

542
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,640
how good you are inside.

543
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,160
How am I “good” at all?

544
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,839
You’re good in every way.

545
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,319
Spell it out then.

546
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:38,880
Here’s the thing.

547
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,119
If people praise you,

548
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,079
it means they see your value.

549
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,640
If they criticize you,

550
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,559
they’re jealous of your value.

551
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:47,720
Old Zha,

552
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,400
that life‑size standee—

553
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,680
we must change the photo.

554
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,039
Okay.

555
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,000
This one’s way too ugly.

556
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,480
My bad.

557
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,200
I was just jealous of you.

558
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,640
So I made it ugly on purpose.

559
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,559
I’ll definitely fix it.

560
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,000
Here's how things stand now.

561
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,519
As long as Meng Hang nails this report,

562
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,799
he'll definitely get promoted.

563
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,240
But right now,

564
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,720
he just has no confidence.

565
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,759
He keeps thinking

566
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,680
he’s only come this far

567
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
because of pure luck.

568
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,640
So we

569
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,680
have really got to help him

570
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,559
build up his confidence.

571
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,759
With his abilities?

572
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,599
What good is confidence even then?

573
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,119
How can you say that?

574
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,759
His skills are actually quite good.

575
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,359
And how is that useless?

576
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,960
Have you ever heard

577
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,119
the story of the charm?

578
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,160
No.

579
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,000
Let me tell you then.

580
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,920
Once there was a mother

581
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,880
whose son was going off to war.

582
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,720
She gave him a little pouch

583
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,519
and told him,

584
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,480
"Inside here

585
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,720
is a protective charm.

586
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,640
It will make you

587
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,880
immune to swords and bullets.

588
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,440
But you must never open it."

589
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,119
So the son

590
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,839
went to war wearing the charm.

591
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,279
Sure enough,

592
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,880
he won every battle.

593
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,200
Until one day

594
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,279
curiosity made him open it, and he saw

595
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,880
it was empty—

596
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,880
nothing inside at all.

597
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,599
And just like that,

598
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,640
his confidence collapsed.

599
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,559
Next day in battle again,

600
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,799
he was cut down by the enemy.

601
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,160
So tell me,

602
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,799
what does this story mean?

603
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,680
It means if you don’t listen to Mom,

604
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,599
you’ll get hacked to death.

605
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:09,880
Your comprehension is terrible.

606
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,559
Next.

607
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,319
It, uh, means…

608
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
it means the mom was too stingy.

609
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,920
A protective charm,

610
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,440
and she makes a fake one?

611
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,359
That’s totally messing with him.

612
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,200
That’s definitely not it.

613
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,039
You’re no better.

614
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,440
This story shows

615
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:22,640
people must have confidence.

616
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,720
These next few days,

617
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,079
we’ve got to treat Meng Hang well,

618
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,680
so he can seize this chance.

619
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,039
Don’t we usually treat him

620
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,279
pretty well already?

621
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:29,839
Yeah, we do.

622
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,400
You do?

623
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,480
Seriously?

624
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,400
Sorry.

625
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,880
That’s for wiping your butt.

626
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You can’t wipe the piano with it.

627
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,119
Use this to wipe it.

628
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,480
Honestly…

629
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,160
Your shoulder, your shoulder.

630
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,680
Mom, especially you—

631
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,240
these days you really have to

632
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,119
say nice things about him.

633
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,319
I don’t know how to praise people.

634
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,519
Not scolding him is my limit.

635
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,839
Think about it:

636
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,160
once you praise him,

637
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,279
he gains confidence.

638
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,480
With confidence,

639
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,440
he gets promoted.

640
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,480
Once he’s promoted,

641
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,279
he’s happy.

642
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:29,839
When he’s happy,

643
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,519
he’ll take the whole family traveling.

644
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,680
To Antarctica.

645
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,960
How does that sound?

646
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,400
All right.

647
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,240
I’ll do my best.

648
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,039
See?

649
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,000
I finally found what we share.

650
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,119
I like cold places too.

651
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,599
How about this:

652
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,440
we go to Mohe, okay?

653
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,640
You go to Mohe.

654
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,960
I’ll go to Antarctica.

655
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,640
Who’s traveling with you?

656
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,119
Going to Mohe costs so little.

657
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,119
Antarctica costs a fortune.

658
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,519
Then… wouldn’t I be losing out?

659
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:53,880
Then…

660
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,279
Then you can go to the black zone.

661
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,440
You can’t return without 2–3 million.

662
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,240
Then you won’t lose out.

663
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,279
Then why don’t you go?

664
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,839
I’m not going to Mohe.

665
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,279
All right.

666
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:00,680
Enough.

667
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,440
When the time comes, you two

668
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,319
can go wherever you like.

669
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,920
Our top priority right now

670
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
is to help Meng Hang build confidence.

671
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,119
I’m back.

672
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,279
The big leader’s back!

673
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,200
Say what?

674
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,359
Why did you kick me?

675
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,640
The big leader’s back.

676
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,200
Aren’t you giving up your seat?

677
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,920
Yes.

678
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,680
Right.

679
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,720
Sit.

680
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,000
Sit, sit, hurry and sit.

681
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,039
Sit, Dad, sit.

682
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:24,559
Sit, sit, sit.

683
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,559
What’s that supposed to mean?

684
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,720
We were just talking about you.

685
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,680
Go on.

686
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,519
Without you in this home,

687
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,960
look, it doesn’t even run.

688
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:31,880
No, that’s not it.

689
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
You, seriously…

690
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,680
are you praising me or insulting me?

691
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,160
Why do I feel there’s subtext there?

692
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,559
W-what were you saying about me?

693
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:38,599
Well…

694
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,519
Say it.

695
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,720
I heard you got promoted this time

696
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,160
purely on your own ability.

697
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,000
That’s right.

698
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,400
Not a bit of luck involved.

699
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,359
Probably, yeah.

700
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,720
Look at the store manager—

701
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,319
he saw this coming long ago.

702
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,200
When he heard you got promoted,

703
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,519
he was happier than at dad’s misdiagnosis.

704
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:58,519
Well…

705
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,720
I kind of think so too.

706
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,799
See? He’s pretty confident.

707
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,880
Keep buttering him up, keep going.

708
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:05,839
Today,

709
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,519
the manager told my coworkers

710
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,079
that from the very beginning

711
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
he’d been grooming me

712
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,559
according to this

713
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,039
future leader track

714
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:13,960
all along.

715
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,559
Didn’t expect you to notice that.

716
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,839
The whole world can see it.

717
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,359
Really?

718
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,039
You’re not just a leader at work;

719
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,640
you’re the head of this family too.

720
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:24,920
Some people

721
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,880
just can’t ever seem

722
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,279
to find their own place.

723
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,799
You should criticize her when needed.

724
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,640
Right? You…

725
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:30,839
Right, Leader?

726
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,359
Honestly, I think you

727
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,400
should now focus on

728
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,000
our

729
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
spiritual development.

730
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,440
For example,

731
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,799
organize

732
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,799
a trip to Antarctica or something.

733
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,920
Isn’t that a bit rushed?

734
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,480
Depends on my son’s mood.

735
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,039
Your son got promoted,

736
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,039
what are you strutting around for?

737
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,039
Showing off on his coattails.

738
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,559
Isn’t he a sly old fox?

739
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,240
You two, you two—

740
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,559
sit down, sit down.

741
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,279
I don’t want to sit with him.

742
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,119
Come on, come on.

743
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,440
Um…

744
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,559
Mom, lean on me, sit next to me.

745
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,240
Let me say a few words.

746
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,440
Before this,

747
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,960
my self‑awareness

748
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,960
and place

749
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,079
was off.

750
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,599
So,

751
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,119
I didn’t step up to lead the family.

752
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,279
That’s on me.

753
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,680
From today on,

754
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:16,880
I will definitely

755
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,519
run this family

756
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,799
properly and

757
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,839
take charge.

758
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,359
Mom,

759
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,000
let me say something to you.

760
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,000
Stop stirring up fights in the family.

761
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:30,960
That’s not good.

762
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,880
A peaceful home brings everything.

763
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:34,880
Exactly.

764
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,079
Watch Ni Ping’s shows more

765
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:37,680
often when you’re free.

766
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,680
They’re great.

767
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,039
Dad,

768
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,680
same goes for you.

769
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,319
Don’t just

770
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,279
talk and do nothing.

771
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,720
Get moving.

772
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,279
For example,

773
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,440
that bowl in the kitchen,

774
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,559
wash it later, okay?

775
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,240
Go on.

776
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,680
Lili,

777
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,359
you’ve been reading well lately.

778
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,519
You’ve read a lot of books.

779
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,519
That’s worth praise.

780
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,400
About that speech I asked for,

781
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,200
get it done, yeah?

782
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,119
Okay, everyone, let’s move.

783
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,279
Get moving.

784
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,559
Nice, that’s the spirit.

785
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,559
He’s adjusting pretty fast.

786
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,039
Yeah.

787
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,759
Faster than I expected.

788
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,880
Comrade Li Lili,

789
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,839
what is this speech about?

790
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,640
It’s like a story magazine.

791
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,839
These are all handpicked stories.

792
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:33,960
Look,

793
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,960
first you went to the boss

794
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,440
and I used the eagle story to cheer you up.

795
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,359
Then

796
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,559
“a blessing in disguise,”

797
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,279
everything is the best arrangement.

798
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,200
And in the end

799
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,359
you never give up,

800
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,720
like that old lady long ago

801
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,400
with a big iron rod

802
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:46,880
grinding away every day, ka—

803
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,920
Okay, okay, enough.

804
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,359
These stories are ancient clichés.

805
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,640
Are you overdosing on chicken soup?

806
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,279
How is that “overdosing on chicken soup”?

807
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,000
If I hadn’t used success theory

808
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,200
to teach you to fight the boss,

809
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,000
would you be this successful now?

810
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,279
What’s that got to do with you?

811
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,079
Didn’t I tell you?

812
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,119
The manager’s been grooming me as a leader.

813
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,039
My coworkers,

814
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,519
your mom, my dad included,

815
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,240
all see how outstanding I am.

816
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,079
What’s that got to do with your stories?

817
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,880
They’re too cheesy.

818
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,000
I used to think you lacked confidence.

819
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:24,559
But now I feel

820
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,759
you’re a bit too full of yourself.

821
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:28,480
Criticizing me,

822
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,240
right?

823
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,759
People who criticize me

824
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,240
are either insecure

825
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,440
or

826
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,759
jealous

827
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,039
of how great I am.

828
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,480
Me,

829
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,599
jealous of you?

830
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,200
Fine.

831
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,519
Then I’m out.

832
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,559
You figure it out yourself.

833
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,240
Write it yourself then.

834
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,160
This…

835
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,839
It’s already full, this…

836
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,119
Respected

837
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,160
leaders,

838
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,440
dear friends,

839
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,559
and all who fight on

840
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,039
the front line of property sales—

841
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:22,960
What are you reading?

842
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,400
You.

843
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,920
A speech.

844
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I’m about to head

845
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,119
to HQ to report in.

846
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,319
No need to go.

847
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,880
Just stay here and work.

848
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,640
Why?

849
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,559
Why?

850
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,480
That deal died. Why else?

851
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,200
Eighteen deals,

852
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,240
all gone.

853
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,279
Nineteen.

854
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,039
Even that first crappy unit

855
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,799
was canceled.

856
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:49,599
No way.

857
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,200
How come?

858
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,920
D-did you talk to the client?

859
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,039
If you want to talk,

860
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,480
book a visit at the detention center.

861
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:55,519
He’s in.

862
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,559
Tax evasion.

863
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:58,599
Then…

864
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,599
the deposit he paid—

865
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,240
does that count as my sales?

866
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,839
You’re still thinking of that?

867
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,279
If we don’t refund it,

868
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,279
you want the firm investigated too?

869
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,599
Be glad you’re not in trouble.

870
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,839
“Your sales,” huh.

871
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,400
What goes on in your head?

872
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,119
Meng Hang,

873
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,960
you really need to self-reflect.

874
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,240
Look at the kind of clients you find.

875
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,559
Then again,

876
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,799
your professional skills

877
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,799
are plain for all to see—

878
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,720
you’re just not good.

879
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,240
But didn’t you…

880
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,200
say I was a real dark horse?

881
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,279
Dark horse my foot.

882
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,079
I just want you a thousand miles away.

883
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,680
Why are you still standing here?

884
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Get out and find clients.

885
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,079
Okay, okay, got it.

886
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,240
You slack off all day long.

887
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,039
You’re bottom again this month.

888
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,480
And that photo—

889
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,440
take it down.

890
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,960
Meng—

891
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,240
these two are clients

892
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,640
you can sign if you go.

893
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,880
Hurry and close them.

894
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,200
Don’t say

895
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,599
handsome bro never helps you.

896
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:55,839
I’m off.

897
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,599
You’re back.

898
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,160
Sold another place?

899
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,920
How many units today?

900
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,720
Well…

901
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,680
it’s just…

902
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,240
about before—

903
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,799
I was wrong.

904
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,279
I did get a bit swollen-headed.

905
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,480
I’ve treated you badly lately.

906
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,400
I’m sorry.

907
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,400
What’s up, Meng Hang?

908
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,880
Suddenly so self-aware?

909
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,440
I…

910
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,759
uh…

911
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,960
that big deal fell through,

912
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,640
and the promotion’s gone.

913
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,279
I’ve let you down.

914
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:47,960
This

915
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,680
You didn't have to hack at me.

916
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,519
I already knew you blew your promotion.

917
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,559
Thanks to me,

918
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,400
I came prepared.

919
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,240
No, hold up, you—

920
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:57,920
You—

921
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,880
How did you even know?

922
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,119
Your client made the news.

923
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,240
Then why are you holding an axe?

924
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,920
I wanna tell you a story.

925
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,800
When Washington was a kid,

926
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,480
he loved his uncle’s axe.

927
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,159
No, wait—

928
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,280
it was his dad’s.

929
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,119
Not his uncle’s.

930
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,519
He really loved his dad’s axe.

931
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,679
One day,

932
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,440
he secretly took the axe out

933
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,599
and chopped the tree at his gate.

934
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,440
The cherry tree.

935
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,360
Stop reading pirated books, okay?

936
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,039
So you know that story?

937
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,400
Then you know where I’m going.

938
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,280
You’re reading the rip‑off version.

939
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,719
I, uh, I—

940
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,840
I don’t dare just guess.

941
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,039
Then let me keep going.

942
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,239
Later Washington felt

943
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,679
that what he’d done was wrong.

944
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:46,280
So he confessed to his dad.

945
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,559
His dad not only forgave him,

946
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,039
he even took the axe

947
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,000
and gave it to him.

948
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,079
No, no—

949
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,800
W‑what do you mean?

950
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,639
So that means

951
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,440
you’ve

952
00:34:59,199 --> 00:34:59,880
forgiven me?

953
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,039
Forgive you, sure.

954
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,480
But what you did

955
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,800
will pop back up in our

956
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,920
next fight as evidence.

957
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,480
Then I’ll keep this axe on me

958
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,559
all the time,

959
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,559
to remind myself

960
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,599
not to get cocky again.

961
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,159
Thanks.

962
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,480
How about...

963
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,960
you just put the axe down?

964
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:28,239
My neck feels icy right now.

965
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,079
Okay.

966
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,760
I read a story lately.

967
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,599
It was about young Leonardo learning art.

968
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,639
His teacher made him draw eggs daily.

969
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,320
He really didn’t get it.

970
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,119
The teacher told him,

971
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,840
“In this world,

972
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,880
no two eggs are identical.

973
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,639
If you can notice

974
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,480
their tiniest differences,

975
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,159
then whatever you paint later

976
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,400
will be a breeze for you.”

977
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,559
Da Vinci suddenly got it.

978
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,440
He trained hard every day

979
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,920
and became a true master.

980
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,920
That story

981
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,000
really inspired me.

982
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,000
I feel like

983
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,119
observing Earth

984
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,199
is the same thing.

985
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:20,239
So,

986
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,000
I’ve decided

987
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,079
that from now on, each issue

988
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,920
I’ll study this globe.

989
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,719
I’ll examine it a thousand times.

990
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,880
If Earth has any problem later,

991
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
I’ll spot it in a second.

992
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,480
Li Lili.

993
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,039
Are you slacking off?

994
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,719
No.

995
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,000
I’m touching Earth.

996
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,559
See?

997
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,599
You’ve got two options.

998
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,880
Either you ditch that junky globe,

999
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,880
or you ditch this job.

1000
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:44,519
Chief Editor,

1001
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,159
I swear I’m not slacking.

1002
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:48,159
I’m just really moved.

1003
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,039
This is all

1004
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,320
truly from the heart.

1005
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,039
That—

1006
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,280
Just shut up.

1007
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,519
Before tonight,

1008
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,280
turn in a 20,000‑word report.

1009
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,920
Hey, that’s not so bad… right?
