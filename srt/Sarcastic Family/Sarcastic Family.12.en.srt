1
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Fate, you know.

2
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,040
It's not a shooting star.

3
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,439
It's a comet.

4
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,280
Look.

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,040
It flashes by in an instant.

6
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,560
It seems to have gone far away.

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,359
But you never know when,

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,280
it suddenly comes back again.

9
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,280
Bringing warmth

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,639
and sweetness.

11
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,560
I'll kill you, you brat!

12
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,039
What are you doing?

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,159
I'm livestreaming.

14
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,159
There's a

15
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,919
wasp in the house.

16
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,199
Is it as crazy as you?

17
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Did it even bother you?

18
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,199
I got stung by a wasp as a kid.

19
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,159
I had to stay in the hospital for two months.

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
If it weren't for that wasp,

21
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,840
I wouldn't have

22
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,599
missed Peking University by five points.

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,520
Today I have to

24
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,719
get my revenge.

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,360
Can't you see I'm livestreaming?

26
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,120
Is your stream more important, or my revenge?

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Revenge is more important.

28
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,400
I have over a thousand followers.

29
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,759
I'm kind of an influencer, right?

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,879
You, an influencer?

31
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,439
Let me tell you,

32
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,479
real influencers have over ten million followers.

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,479
You only have a thousand.

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,439
That's less than the audience

35
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,840
at our neighborhood party.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,479
A thousand followers...

37
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,120
Can your crappy livestream make money?

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,599
Can your crappy pet shop make money?

39
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,080
At least I don't lose money on it.

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,759
Don't underestimate me.

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm about to earn five hundred thousand.

42
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,800
Five hundred thousand?

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
Are you drunk on fake booze?

44
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,280
What?

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,639
A reward.

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,439
Its fur treatment

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,120
costs more than your hair perm.

48
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,520
I've already sent our shop's most

49
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,439
capable employee.

50
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,599
to handle this.

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm determined to get that five hundred thousand.

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,400
Capable employee?

53
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,400
Li Cai.

54
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,400
He'd be lucky not to lose himself.

55
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,120
You'll have to pay to find him later.

56
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,199
I'm warning you,

57
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,039
don't mess things up again.

58
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,759
Let's continue.

59
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,840
A friend left a comment:

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,599
Life is cruel.

61
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,199
Truth is bare.

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
Who told you to undress on camera?

63
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,199
No, I...

64
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,439
The wasp,

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,800
it crawled into my clothes.

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,840
See?

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,759
The Livey Room got a warning.

68
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,639
Look at this.

69
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:55,960
Go back, go back.

70
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
Hurry back, hurry back.

71
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,159
When I'm livestreaming,

72
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,400
don't come out, you hear me?

73
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,560
You filmed me!

74
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,719
You owe me a portrait fee!

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,759
Go back, now!

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Wasp! Wasp!

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Open the door! Open the door!

78
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,879
No, we agreed—

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,120
Each band member gets five thousand.

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,399
Send it all to my account.

81
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,040
Then I'll transfer it to the record company.

82
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,240
I still haven't got Lao Xiang's money.

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,319
He won't answer my calls.

84
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,240
What does that mean?

85
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,639
Don't count on him.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,439
He won't answer me either.

87
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,000
Remember the song he wrote last month?

88
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,519
You call that a song?

89
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,519
You're my traffic jam,

90
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm your honey-glazed ham.

91
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,319
Let's jingle together.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,800
That song...

93
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,480
He wouldn't get mad just because I said

94
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,920
his song was bad, would he?

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,399
He's not that petty, right?

96
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,759
You don't know—

97
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,879
His song online

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,120
is super popular.

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,639
Lots of short videos

100
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
use his song as background music.

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,079
Are you kidding?

102
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,040
That song is a hit?

103
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,120
Anyway,

104
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,560
he's a big influencer now.

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,040
His livestream sales in one day

106
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,120
make tens of thousands.

107
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,279
Why bother with an album?

108
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,079
Tens of thousands?

109
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,160
Livestreaming makes that much?

110
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,839
Not always.

111
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,879
You need traffic first.

112
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,720
I have traffic!

113
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
My phone

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,279
gets several gigabytes a month.

115
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,600
Not phone data.

116
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,680
You need viewers for your stream.

117
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,600
If no one's watching,

118
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,839
who are you selling to?

119
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,399
Let me roughly estimate

120
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,279
after doing the math.

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,560
Those with a million followers

122
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,879
can sell hundreds of thousands a day.

123
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,920
Your mom only has a bit over one thousand fans,

124
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,319
so she can only sell a few hundred yuan.

125
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,199
But even that

126
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,439
is pretty great.

127
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
Can you help me talk to your mom?

128
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,240
It's such a good opportunity.

129
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,839
You should tell her yourself.

130
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Okay, I'll say it.

131
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,199
It's just...

132
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,480
I feel a bit awkward.

133
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,399
It's kind of embarrassing.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,879
What's embarrassing about earning money livestreaming?

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,199
Lately, we've

136
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,920
mainly had some disagreements.

137
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,600
What kind of disagreement?

138
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,319
I told her

139
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
her crappy livestream doesn't make money.

140
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,240
That was a bit awkward.

141
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,079
Right?

142
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,439
Li Lili

143
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,560
Li Li

144
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,399
You know,

145
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
us old bandmates,

146
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,759
it's really tough running a band.

147
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,160
We haven't made a cent this year.

148
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,720
Why?

149
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,639
We couldn't sell any tickets.

150
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,560
We're chasing art.

151
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,000
Is art something to be sold?

152
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,360
I'd rather sell goods on livestream myself

153
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,439
than sell out my art.

154
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,279
You know what that's called?

155
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,920
Sell the body, not the art.

156
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,040
That's called having a dream.

157
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,399
It's been forty years.

158
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,959
We went from dream-chasing youths

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,399
to dream-chasing elders.

160
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,519
Still haven't made it.

161
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,079
Our dream of releasing an album.

162
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,959
Are we selling goods in our livestreams?

163
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,240
No.

164
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,920
We're mourning.

165
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,319
To honor our lost youth.

166
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,720
Let our youth

167
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,120
be revived through music.

168
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,199
As the saying goes,

169
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,680
the soul of music lingers on.

170
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,680
I get it.

171
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,519
Dad,

172
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,759
don't worry.

173
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,680
To keep your music soul alive,

174
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,439
I'll definitely persuade Mom

175
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,040
to help you earn money livestreaming

176
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,279
and fulfill your album dream.

177
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:53,879
That's great!

178
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,000
Other ways to make money

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,120
we can't give up either.

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,600
We need to try both.

181
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,839
And do both well.

182
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,600
Alright.

183
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Eat, eat, eat.

184
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,720
Come on, come on.

185
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,399
This one's sweet.

186
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,040
This one's tasty.

187
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,600
What's up, Uncle Meng?

188
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:13,920
Guess.

189
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,839
That thing you...

190
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,800
How's your search going?

191
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,399
Guess.

192
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,439
Guess my train, huh?

193
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,399
Just tell me already!

194
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,839
I found one,

195
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,839
a stray,

196
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,800
brown,

197
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,600
furry,

198
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,279
recently lost.

199
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
That's all correct!

200
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,000
Wait, show it to me now.

201
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,759
But...

202
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,639
But what?

203
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,560
Hurry up!

204
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,600
But it's a cat.

205
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,480
Not a dog.

206
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,720
Is this joke funny?

207
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,919
Is it amusing?

208
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,440
No.

209
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,559
I'm not joking.

210
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,759
It seems pretty close to me.

211
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,159
I was thinking,

212
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
let's take it to the shop and keep it for now.

213
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,000
It doesn't eat much cat food anyway.

214
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,200
Forget about the cat for now.

215
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
I told you to find a dog.

216
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,240
Dog, dog, dog, go find a dog!

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:45,919
Don't...

218
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,440
Don't worry about the cat.

219
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,200
Go look for the dog.

220
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,279
You get paid if you find the dog.

221
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,120
Five hundred.

222
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:49,879
Alright!

223
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,600
Let's go.

224
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,399
Not helping, not helping.

225
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,320
He isn't...

226
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,519
He said it.

227
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,279
He found a curly-haired dog.

228
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
Could earn five hundred thousand.

229
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,639
Would even notice my crappy account?

230
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,720
He also said

231
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,480
something about a community party.

232
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,120
Even that has more viewers than my account.

233
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I'm not helping him.

234
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:15,799
Mom,

235
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,720
Meng Hang's dad was just joking around.

236
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,480
Now everyone can earn money together.

237
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,720
Isn't that great?

238
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,320
Can we really make money?

239
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,600
Why not?

240
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,399
My dad's friend Lao Xiang,

241
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,159
you know him, right?

242
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,519
His Livey Room

243
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,320
sells hundreds of thousands a day.

244
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,480
So...

245
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,200
I can make that money too!

246
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Exactly.

247
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,840
So...

248
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,240
Life is just

249
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,159
two lonely hearts

250
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,559
drawing closer together.

251
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,559
What are you doing?

252
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,639
Posting to Moments.

253
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,120
Visible only to Lao Xiang.

254
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,799
He

255
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,279
just lost his spouse.

256
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,919
Oh, come on.

257
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,360
Stop being dramatic.

258
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,279
He just remarried.

259
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,639
Really

260
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,440
not funny.

261
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,879
If you have the time,

262
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,840
think about

263
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,039
how to monetize your few fans.

264
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,960
If you sell products now,

265
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,519
they're all from my dad's shop.

266
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,279
You have zero cost.

267
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,879
So how do we split it?

268
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,480
You and my dad split fifty-fifty.

269
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,360
That works too.

270
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,879
I get ninety-five percent.

271
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,919
He gets half a percent.

272
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,279
Just take it all.

273
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,840
Fine by me.

274
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,919
What do you mean, fine?

275
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,039
Sixty-forty, you get sixty.

276
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,679
One to nine.

277
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,200
I get nine.

278
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,639
Sixty-forty, you get sixty.

279
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,440
It's settled then.

280
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,799
Meng Hang and I did all the work for nothing.

281
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,399
Alright.

282
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,519
Guess I'll take the loss.

283
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,720
What are you up to now?

284
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,799
Let me tell you,

285
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,879
inside this book

286
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,080
red envelopes can grow.

287
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:39,720
I'll show you.

288
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,639
Look, look, look.

289
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,519
See? Look.

290
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,440
So many now.

291
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,120
I found this many.

292
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,519
These are Meng Hang's

293
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,919
red envelopes from childhood.

294
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,399
His dad hid them here.

295
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,159
I discovered them.

296
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,120
One to nine, I get nine.

297
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,480
Welc— Welc—

298
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Welcome, every—

299
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,639
Where were you this morning?

300
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Stop wandering around.

301
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,840
Welcome everyone to my livestream.

302
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,039
What's going on?

303
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,120
Why did it buzz me?

304
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,879
Dad,

305
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,120
um,

306
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,159
You said forbidden words.

307
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,159
You got a warning.

308
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,919
I only said one thing.

309
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,679
How was that forbidden?

310
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,879
You can't say "livestream room."

311
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,039
You have to say "Livey Room."

312
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,600
What is this?

313
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,360
Livestream platform.

314
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,480
They don't allow "livestream room"?

315
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,960
Well,

316
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

317
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,879
Just say it differently.

318
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,279
Welcome everyone to my Livey Room.

319
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,639
Watch my live—

320
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,519
Livey—

321
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,000
Last thing, don't use repeated words.

322
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,080
If you act cute at this age,

323
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,240
it's just gross.

324
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,879
What are you doing?

325
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,759
So many people are watching.

326
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,480
You really shouldn't do that.

327
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,759
You—

328
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,399
What's wrong now?

329
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,679
It's best not to say

330
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,240
this word.

331
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,960
It's easy

332
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
for people to think we're faking it.

333
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,600
I didn't say this product is the best.

334
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,279
I said this—

335
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,960
I—I said she should best be—

336
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,360
Dad, dad, dad—

337
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's, let's—

338
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,960
Let's just turn it off first.

339
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,480
No more talking.

340
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,159
No more.

341
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,919
Saying forbidden words too much

342
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,240
can get you banned.

343
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,840
If the account gets banned,

344
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,799
I'll kill you.

345
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm mute.

346
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,600
Um, so, so, like this—

347
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,440
Let's first—

348
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,039
make a list.

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,279
Let's sum up

350
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,759
which forbidden words we can say,

351
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,639
which we can't.

352
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,600
I'll write it down for you.

353
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,240
Alright.

354
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,720
I see you know livestreams well.

355
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,200
You watch them a lot, right?

356
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,519
Not at all, not familiar.

357
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,200
Occasionally.

358
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,360
I watch a little, sometimes.

359
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,519
But I've never sent them gifts.

360
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:49,759
Them—

361
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,399
Who are they?

362
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,320
Them, well—

363
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,159
They're definitely not boys.

364
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,639
No.

365
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,600
They're definitely

366
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,600
boys.

367
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:57,840
All guys.

368
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,440
Like you, your hometown buddies—

369
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,399
Like Li Zongheng,

370
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,600
and Lao Si.

371
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,200
Yeah, Lao Si.

372
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,080
Last time,

373
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,519
the girl who danced really well—

374
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,679
You sent her a fan lightstick.

375
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,759
Who was that?

376
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,600
Right.

377
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,279
That's Lao Si.

378
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,120
That Lao Si.

379
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,720
He

380
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,120
put on a wig

381
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,440
and danced with people.

382
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,039
See?

383
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,720
None of that matters.

384
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,919
Not important at all.

385
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,519
What matters is

386
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,960
we need to fix the forbidden words.

387
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,559
Right?

388
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,679
I'll hurry and write it down.

389
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,960
You all need to study up.

390
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
What are forbidden words.

391
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,000
Stand right there.

392
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,399
Why is livestreaming so hard?

393
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,200
So many forbidden words?

394
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,200
This is the full list of forbidden words.

395
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,080
This one

396
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,600
is all the forbidden words.

397
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,080
Then just tell us the words

398
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,720
we're allowed to say.

399
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,639
Feels like that's a much shorter list.

400
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,320
It's livestreaming,

401
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,639
so we have to be careful.

402
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,120
You two, please take note of this.

403
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,679
Can't say this, can't say that...

404
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,759
Might as well livestream in sign language.

405
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,200
Yeah, let's just use gestures.

406
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,720
Our dog food

407
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,720
is low-priced.

408
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,759
Then just gesture it.

409
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,000
Your gesture means

410
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,080
I'm worse off than a dog.

411
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,159
You really know sign language!

412
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,879
Yeah.

413
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,279
Let me show you another one.

414
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,399
Me.

415
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,159
Brain, brain.

416
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,879
I understood that one.

417
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,879
She said it's your brain.

418
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,679
I got it too.

419
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,440
No need to translate.

420
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,000
It's waterlogged.

421
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,720
All water.

422
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,879
Hello, everyone.

423
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,279
Welcome to our

424
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,279
Livey Room.

425
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,320
This friend asked how much our dog food costs.

426
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:36,840
Here's the thing.

427
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,159
Our dog food is

428
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,679
sold by the kilo, not by "mi".

429
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,919
"Mi" is for buying fabric.

430
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,519
Not this one.

431
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,600
Not that "mi".

432
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,679
Yes, yes, yes.

433
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,600
That word.

434
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,720
Which one?

435
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,879
Money.

436
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,279
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

437
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,679
Hello, friend.

438
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
Our

439
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,159
dog food is

440
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,840
five kilograms, ninety-nine

441
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,600
mi.

442
00:14:59,679 --> 00:14:59,919
Right.

443
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,000
If you

444
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,320
search the whole internet,

445
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
ours is still the

446
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,200
most

447
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,879
likely cheaper than elsewhere.

448
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,840
A little bit cheaper.

449
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,200
Is that even human grammar?

450
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,960
Aren't we not allowed to say "cheapest"?

451
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,039
I...

452
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:18,720
Let me do it.

453
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:18,960
I'll do it.

454
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,480
Come on, come on.

455
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,120
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

456
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,559
Hello, everyone.

457
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,120
See this dog food in my hand?

458
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,639
Its quality...

459
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,159
is just so-so.

460
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,480
Anyway, it won't kill your dog.

461
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,559
Look.

462
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,840
This is

463
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,840
an electric

464
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,120
cat litter box.

465
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,559
Electric cat litter box.

466
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,799
How is it different from a regular litter box?

467
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,000
Of course it's different.

468
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,840
Because it

469
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,799
uses more electricity.

470
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,559
Look.

471
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,159
There's also

472
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,120
cat toys.

473
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,960
Cats

474
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,679
might not even like them.

475
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,080
But our streamer

476
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,759
definitely loves to play.

477
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,960
Look, look how much fun he's having.

478
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,600
What?

479
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,200
Aren't you—

480
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,360
Yes, yes, yes.

481
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,759
You didn't use any forbidden words.

482
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,200
But people still won't buy our stuff.

483
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,399
Are you helping or making trouble?

484
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,919
Actually, more viewers showed up.

485
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,480
Let me see.

486
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,840
Someone here said—

487
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,120
Uncle Meng is so cute.

488
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,799
Make her laugh again and she'll order.

489
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,679
She called me cute?

490
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,559
Sorry, I'm a little shy.

491
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,679
Yeah, I'm embarrassed.

492
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,519
I'll just go for it.

493
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,080
Whatever, I don't care.

494
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,600
It's all for the sales.

495
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,519
Come on, keep joking.

496
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,159
Keep joking.

497
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,960
Can't reach it.

498
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,799
Where is it? Where?

499
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,120
Over there.

500
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,759
No, it's not.

501
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,759
This side, here, here.

502
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Gone again. Where is it? Where?

503
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Are you really going all out?

504
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,480
Looks like you're enjoying this.

505
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:34,559
Darn it, darn it.

506
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,320
Your moves are way too creepy.

507
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,000
Got a warning, right?

508
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,159
No, Mom—

509
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,559
That's the sound for a successful sale.

510
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,960
Thank you.

511
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,240
Thanks to the user named—

512
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,159
"Peaceful Years" for placing an order.

513
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,600
Thank you, thank you.

514
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,279
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

515
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,360
Friends, friends—

516
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,879
If we get twenty orders—

517
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,919
My dad will immediately—

518
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,200
Climb the cat tree.

519
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,320
Everyone's liking it.

520
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,279
So much popularity.

521
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,679
Top traffic is really something else.

522
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,279
No need to be so enthusiastic, everyone.

523
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Shipping so many orders at once—

524
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,160
The logistics will get seriously jammed.

525
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,000
So many people ordering.

526
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,359
Okay.

527
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,799
Really?

528
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,519
Mom, Mom, Mom—

529
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,240
No, no, no—

530
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:13,599
Got repeated first-level forbidden word warnings.

531
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,160
What did I say?

532
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,240
What did I say?

533
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:17,880
Let me think.

534
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,599
What you just said—

535
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,240
What did I say?

536
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,359
All at once.

537
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,359
All at once.

538
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,759
Sexy.

539
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,359
That can't be it.

540
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,200
There must be more after that.

541
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,720
Let me think.

542
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,079
Logistics jam.

543
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,319
Logistics.

544
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,319
Porn.

545
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,079
No, this—

546
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,279
This counts too?

547
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,680
Yeah, does this count too?

548
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,880
Talk to customer service.

549
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
Try to appeal.

550
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,640
It's useless.

551
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,359
Can't send any messages now.

552
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,680
Why is it blacked out?

553
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,640
It's blacked out.

554
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,960
Locked in the little black room.

555
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,319
Because earlier there were repeated—

556
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,519
Forbidden words piling up.

557
00:17:59,279 --> 00:17:59,720
Now—

558
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,759
The account is banned.

559
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,079
You owe me my account.

560
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,480
Compensate? Compensate for what?

561
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,880
You, you—

562
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,400
This account only had a bit over one thousand fans.

563
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,039
Just apply for another one.

564
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,000
Enough, enough, enough.

565
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,720
I'll give you an extra hundred from today's earnings.

566
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,319
That settles it.

567
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,839
Settled.

568
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,359
What do one thousand fans mean to me?

569
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,039
If each throws me a brick—

570
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,240
I could build a courtyard house.

571
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,200
If each gives me one thousand yuan—

572
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,920
I'd have a million already.

573
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,279
You're extorting me.

574
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,160
Who counts like you?

575
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,799
It's just a crappy account.

576
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,640
Crappy account.

577
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,119
I'm not done with you.

578
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:43,799
Mom.

579
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:44,960
Isn't that a bit much?

580
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,000
What are you doing?

581
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,319
Mom.

582
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,079
When making money—

583
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,720
You can't take crooked paths, right?

584
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,079
They called you a porn streamer.

585
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,720
That's not what I meant.

586
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,079
What are you doing?

587
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,839
Slacking off.

588
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,960
Still haven't found it.

589
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,000
Slacking off again.

590
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm telling you—

591
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,319
If you don't find it, I'll dock your pay.

592
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,039
You only said I'd get a bonus if I found it.

593
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,400
You never said you'd dock my pay if I didn't.

594
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,480
Well, who told you to not meet your KFC?

595
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,359
You mean performance targets, right?

596
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,720
That's what I meant.

597
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:25,599
Just think about it.

598
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,000
How long have you been at the store?

599
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,799
You haven't created any value.

600
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,799
You're getting paid for nothing.

601
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,160
Hurry up and look.

602
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,680
I'm counting on that five hundred thousand to save me.

603
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,400
Uncle Meng, what's wrong?

604
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,319
Cancer?

605
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:36,960
Ptooey, ptooey, ptooey!

606
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,160
Touch wood, touch wood.

607
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,720
How is your imagination so wild?

608
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,119
Enough.

609
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,839
Go, hurry up and get moving.

610
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,200
Go, go, go! Move, move!

611
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:43,799
Hurry up and look.

612
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:49,839
Dad

613
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,200
Let me say this,

614
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
don't put too much pressure on Li Cai.

615
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:54,720
As the old saying goes,

616
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,039
don't try to squeeze blood from a stone.

617
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,680
Isn't your mother-in-law squeezing me dry?

618
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,720
This crappy account with over one thousand fans,

619
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,400
they keep chasing me for compensation every day.

620
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,759
They even chased me all the way to the senior college.

621
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,279
Now, I can't perform at the college party.

622
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,720
They call me a tainted celebrity.

623
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,759
At school,

624
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,519
they limit my spending.

625
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,279
I can't order any dish over one yuan.

626
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,240
Your mom said

627
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,519
each fan is worth twenty yuan.

628
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,599
I had to pay her twenty thousand yuan

629
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:16,599
just to get me out of

630
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,279
the blacklist for untrustworthy people.

631
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,000
No way,

632
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,720
my mom

633
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,039
isn't that too much?

634
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:22,680
Exactly.

635
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,279
How about this,

636
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,960
let's make a new account.

637
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,240
We'll livestream together.

638
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,240
Let's earn the money back.

639
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,680
Is it hard to make a new account?

640
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,000
Not at all.

641
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,000
Right.

642
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,839
Even my mom

643
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,359
can get over one thousand fans.

644
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,000
Why can't the three of us do it?

645
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,880
Yeah.

646
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,200
Exactly.

647
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,519
Of course.

648
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,880
Let's do it, do it, do it.

649
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:45,599
Do it.

650
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:45,880
Hurry up.

651
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,720
Do it, make one.

652
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,240
What's missing?

653
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,240
It's been all morning.

654
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,160
Not a single person showed up.

655
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,880
There was one person.

656
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,359
Didn't you kick them out?

657
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,039
They called me an old fool.

658
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,960
How could I not kick them?

659
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,839
So rude.

660
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,400
It's fine.

661
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,440
Keep going. Persistence is victory.

662
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,440
If we work hard, we'll get results.

663
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,279
Look,

664
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,400
here comes one.

665
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,200
Buy weight loss pills, add QQ number.

666
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,960
That's just

667
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,559
a bot spamming ads.

668
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,519
Then kick it out quickly.

669
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,359
No, no, no.

670
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,440
Don't kick, keep it.

671
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,359
Even a bot is better than no one.

672
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,599
That reminds me.

673
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,839
Why don't we use avatars to livestream?

674
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,279
What do you mean?

675
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,400
That's popular now.

676
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,279
You put two scarecrows in your shop,

677
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,400
just standing there.

678
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,839
Not scarecrows.

679
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:38,720
They're called

680
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,400
VTubers.

681
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,240
It's still us livestreaming,

682
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,160
but viewers see cartoon avatars.

683
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,680
That, that...

684
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,200
I've experienced that before.

685
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,480
Dad, I think it's a good idea.

686
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,400
The few of us

687
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,160
can dress up as little animals.

688
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,400
Doesn't that fit

689
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,680
the pet shop theme perfectly?

690
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:58,599
Really?

691
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,480
Alright.

692
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,119
Let's try.

693
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,000
Let's give it a shot.

694
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,519
I'm the fish.

695
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,240
You're Benbo'erba.

696
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,480
Then who's Baboberben?

697
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,000
Who is that?

698
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,519
Me, I'm Baboberben.

699
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,640
Uh...

700
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,000
What am I?

701
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,319
You're a screwdriver.

702
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:19,839
No way,

703
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,519
weren't we supposed to be animals?

704
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,680
It auto-generated, I don't know how to fix it.

705
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,319
Say something, say something.

706
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,960
Look, the screwdriver is talking.

707
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:37,839
Come out.

708
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,480
I know you're there.

709
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,640
I can feel your emotions.

710
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,200
Do you know

711
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,960
how much effort I put in

712
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,480
just to find you?

713
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,160
I crossed mountains and rivers.

714
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,000
Sympathy.

715
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,799
Why are you sympathizing with me?

716
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,480
Without me,

717
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,279
you'd spend your whole life

718
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,039
as a stray dog digging through trash.

719
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,960
What?

720
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,200
You love digging through trash

721
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,960
because you like junk food.

722
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,000
I like it too.

723
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,400
By the way,

724
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,599
where's your owner?

725
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,720
Does she usually

726
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,200
let you eat junk food?

727
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,400
I get it now.

728
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,519
In human society,

729
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,839
you feel restricted.

730
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,680
Getting your fur styled and wearing clothes

731
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,440
aren't natural for you.

732
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,039
I'll give you freedom.

733
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,960
Go on.

734
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,160
That's nice.

735
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,000
It used to be three people

736
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,359
standing here like fools.

737
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Now it's three

738
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:16,920
monsters

739
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,079
standing here like fools.

740
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,599
Don't lose hope.

741
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,720
I just spent some money.

742
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:22,960
Bought some traffic.

743
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,880
We'll have viewers soon.

744
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,440
Don't just stand here.

745
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,400
Sing a song or something.

746
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,920
Liven up the atmosphere.

747
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,079
Sell cat food.

748
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,799
Sell cat food.

749
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,880
This Livey Room has no traffic.

750
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,720
We can't keep our business going.

751
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,400
Cat food, cat food, sell cat food.

752
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,160
Dad,

753
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,920
sing something a bit more upbeat.

754
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
I'm already singing with a smile.

755
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,480
Isn't that cheerful enough?

756
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,440
Someone actually placed an order.

757
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,519
Thank you.

758
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,599
Thanks to the user named

759
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,720
"Universe's Greatest Demon King."

760
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,960
Thank you, thank you so much.

761
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,119
Thanks.

762
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,680
Placed five hundred orders.

763
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,400
Heh heh heh.

764
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,599
The stock, all the stock is gone.

765
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,680
Uh...

766
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,200
Thank you, thank you.

767
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,680
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

768
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,440
You're our lifesaver.

769
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,079
Thank you.

770
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,400
I told you so.

771
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,240
This is easy, simple.

772
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,759
Your mother-in-law is making a fuss.

773
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,000
Wait, hold on.

774
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,960
Why did you turn it off?

775
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,200
The money's off, this account...

776
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,960
We've only got a little over four thousand.

777
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,039
Darn it.

778
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Darn it, darn it.

779
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,079
When you listed the product,

780
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,640
you added an extra decimal point.

781
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,839
Cat food, ninety-nine per bag,

782
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,039
was sold for nine point nine.

783
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:58,559
Uh...

784
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:00,680
Dad.

785
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,240
Dad.

786
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:01,839
Dad.

787
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,039
Dad.

788
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,240
Hurry.

789
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,680
Should we call 120?

790
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,880
Call!

791
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:14,839
Wu An.

792
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:15,640
Done.

793
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,000
The money for stock came from my buddies.

794
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,440
They pooled it for my album.

795
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,359
How do I explain this?

796
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,319
I contacted that buyer.

797
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,599
He said if we don't ship,

798
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,799
he'll report us for false advertising.

799
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:32,880
Then,

800
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,319
our shop's deposit will be withheld,

801
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,359
and we'll get fined.

802
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,599
The loss will be even bigger.

803
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,200
Give me his address.

804
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,720
I'll go talk to him in person.

805
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,720
It's useless.

806
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,079
He left a roadside

807
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,279
delivery station address.

808
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,640
He doesn't want us to find him.

809
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,200
We...

810
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,759
ran into a professional claim hunter.

811
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,240
You paid for traffic,

812
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,200
and brought in bad luck.

813
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,759
Wait, how is this all my fault?

814
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,160
I just wanted to sell more.

815
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,200
If not for...

816
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,440
Yeah.

817
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,039
If I hadn't messed up the price,

818
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,559
it wouldn't be like this.

819
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,839
It's all my fault, Dad.

820
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,440
This...

821
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,160
Your loss,

822
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,160
I'll take responsibility.

823
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,640
How can I let you bear it alone?

824
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,160
I share the blame too.

825
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,079
Dad.

826
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,799
Li Li and I will

827
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,200
make up the money for you.

828
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,160
Uh...

829
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,359
These two kids...

830
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,119
Really...

831
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,119
You have such a good heart.

832
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,079
I'm already very happy.

833
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,279
And the second half?

834
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,599
If you really give me the money,

835
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:40,799
I'll be

836
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,000
even happier.

837
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,920
Why are you acting so high and mighty?

838
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,319
Then this,

839
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,599
shouldn't you take responsibility?

840
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,319
How can a retired old man handle this?

841
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,119
You're a forced-out old man,

842
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,119
without even a pension.

843
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,519
No, this...

844
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,960
It's their responsibility.

845
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,720
Doesn't that bother your conscience?

846
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,200
Weren't those two doing it for you?

847
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,519
That's why they took it on.

848
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,240
Wasn't it for you

849
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,119
that they did all this?

850
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,480
If you didn't hound me for money daily,

851
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,279
would we rush into livestreaming?

852
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,160
Mistakes happen when you're busy.

853
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,559
How can you blame me?

854
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,519
Who else should I blame?

855
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,640
Are you being reasonable?

856
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,480
How am I not reasonable?

857
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,519
Stop, quit arguing.

858
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,400
About this...

859
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,720
Li Li and I will figure it out.

860
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,880
Collector's edition.

861
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,519
Signed guitar.

862
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,519
Selling with tears.

863
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,599
Dear friends,

864
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,039
Don't miss out as you pass by.

865
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,279
Let's not talk about all the signatures yet.

866
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,079
Let's talk about the year.

867
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,559
A guitar from eighty-three.

868
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,440
Think how much wine from eighty-three costs.

869
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:06,720
This guitar of mine,

870
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
is this price really expensive?

871
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,720
Let's talk about this signature.

872
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,720
This one,

873
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,359
this is

874
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,119
Cui Jian.

875
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,519
His brother,

876
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:21,920
Cui Kang.

877
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,240
Cui Kang's autograph.

878
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,400
Didn't you say this kind of livestream

879
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,240
was super popular?

880
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,359
We need two hundred more gifts to end.

881
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,880
Now we don't even have two gifts.

882
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,599
We'll be streaming until next year at this rate.

883
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,480
Stop blaming me.

884
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,039
Why not warm up while you wait?

885
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
Someone might send gifts any minute.

886
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,880
Warm up? Seriously?

887
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,880
Wearing this feels like an oven.

888
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,319
I'm almost cooked.

889
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,000
There are big names too.

890
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,759
Michael

891
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:54,759
Jackson

892
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:55,759
Grammy Awards

893
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,279
During the performance,

894
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,519
sixth row, center spot, backup dancer.

895
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,920
Julio Diaz

896
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,960
autographed it himself.

897
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:02,480
Look.

898
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,920
He Wu Hu

899
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,359
Thanks to "See You Never Again"

900
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,359
for sending nine hundred ninety-nine glow sticks.

901
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,480
See?

902
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,079
Told you someone would send gifts.

903
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,200
Come on, hurry up!

904
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:13,680
Come.

905
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:14,640
All right.

906
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,359
Start running.

907
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,599
Thank you!

908
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,960
Thanks to "See You Never Again"

909
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,799
for the gifts.

910
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,480
Thanks to "See You Never Again"

911
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,359
for the gifts.

912
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,079
That's great!

913
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,079
Twenty thousand meters!

914
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,799
What's going on?

915
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,359
How much?

916
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,279
Twenty thousand meters.

917
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,160
You've only run two meters.

918
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,839
And you already stopped.

919
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,680
That's a lot.

920
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,039
It's fine.

921
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,720
The more you run, the more you earn.

922
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,519
Keep going!

923
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,720
This guitar is very precious.

924
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,400
Do you think I'm selling it for too much?

925
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,319
Is it expensive?

926
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,319
Let me put it this way.

927
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,759
When I was young,

928
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,799
I carried this guitar

929
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,559
and my son

930
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,119
riding a bike down the road.

931
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,799
One manhole cover wasn't closed.

932
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,240
Bang!

933
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,039
We fell right in.

934
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,559
I grabbed the guitar first,

935
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,480
then pulled out my son.

936
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,920
So tell me,

937
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,960
this guitar—

938
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
I sell it for twenty thousand yuan.

939
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:57,839
Is that expensive?

940
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,240
Hand on your heart,

941
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,319
ask yourself honestly.

942
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,319
Is it expensive?

943
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,960
It's sold.

944
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
Sold it too cheap.

945
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,400
Hang Hang,

946
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,160
you don't need to send me the money.

947
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,839
I've covered the album costs.

948
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,720
Dad,

949
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,400
your

950
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,799
limited edition guitar—

951
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,519
did you sell it?

952
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,599
It's fine.

953
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,680
Let's not talk about the guitar.

954
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,920
Don't be like that, Dad.

955
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,039
Meng Hang and I have a solution.

956
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,480
He'll run a few more marathons.

957
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,720
We'll have enough money.

958
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,720
That's right.

959
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,440
It's okay.

960
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,759
Just talk to the buyer.

961
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,160
Buy the guitar back.

962
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,920
No need, no need.

963
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,519
Really, it's fine.

964
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,599
That's my own problem.

965
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,960
I can't let you pay for it.

966
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,079
It's just a guitar.

967
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:58,559
It's okay.

968
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,079
No need.

969
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,559
Dad.

970
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,119
This kid...

971
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,079
Not all parents

972
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,920
are indifferent to their children.

973
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,759
Li Cai,

974
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,839
come out.

975
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,759
I'm here.

976
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,279
Where's the stuff?

977
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,480
I forgot.

978
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,960
Look at me...

979
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,440
You should've told me.

980
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,319
Why did you come out?

981
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,160
I guessed it—

982
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,000
Old Meng wants to play the good guy.

983
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,640
If he sold the guitar,

984
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,480
he'd

985
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,960
definitely make me look bad.

986
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,640
I can't give him that chance.

987
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,240
So Aunt Cai bought it ahead of time.

988
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,400
She sent it to me.

989
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,839
Uncle Meng,

990
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,440
my mom's amazing.

991
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,359
You bought it?

992
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,559
And you two should quit that crappy livestream.

993
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:09,440
No one's watching.

994
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:10,319
How is no one watching?

995
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,440
I sent all nine thousand flowers.

996
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,680
So you're

997
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,039
"See You Never Again"?

998
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:17,799
See?

999
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,519
I knew you were just pretending.

1000
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,039
When it matters,

1001
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,480
you really care about us.

1002
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,599
You help us through tough times.

1003
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,319
No way.

1004
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,039
I just like watching him run.

1005
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,359
There's a blogger who gets a heart

1006
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,000
for every hundred meters he runs.

1007
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,000
I sent him gifts all the way to Shanhaiguan.

1008
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,720
That's intense.

1009
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:36,519
Give me back the guitar.

1010
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,000
So cute, so cute.

1011
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,039
Adorable!

1012
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,359
Uncle Meng, you're happy too soon.

1013
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,839
There's something even happier outside.

1014
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,599
What a great day.

1015
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,920
Full of surprises.

1016
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,079
Let's go.

1017
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,400
See?

1018
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,240
I scored a real bargain.

1019
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,359
This cat food

1020
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,440
I bought it online, nine yuan ninety per bag.

1021
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,799
Let's sell it.

1022
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,880
We'll definitely make money.

1023
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,559
What a shame.

1024
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,160
I couldn't find that account again.

1025
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,000
Otherwise, I'd have stocked up more.

1026
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,760
You bought it.

1027
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,480
I bought it.

1028
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,360
Dad.

1029
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,840
Uncle Meng.

1030
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,320
Dad.

1031
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,119
Uncle Meng.

1032
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,800
Dad.

1033
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,559
Told you so.

1034
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,920
There's something even happier.

1035
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,199
Dad.

1036
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,840
Reportedly,

1037
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,199
the previous 500,000 yuan reward

1038
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,719
offered by Ms. Liu for her lost dog

1039
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,320
has finally led to her dog's return.

1040
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,639
The helpful citizen who found the dog,

1041
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,320
Mr. Wang,

1042
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,639
was interviewed

1043
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,960
and couldn't stop laughing.

1044
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,800
Therefore,

1045
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,960
our station couldn't further

1046
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,639
learn about his feelings.

1047
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,239
That's a pity.

1048
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,400
What's so pitiful about that?

1049
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,440
Like you'd just happen to find it.

1050
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,800
What?

1051
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,239
If you don't pick something up, it's lost?

1052
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,960
You don't get it.

1053
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,440
That's not what I regret.

1054
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,800
I should've let it run farther.

1055
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,400
Flamingos can live eighty years.

1056
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,280
Impressive, impressive, impressive.

1057
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,639
A thriving, lively family.

1058
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,679
Scan it.

1059
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,199
Didn't we already add each other on WeChat?

1060
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,280
That's the payment code.

1061
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,639
Your cat food debt is settled.

1062
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,480
Pay me back for the guitar.

1063
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
No, I thought that was

1064
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,360
a little peace offering between us.

1065
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,079
Who said we're making peace?

1066
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,320
Well, how about this—

1067
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,480
If Cai Cai finds the dog,

1068
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,719
I'll give you a bigger cut.

1069
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,079
Cai Cai, stop scrolling.

1070
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,840
Go look for the dog now.

1071
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,159
Didn't they already find the dog?

1072
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,280
Then let me check quickly

1073
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,719
if anyone else lost a dog.

1074
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,639
I didn't see anyone else lose a dog.

1075
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,800
I just saw people losing face.

1076
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,440
Hurry, scan it.

1077
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,559
Losing face, gotta find it fast.

1078
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,079
Find it, get paid.

1079
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:55,639
You...

1080
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,960
First of all,

1081
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,880
about you being brought back,

1082
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,880
I express my regret.

1083
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,039
But could you share

1084
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,679
your core thoughts on longing for freedom?

1085
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,000
Regret, my ass!

1086
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,320
I nearly starved those two days on the street.

1087
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,119
Good thing someone brought me back.

1088
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,400
But Li Cai said

1089
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,679
you want a free, unrestrained life.

1090
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,760
No.

1091
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,559
Don't you post moody stuff at midnight?

1092
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,519
Share some music,

1093
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,440
say you want to escape this world.

1094
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,639
Then delete it the next day.

1095
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,920
Who takes that seriously?

1096
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,719
I was just being poetic.

1097
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,800
But this fool took off my collar.

1098
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,119
I almost got locked up as a stray dog.

1099
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,119
Stop the interview. I'll count to three.
