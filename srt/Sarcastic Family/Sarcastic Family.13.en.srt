1
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Stop eating.

2
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,000
The main dish isn't here yet.

3
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,319
You're already full from cold dishes.

4
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,000
I brought you here this time

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,959
just to try their

6
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,079
Squirrel-shaped Mandarin Fish.

7
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,200
It's really delicious.

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,680
Save some room in your stomach.

9
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,280
But their serving speed is way too slow.

10
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,199
I'm getting a bit hypoglycemic.

11
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,680
hole-in-the-wall.

12
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,919
Owner, chef, and waiter are all one person.

13
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,719
Slow serving means it's freshly made.

14
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,120
It's not a pre-made dish.

15
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,159
Look, it's coming.

16
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,319
Come on.

17
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,240
Put it here.

18
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,159
Here it is.

19
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,479
Your Squirrel-shaped Mandarin Fish.

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,800
Wait a moment.

21
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,120
In this Squirrel-shaped Mandarin Fish,

22
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,800
why isn't there a squirrel?

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,319
So if you buy Wife Cake,

24
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,400
should they give you a wife too?

25
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,199
It's fine, it's fine.

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,479
We met because of Wife Cake.

27
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,680
We just got our marriage certificate today.

28
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,000
Then I'll get you two squirrels.

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,280
Boss.

30
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,319
Take your time eating.

31
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,520
Um...

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,280
We arrived first.

33
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,439
Why did their table get served first?

34
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,039
Did you order?

35
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,039
Didn't you order?

36
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,560
We did.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
How did we not order?

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,800
We've been sitting here for ages.

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,919
Just this plate of cucumbers.

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,800
Maybe the internet lagged and the order didn't go through.

41
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,039
What internet?

42
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,400
You wrote this by hand.

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,879
Look.

44
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,479
Squirrel-shaped Mandarin Fish is written here.

45
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,319
You even misspelled "Mandarin Fish."

46
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,159
They were rushing me.

47
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,080
We're all regular customers.

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,000
Aren't you treating us like outsiders?

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll get it for you right away, okay?

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,520
Right, right.

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,560
You can't serve regulars slower.

52
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,439
Your dish takes too long.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,159
How about

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,000
we just cancel it?

55
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,280
Cancel it.

56
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,360
I've already put the fish in the pot.

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,039
You want to cancel now?

58
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,840
What pot? You just said we didn't order.

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,879
I...

60
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,439
Meng, your wife is picking a fight.

61
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:24,919
What?

62
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,639
How is this picking a fight?

63
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,400
No, no.

64
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,400
How about this—

65
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,439
That dish,

66
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,439
we still want it.

67
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,319
Please hurry and make it.

68
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,080
Okay.

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,000
I understand.

70
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,919
Lili.

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,759
Don't argue with him.

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,319
Go on.

73
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,080
All set.

74
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
I'll get it for you.

75
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,520
It's tough for everyone.

76
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,919
What's wrong, still upset?

77
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,919
Just over a dish?

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Do you think what happened today

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,199
is because I like to argue?

80
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,520
I'm not saying you like to argue.

81
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,719
I'm saying don't argue with the boss.

82
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,120
It's not worth it.

83
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,759
I'm still eating here.

84
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,800
It's so awkward.

85
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,879
You're awkward?

86
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm even more awkward today.

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
In front of so many people,

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,879
you side with him, not me.

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,600
He seems like your wife.

90
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,560
I feel like an outsider.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
What are you saying?

92
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,199
Isn't that illegal?

93
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,600
If it were legal, would you live with him?

94
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,759
I'm just joking.

95
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,800
Trying to lighten the mood.

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,279
I think this is serious.

97
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Look at your usual personality—

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,759
You never fight for your own rights.

99
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,800
Over time, everyone thinks you're easy to bully.

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,439
Then you lose your rights for good.

101
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,439
What rights are you talking about?

102
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,560
You're blowing this way out of proportion.

103
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,079
I think it's just a meal.

104
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,399
It's not worth fighting over.

105
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,319
It's not about the meal.

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Right.

107
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,319
It's about the dish.

108
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,240
Come in.

109
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,040
Sis.

110
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,399
I want to take off early today.

111
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,800
Meng Meng asked me to visit his colleague at the hospital.

112
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,160
He said it's really serious.

113
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,079
Didn't I hear you argued with Meng Meng?

114
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,279
It wasn't a big deal.

115
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,639
I guess he asked me out

116
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,040
just to make up.

117
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,639
Making up at the hospital.

118
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,759
Stitching up emotional wounds.

119
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,120
That's pretty romantic.

120
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:36,720
Alright.

121
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,879
There's nothing going on at work anyway.

122
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,319
Go ahead.

123
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,000
Thanks, sis.

124
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:44,800
Lao Cha.

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,439
I heard you're sick.

126
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,439
I brought Lili to visit you.

127
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,600
How did this happen?

128
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,560
It's so serious.

129
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,399
It's hard to explain.

130
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,920
A couple of days ago,

131
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,959
I was eating at a restaurant.

132
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,720
And with the chef there,

133
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,879
I got into an argument.

134
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,439
I complained he was slow serving.

135
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,079
He complained I was rushing him.

136
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,360
So after going back and forth, we ended up fighting.

137
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,040
This really messed me up.

138
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,920
So embarrassing.

139
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,480
So,

140
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,759
people

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,519
should never act on impulse, no matter what.

142
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,480
Getting mad at outsiders is even more pointless.

143
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,279
I'm a living example of that.

144
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,160
A painful lesson.

145
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,040
It was brutal.

146
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,399
Meng Hang,

147
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,199
go buy some fruit for Lao Cha.

148
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
It's not good for us to come empty-handed.

149
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,639
No need.

150
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,480
Lao Cha is not an outsider.

151
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,000
We're all close colleagues.

152
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,360
Right, just get tomatoes.

153
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,279
Go ahead.

154
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,480
Alright.

155
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,959
You two chat first.

156
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,240
Lao Cha,

157
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,560
share your story with Lili.

158
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,319
Got it, got it.

159
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,240
Leave it to me.

160
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,319
It's painful.

161
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,079
To be honest,

162
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,920
how did you get hurt?

163
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,720
I just told the truth.

164
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,040
Stop, stop.

165
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,959
I'm nervous now.

166
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,439
Explain.

167
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:07,959
No,

168
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,519
this is for pain relief.

169
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,720
It's tingling now.

170
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,680
I'll talk, I'll talk.

171
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,360
Say it, say it.

172
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,160
Xiao Meng

173
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,360
agreed to cover my shifts for half a month.

174
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,079
That's why I'm saying all this.

175
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,680
To be his mouth stand-in.

176
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,399
But

177
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,480
I really didn't lie.

178
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,480
A chef really beat me up.

179
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,759
That's why I look like this.

180
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,680
That's the reason.

181
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,439
It's not because I rushed the food.

182
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,399
Then why?

183
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,680
Because

184
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,399
that chef

185
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,199
is my girlfriend's husband.

186
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,240
Lao Cha,

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
you're such a scumbag.

188
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,319
You're so rotten, you attract flies.

189
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,439
Really?

190
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:00,720
Well,

191
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I just didn't shower.

192
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,040
Harmony in the family brings prosperity in all things.

193
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,959
Don't act on impulse.

194
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,560
Take my advice.

195
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,800
You're still giving advice?

196
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,639
Lao Cha said it well.

197
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,839
Did he say it well, or did you teach him well?

198
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,720
Did I teach him?

199
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,439
You did.

200
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,000
What did I teach?

201
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,319
Even your looks teach him.

202
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,839
I think

203
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,759
you must be honest with your wife.

204
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,960
If today

205
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,639
you can lie to her about this,

206
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,960
you'll lie to her about other things in the future.

207
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,440
Me,

208
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,240
no matter how many benefits you offer,

209
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,960
I won't go against my conscience.

210
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,080
and tell lies.

211
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,159
Straightforward.

212
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,600
It's useless, useless.

213
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,480
I'm leaving now.

214
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,759
You two keep discussing.

215
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,759
Don't get mad.

216
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,360
Take it slow on the way.

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,799
This day...

218
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,759
Are you crazy?

219
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,000
Would I come to the hospital if I wasn't sick?

220
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,639
No,

221
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,120
she just pinched my IV tube.

222
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,080
This...

223
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,679
I'm nervous now.

224
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,679
It's swollen.

225
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,039
Today,

226
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,320
I'll read a submission to everyone.

227
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,879
It goes like this:

228
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,200
My husband is really timid.

229
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,679
He always gets lectured by others outside.

230
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,559
He doesn't even dare to rush a dish at a restaurant.

231
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,240
But he comes home and lectures his wife.

232
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,720
He's got a whole routine.

233
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,919
He even finds a partner to trick me.

234
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,360
That's not okay.

235
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,399
Mom, who submitted this?

236
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,320
It's pretty unique.

237
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
It was just written on a piece of paper and left on my desk.

238
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,879
Isn't that from Li Lili?

239
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,879
Your analysis makes sense.

240
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,600
Don't help her here.

241
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,279
You're criticizing me indirectly.

242
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,120
Lili hasn't talked to me for two days.

243
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,039
Can you help me too?

244
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,320
Why?

245
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
Just because of a dish.

246
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,120
That day,

247
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,200
we planned to eat together.

248
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
After we arrived,

249
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,559
this happened.

250
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,799
Such a small thing.

251
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,559
Mom,

252
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,440
You always help others solve problems.

253
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,720
Can you help me this time too?

254
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,600
Don't worry.

255
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,200
I'll help you solve it.

256
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,799
About this dish...

257
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Here's the situation.

258
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,679
No.

259
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,440
Anyway, I can't get a refund.

260
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,000
That's not how it is.

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,639
I—I'll do it.

262
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,960
I'm not refunding today's dish.

263
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,320
I'm refunding the dish my daughter—

264
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,519
No one can help today.

265
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,639
This is the first time I've heard

266
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,759
of someone refunding a dish before ordering.

267
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm not refunding today's order.

268
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
It's the dish my daughter ordered last time.

269
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,919
Who knows who your daughter is?

270
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,759
My daughter is Li Lili.

271
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,600
Li Lili or whatever...

272
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,519
Stop making things up here.

273
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,399
Stop filming, stop filming.

274
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,679
There are so many people in my restaurant.

275
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,600
No, you can't be unreasonable.

276
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,919
You need to fix this, Mom.

277
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,559
Why are you here?

278
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,799
Is this your mom?

279
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,080
What's wrong?

280
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,039
She wants a refund.

281
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,399
I'm helping you with your problem.

282
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
I asked you to solve Li Lili's issue.

283
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,879
Not the dish problem.

284
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,120
If the dish is sorted,

285
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,399
your couple's issue is sorted.

286
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,519
Stay out, let me handle this.

287
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,679
Mom.

288
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,639
Today's dish—

289
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,519
If you don't refund me,

290
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,559
this business—

291
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,720
I'll make sure you can't run it.

292
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,360
No, no, no.

293
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,559
I'm telling you now.

294
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,639
Today's dish—

295
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,279
can't be refunded.

296
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,080
You two—

297
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,799
just refund first.

298
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,320
No need to get physical.

299
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,720
Did I get physical?

300
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,519
Aren't I standing here?

301
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,480
No, just now—

302
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,240
I said this dish can't be refunded.

303
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,080
And you two—

304
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,039
No need to act it out again.

305
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,799
Um...

306
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,399
My mom—

307
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,720
has mental issues.

308
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,679
Hurry up.

309
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,559
Refund me first.

310
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,440
I'll pay you back later.

311
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,600
Quick, quick, quick.

312
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,879
Refunded, refunded.

313
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,480
Here.

314
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,360
Transfer to me.

315
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,480
Transfer to my mom, quick.

316
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,039
Okay.

317
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,720
You scan first.

318
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,279
WeChat payment received.

319
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,080
We're leaving.

320
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,919
What a mess.

321
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,759
Let's go.

322
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,519
Meng.

323
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,159
Boss just got off work?

324
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,279
Off work? Off work...

325
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,039
Didn't you see? We're closed.

326
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,759
How could it be closed?

327
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,240
You have the nerve to ask?

328
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,000
You just had to refund the dish.

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,080
It's just a few dozen yuan.

330
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
Whole family had to get involved.

331
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,600
Isn't this just screwing me over?

332
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,120
No.

333
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,679
I don't get it.

334
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,639
How is your closure related to my refund?

335
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,639
Wasn't it that day?

336
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,879
An old lady came.

337
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,120
Your mom.

338
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,639
She made a big fuss.

339
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,200
Everyone joined the commotion.

340
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,080
Even the Market Supervision Bureau noticed.

341
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,799
Didn't you get your refund?

342
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,399
Yeah.

343
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,919
That was settled.

344
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,000
But they found something else.

345
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,759
My Hygiene License—

346
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,679
expired.

347
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,480
Just one day overdue.

348
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,919
Closed for a week for rectification.

349
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,240
Sorry.

350
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,360
Enough.

351
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,320
Look at the trouble this caused.

352
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,759
What a hassle for others.

353
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,960
You could've at least apologized.

354
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,039
Why should I apologize?

355
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,080
His license expired.

356
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,360
It's not my fault.

357
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,759
If it weren't for this,

358
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,679
he wouldn't have been investigated.

359
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,600
Now the boss—

360
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,120
has no income for a week.

361
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,080
Are you happy now?

362
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,360
Don't you feel even a little bad?

363
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,399
Whether I feel bad or not—

364
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,879
Is this my fault?

365
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,000
He has no income for a week.

366
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
Wasn't it my mom who made a scene?

367
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,039
I didn't tell her to do it.

368
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,559
If you hadn't made a fuss,

369
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,159
none of this would've happened.

370
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,159
What did I fuss about?

371
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,600
I was fighting for you.

372
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,320
Didn't you let him bully you?

373
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,600
I got bullied?

374
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,399
Fighting for me?

375
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,440
Did I ask you to fight for me?

376
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,240
Fine, take it or leave it.

377
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,399
Dad

378
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,159
This time, Lili really seems mad.

379
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,879
She sleeps in her mom's room every night now.

380
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,480
No, about this...

381
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,840
If it were you, what would you do?

382
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,759
Back then,

383
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,639
your mom often argued with me.

384
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,919
Every time,

385
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,679
I was always the first to give in.

386
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:46,960
Dad,

387
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,360
I get it now.

388
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,399
You don't get a damn thing.

389
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,559
You get it?

390
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:54,960
Let me tell you,

391
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,000
this is why your mom and I

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
ended up divorced.

393
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,360
You can't repeat my mistakes.

394
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,879
This isn't about attitude.

395
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,200
It's a matter of principle.

396
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,720
Think about it.

397
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,559
If you give in now,

398
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,360
in the future,

399
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,440
she'll make a fuss over everything.

400
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,919
Who could stand that?

401
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,519
Right?

402
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,840
Let me ask you this—

403
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,440
You and her,

404
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,080
do you want to end up like me and your mom,

405
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,519
divorced, done with each other?

406
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,519
So, no way.

407
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,960
You have to listen to me on this.

408
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,200
You just won't listen to me.

409
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,120
On this backward planet,

410
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,399
where can you find anyone advanced?

411
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,320
You're just a turtle eyeing a green bean.

412
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,440
Don't drag me in when you insult him.

413
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,960
You can doubt Meng Hang,

414
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,639
but don't question my taste in husbands.

415
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Meng Meng,

416
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,919
he's just used to being the nice guy.

417
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,360
Like, when we have a conflict,

418
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,399
he's always the first to give in.

419
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,000
But this time,

420
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,720
he's really not backing down.

421
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,679
No way.

422
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Just wait and see.

423
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,480
I'll give him an out soon.

424
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,360
He'll definitely apologize first.

425
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,200
You must not apologize first.

426
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,960
Wait for her to talk to you.

427
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,320
Okay.

428
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,400
It's pretty quiet at the table today.

429
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,720
Some people...

430
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,759
Don't you want to say something?

431
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,759
Sounds like there's a noise.

432
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,759
What noise?

433
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,920
The sound of a slap in the face.

434
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,519
Not eating anymore?

435
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,400
I'm full.

436
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,160
Your trick didn't work either.

437
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,119
Why do I feel she's even angrier?

438
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,200
She tried to talk to you, and you ignored her.

439
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,519
How could she not be mad?

440
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,799
That counts as her making the first move?

441
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,759
What else would it be?

442
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,519
Some people, some people...

443
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,240
Who are these "some people"?

444
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,039
Me, obviously.

445
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,759
Wasn't that giving you an out?

446
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,519
I get it now.

447
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:22,720
I'll go now.

448
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,680
Wait, wait, wait.

449
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,960
You missed your chance to take the out.

450
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
Now the out's gone, and you go?

451
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,519
You'll just end up falling flat on your face.

452
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,799
Take the out when it's offered.

453
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,200
You've rolled out the red carpet,

454
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,000
but he still won't walk on it.

455
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,400
I get it now.

456
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,119
He's just chickened out.

457
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,519
He's afraid to bring it up,

458
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,599
worried we'll argue again.

459
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,920
So he just ignores it.

460
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,240
Keep telling yourself that.

461
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,680
You'll get slapped in the face again.

462
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,200
Next time, he'll pretend it never happened.

463
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,440
He won't dare bring it up again.

464
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:54,759
Tomorrow,

465
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,200
you should talk to her about it.

466
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,079
Sooner or later,

467
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,559
you'll have to clear the air.

468
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,759
Now it's my turn to make the first move?

469
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,119
Didn't I already do that once?

470
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,160
It's your turn now.

471
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,559
But we can't stir things up.

472
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,400
We need to

473
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,920
keep it light and funny.

474
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,039
Talk about it with a natural expression.

475
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:09,519
Only then

476
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,079
can you break the awkwardness.

477
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,359
Witty and humorous.

478
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,079
Natural expression.

479
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
This tofu is a bit bland.

480
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,920
That's fermented tofu.

481
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,400
How can your taste be so strong?

482
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,400
Yeah, this dish—

483
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,920
it really is a bit salty.

484
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,079
Well...

485
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,160
I need to remake it.

486
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,279
Otherwise,

487
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,240
she'll

488
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,000
send the dish back again.

489
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,000
Who are you mocking now?

490
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,559
I was pretty funny just now.

491
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,839
That line was pretty funny.

492
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,200
Am I not funny?

493
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
What you do, that's called—

494
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,680
being sarcastic.

495
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,519
Meng Hang's not bad.

496
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,720
He's learned my art of language.

497
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,079
Art of language, huh?

498
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,359
Next time, I'll show him

499
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,920
the art of body language.

500
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,880
Violence isn't classy.

501
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,680
Then I'll use silent treatment.

502
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,640
If he doesn't apologize,

503
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,440
I'll never speak to him again.

504
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,000
Dad,

505
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,039
I know what the problem is now.

506
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,839
Where is it?

507
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,920
You.

508
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,119
Me.

509
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,039
You keep giving me bad advice.

510
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,279
This kid...

511
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,160
I should give Li Lili

512
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,880
No, no, no.

513
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,960
A true lesson in one sentence.

514
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,680
Fake lessons fill ten books.

515
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,400
I may be a bad example,

516
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,720
but I'm still an example.

517
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,079
She's angry right now.

518
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,279
She won't listen to anything you say.

519
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,160
Wait until she talks to you.

520
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,880
Then apologize properly.

521
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,279
And it'll all be over.

522
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,559
My...

523
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,119
foot—

524
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,359
When will it move back?

525
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,839
It can't move back anymore.

526
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,000
We can't keep going on like this.

527
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,880
We're almost like strangers now.

528
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:25,000
She just keeps ignoring you?

529
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,400
I even passed her notes.

530
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,319
She didn't respond either.

531
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,759
That shouldn't be happening.

532
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,720
The urgent thing now is

533
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,200
to get her to move back in with you.

534
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,160
Once you're sharing a room,

535
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,200
how could you not talk?

536
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,160
Once you talk, the problem will pass.

537
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,759
So when should I ask her

538
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,440
to move back in with me?

539
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,200
This

540
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,759
can't wait.

541
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,359
Don't wait for the right moment.

542
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,039
Just tell her at dinner.

543
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:50,960
These past days,

544
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,680
the atmosphere at home is awkward.

545
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,480
You see,

546
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,240
find a chance to make up.

547
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,440
Mom, that doesn't sound like you.

548
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,960
I'm just thinking, if you two split up,

549
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,799
how much would moving cost?

550
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,839
Would he really kick us both out?

551
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,839
Stop saying "us both" all the time.

552
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,599
It's you and him who split up.

553
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,640
You move out.

554
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,200
I have no beef with him.

555
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,519
I'm staying right here.

556
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,519
Fine.

557
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,920
I don't buy it.

558
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,279
If he tells me to leave,

559
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,480
I'll move out right away.

560
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,000
You've been proven wrong before.

561
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,039
Don't let me hear that again.

562
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:26,920
Bang.

563
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:28,960
Bang.

564
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,160
I'm telling you,

565
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,400
you and Mom living in that room

566
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,240
isn't really working.

567
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,160
Did you hear that?

568
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,880
Your love went from touching

569
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
to literally kicking people out.

570
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,920
Right.

571
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,680
I feel the same way.

572
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,640
Yeah, we can't drag this out.

573
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,960
We need to fix this.

574
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,079
Right.

575
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,599
I also think we should

576
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,559
take some time apart to cool off.

577
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,160
I'll stay at your place for now.

578
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,279
Sorry for the trouble.

579
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,680
I've already found a place.

580
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,200
No time like the present.

581
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,119
I'll move out right now.

582
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,640
Where did you find a place?

583
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,759
Moving company, right?

584
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,759
I want to book a truck.

585
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,000
I need it now.

586
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,839
The sooner, the better.

587
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,960
Building 8, Unit 701, West District, Fanhuali.

588
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,319
Wait, wait, wait.

589
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,079
Okay, okay, fine.

590
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,119
Don't be impulsive.

591
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,079
Let's talk calmly.

592
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,359
If talking doesn't work, we can sing.

593
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:41,839
Right?

594
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,000
Dad, Dad, Dad.

595
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,079
Is this really necessary?

596
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,200
It is.

597
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,480
And since we've broken up,

598
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,039
some things need to be settled.

599
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,240
I bought this kettle.

600
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm taking it with me.

601
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,000
You're serious?

602
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,720
I bought those clothes for you.

603
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm taking them.

604
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,680
So we're splitting things?

605
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,400
Fine then.

606
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,559
I'll return the clothes you bought me first.

607
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,480
Everything else, we split fifty-fifty.

608
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:36,759
Wait,

609
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,519
you two acting like this

610
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,440
isn't good.

611
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,839
Dad, stay out of it.

612
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,440
No,

613
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:42,640
this

614
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,799
gourd

615
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:45,640
is mine.

616
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,240
I've polished it for six years.

617
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,400
Three more years to go.

618
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,359
Can't you split something valuable?

619
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,160
Alright.

620
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,880
I want this sofa.

621
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,359
Fine, you can have the sofa.

622
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,359
But let me tell you,

623
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,359
on this sofa

624
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,880
are all our happy movie nights together.

625
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,599
I don't want it anymore.

626
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,960
It's all yours.

627
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,480
That's low.

628
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,799
I want this bowl.

629
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,839
Take it.

630
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Isn't this the bowl you used

631
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,359
to make instant noodles for me the first time?

632
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,480
To be honest with you,

633
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,839
I'd already eaten that day.

634
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't want it.

635
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,960
I want this puzzle.

636
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,440
Coming, coming, coming.

637
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,680
Who is it?

638
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:03,880
Hello.

639
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,599
Are you

640
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,640
from the moving company?

641
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,680
What are you moving?

642
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,000
All this stuff.

643
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,839
Starting price is fifteen hundred per truck.

644
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,160
That's so expensive!

645
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,799
Why don't you just rob me?

646
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,400
You don't have to move.

647
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,480
Cancel the order on the app.

648
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,279
But there's a five hundred service fee for coming out.

649
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,920
You have to pay that.

650
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,200
Five hundred?

651
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,680
Five hundred is a bit much.

652
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,960
Five hundred just for showing up?

653
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,960
Who made that rule?

654
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,680
Is it the business bureau or the tax office?

655
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,440
I'll call and complain about you, believe it or not.

656
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,400
Wait, what do you do?

657
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,839
No one else is complaining.

658
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,000
You're the only one nitpicking.

659
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,240
Scan the code, five hundred.

660
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:40,839
Wait a second.

661
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,000
What do you mean, nitpicking?

662
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:46,000
I've learned something these days.

663
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,319
Some things

664
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,440
you have to fight for.

665
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,599
If you don't, they're gone.

666
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,839
She's not moving anymore.

667
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,680
You guys can leave now.

668
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,680
Are you moving or not?

669
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,559
In our business, we never leave empty-handed.

670
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,599
You owe us five hundred yuan.

671
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:05,920
Thief!

672
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:06,880
Can't leave with nothing.

673
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,599
Go find whoever's moving.

674
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,039
Get out.

675
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Without that five hundred, we can't do this.

676
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,640
Get out.

677
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,480
Alright, alright, alright.

678
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,680
You haven't moved anything.

679
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,319
Right?

680
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,440
How about half price?

681
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,160
Two hundred fifty.

682
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,680
We can't accept that price.

683
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,759
The three of us can't split it.

684
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,799
You have to pay two hundred forty.

685
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,960
I just have one hundred eighty.

686
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,960
Plus three concert tickets for you.

687
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,519
One hundred eighty.

688
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,240
Come on, come on.

689
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880
A rock superstar will hand them to you.

690
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
Come on, come on.

691
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,799
Bro, you play rock music?

692
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,200
What's the point of playing it?

693
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,200
Did I try hard enough this time?

694
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,559
Sorry.

695
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,000
Say it again.

696
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,880
I like hearing it.

697
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,720
Let's talk inside.

698
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,000
No way.

699
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,640
If you don't say it,

700
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,880
I'm not going in.

701
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,039
Who split my God of Wealth in half?

702
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,000
Let's just talk inside.

703
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,000
About this matter...

704
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,359
It proves what I've always thought.

705
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,680
What Earthlings call feelings

706
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,279
are really just impulses.

707
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,880
One impulse, they're together.

708
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,559
Another impulse, they break up.

709
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,839
Overall,

710
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,880
it's childish.

711
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,200
And thoughtless.

712
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,880
What?

713
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,319
You and my dad never argue?

714
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:40,960
Look at you.

715
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,079
You never married on the home planet.

716
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:43,880
You don't get it, do you?

717
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,720
On our planet, we don't like to argue.

718
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,319
If there's conflict, we duel.

719
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,319
Whoever gets killed is in the wrong.

720
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,599
It's fine.

721
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,359
Just toss them in the regeneration chamber.

722
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,839
Our medical tech is advanced.

723
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,559
See my head here?

724
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,400
It's already my sixth one.

725
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,960
A gentleman argues with words, not fists.

726
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,039
Better not fight.

727
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,880
We argue too.

728
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,359
Home planet.

729
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,759
We have mind reading.

730
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:10,839
Everyone curses in their mind.

731
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,720
The other side hears it anyway.

732
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Just watch.

733
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,759
It's all very dignified.

734
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,799
How did I end up with such a silly daughter?

735
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,559
Two years away and you forgot our home planet's culture.

736
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,039
You really think you're a spiritual Earthling now.

737
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,000
You're just worshipping foreign things.

738
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,359
Alright, alright, enough.

739
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,319
No, no need to show off.
