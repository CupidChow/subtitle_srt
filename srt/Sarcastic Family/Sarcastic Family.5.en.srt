1
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm into emotional rock music.

3
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,959
Depression.

4
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,120
So depressed.

5
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,159
People like us,

6
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,680
who do art,

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,840
are especially prone

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,879
to depression.

9
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,200
Taking handfuls

10
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
of medication.

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,719
Aren't you taking metformin?

12
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,799
Isn't that for diabetes?

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,480
Can you stop messing around?

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,800
The one who spoke just now

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
is our housekeeper.

16
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,039
Right, where were we?

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,639
We were talking about your depression.

18
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,000
I just like melancholic men.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,680
They seem so deep.

20
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,479
Yeah.

21
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,639
Just like

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,599
Freddie Mercury.

23
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,719
His song,

24
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,599
Colombian Rhapsody.

25
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,879
The one he wrote,

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,759
it's

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
Pakistani Rhapsody.

28
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,599
In-law.

29
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,520
Look at that British Shorthair,

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,319
meowing, meowing, meowing.

31
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:37,879
What's it called?

32
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,240
My thoughts are all interrupted.

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
It's in heat, obviously.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,280
Always thinking about finding a mate.

35
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,360
So annoying.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,439
I'll get it fixed one day.

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Who are you talking about?

38
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,479
Whoever feels guilty, that's who.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,400
I'm saying, will you ever stop talking?

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Is this your shop

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,319
or is it mine?

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,919
You just boss me around.

43
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,400
I hired you to help out,

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
not to argue with me.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,719
I...

46
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,960
Let me take a look.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
Revealed your true self, huh?

48
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,800
You're a cat spirit!

49
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,039
No, you're not any better.

50
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,719
This is the real us.

51
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,120
Why did she hang up?

52
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,120
Hung up.

53
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,000
What are you doing?

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,639
Can you please stop messing around?

55
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,280
Seriously.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,240
Online dating at your age?

57
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,919
That's embarrassing.

58
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,639
I'm embarrassed?

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,400
I...

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,759
This...

61
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,599
She's a female friend I met on a music forum.

62
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,680
She can compose music.

63
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,639
I want her to write a song for our band.

64
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,199
Right?

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,080
And she doesn't charge.

66
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,400
So when necessary,

67
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,120
of course I have to show my charm.

68
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,439
It's business.

69
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,840
At your age,

70
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,319
what charm are you showing?

71
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,840
Show your medical records instead.

72
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:43,599
You...

73
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,039
You...

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't look down on me.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,199
I'm telling you, I've never lied to her.

76
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:46,960
See?

77
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,039
I didn't lie to her.

78
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,080
How old are you?

79
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,639
Listen,

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
how old do I sound?

81
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,960
Did I lie to her?

82
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,680
I didn't, right?

83
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,599
Early thirties, maybe.

84
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
You seem pretty mature.

85
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,280
I didn't say anything.

86
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,919
I just chuckled.

87
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,680
Did I lie to her?

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,360
I've really learned something.

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,479
Don't deny.

90
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,159
Don't admit.

91
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,879
Don't take responsibility.

92
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,719
That's typical human

93
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,479
scumbag behavior.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
She deleted me.

95
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,720
You compensate me.

96
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,959
Compensate you for what?

97
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,839
Go confess at the police station with you?

98
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,000
Fraudster.

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,480
You, you apologize to her.

100
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,399
Make her add me back.

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,439
How big is your face?

102
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,879
Size forty-five?

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,439
Alright, alright.

104
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,160
Apologized.

105
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,360
I deleted her too.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,160
So you won't be upset.

107
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,639
You...

108
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,399
The diamond on this ring

109
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,800
is so big.

110
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,160
It must be really expensive.

111
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,519
Let me tell you,

112
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,560
in front of my boss,

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,519
I endured hardship and waited.

114
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I swallowed my pride and carried the burden,

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,560
all for this moment.

116
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,120
So I could give you the best.

117
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:12,839
Expensive.

118
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,079
How much more expensive could it be?

119
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,240
Look.

120
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,560
This one.

121
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,519
This one's nice.

122
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,600
This one looks good too.

123
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,839
Eighty-eight thousand.

124
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:28,839
This...

125
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,360
We still need to

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,800
compare with other stores.

127
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,319
Right?

128
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,040
You think it's too expensive.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,519
Mom,

130
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,759
this diamond ring

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,120
is just a formality.

132
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,040
See?

133
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,639
Not answering my question directly.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,959
What's this?

135
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,000
Not admitting it.

136
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,120
Not denying it.

137
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,120
Not taking responsibility.

138
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,279
Scumbags all use the same tricks.

139
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,680
Wait...

140
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,360
How did I become a scumbag again?

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,519
See?

142
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,639
Changing the subject, right?

143
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,879
Not talking about the ring anymore.

144
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm not the one changing the subject.

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,399
Didn't you bring up scumbags?

146
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,319
Fine then.

147
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,439
Let's

148
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,279
keep talking

149
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,319
about the diamond ring.

150
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,040
Are we buying it or not?

151
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:13,879
Buy.

152
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,439
We definitely have to buy it.

153
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:16,920
But...

154
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,839
Which one should we buy?

155
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,079
Can't just decide randomly.

156
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,519
We need rational consumption.

157
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,199
See?

158
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,199
You're still not answering me directly.

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,879
I, uh...

160
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,399
Lili, help me out here.

161
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,240
Don't bother with her.

162
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,879
That's just how she is.

163
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,839
See?

164
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,240
Lili didn't deny me directly either.

165
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,040
Think about it yourself.

166
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,839
Buy.

167
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,680
I didn't say I was buying.

168
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,639
I'm just looking.

169
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,519
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

170
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,279
Just looking.

171
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,959
Buy it and admire it at home.

172
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,079
Meng Hang,

173
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,519
even if we have money,

174
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,199
we still need rational consumption, right?

175
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,959
My idea of rationality

176
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,199
is just to consume.

177
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,279
Let's start the debate.

178
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,160
Cai Xiaoying,

179
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,720
go ahead.

180
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,800
Wanting to buy a ring is a good attitude.

181
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,399
But...

182
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,399
Attitude without action

183
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,079
is just

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,920
empty promises.

185
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,639
I didn't say I wouldn't buy.

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,319
I'm just delaying the purchase.

187
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:17,879
In the end,

188
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,600
I still

189
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,680
will buy it.

190
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,439
Everyone, please note:

191
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,560
My opponent

192
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,480
is confusing a concept.

193
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,319
Buy

194
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,199
and will buy

195
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,399
one word apart,

196
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,720
worlds apart in meaning.

197
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,560
Buy

198
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,879
is present tense.

199
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,839
Will buy

200
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,039
uses present tense

201
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,360
to describe the future.

202
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,879
What is the future?

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,720
The future is

204
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,759
an uncertain time.

205
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,159
If someone comes up to you now and says,

206
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,600
"I'll buy you a diamond ring in the future,"

207
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,559
what does that mean?

208
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,039
It means

209
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,200
he'll never buy you a diamond ring.

210
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,600
I...

211
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,919
That's not what I meant.

212
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,080
I think...

213
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,200
I think

214
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,399
you should just

215
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,960
pay by card right now.

216
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,240
But I...

217
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,200
But you don't want to buy it.

218
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,759
Why don't you want to buy it?

219
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,240
Because you don't want to get married.

220
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,080
Why don't you want to get married?

221
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,960
Because you're afraid of commitment.

222
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,159
Why are you afraid of commitment?

223
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,879
Because you're irresponsible.

224
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,279
Why are you irresponsible?

225
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,799
Because of paternal inheritance.

226
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,440
Lili,

227
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,320
please help me out here.

228
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,879
What's going on with you two?

229
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,399
Yuanyuan,

230
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,399
what do you think of me

231
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,159
as a person?

232
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,240
Then what do you think of Liao Kai?

233
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,480
What's it to you?

234
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,799
Little Meng,

235
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,639
I seriously suspect

236
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,279
Yuanyuan and Liao Kai

237
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,240
have something going on.

238
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,879
How come you're not interested

239
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,159
in such serious gossip?

240
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,679
Meng,

241
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,440
why do I feel

242
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
you've been down lately?

243
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,559
What's wrong?

244
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,120
Don't even mention it.

245
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,320
My mother-in-law moved in with us.

246
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,360
And

247
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,960
she's got a sharp tongue.

248
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,080
A real viper.

249
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,320
Then get her a snake-taming hat.

250
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,000
Even Master Fahai couldn't help.

251
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,840
Darn it.

252
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,879
Her words are vicious.

253
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,279
She roasts me every day.

254
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,679
My wife doesn't back me up.

255
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,159
And my dad's no help either.

256
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,919
I feel like I'm getting depression.

257
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,519
That's no small problem.

258
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,399
Lately,

259
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,679
have you lost interest

260
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,799
in everything?

261
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,840
Kind of.

262
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,039
Do you feel life is meaningless?

263
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,480
Honestly, yes.

264
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,799
Even

265
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,759
the two hundred I owe you,

266
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,600
you don't even want it back.

267
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,360
Not true.

268
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,799
Money's different.

269
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,320
This is a mental issue.

270
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,879
It's serious.

271
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,559
About the money,

272
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,279
you have to do as I say.

273
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,480
Mental health

274
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,639
is a big deal.

275
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,480
With you like this,

276
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,519
I

277
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,639
know a psychologist.

278
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,320
I'll send you the address now.

279
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,080
You know a psychologist?

280
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,360
Mention me,

281
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,480
you'll save two hundred.

282
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,240
Really?

283
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:47,600
Thanks.

284
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:49,679
You're a real bro.

285
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:51,960
Alright.

286
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,360
So,

287
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,000
Saving that two hundred counts as me paying you back.

288
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,639
Darkness.

289
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,320
Endless darkness.

290
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,120
Might summon the wolves.

291
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
Others' voices are kissed by angels,

292
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,480
yours is chewed by a husky.

293
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,200
Shishi.

294
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
That's the vibe, more or less.

295
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,080
Not sure if it's right, you decide.

296
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,519
The next lyrics,

297
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,960
help me write and arrange them.

298
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,159
I want to fight the world's darkness too,

299
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,600
but all I get is

300
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,519
sleepless nights,

301
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,440
hard to swallow.

302
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,559
No idea who ate those three buns at lunch.

303
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,639
Shishi.

304
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Wait for me a sec.

305
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,159
Let me battle this endless darkness.

306
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,840
What are you doing? What are you doing?

307
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,639
Can you not butt in?

308
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,320
I don't need a sidekick when talking to a lady.

309
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,159
You chat one away, then another.

310
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,200
You never leave empty-handed.

311
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,879
Bet you didn't expect that.

312
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,080
That's the one from before.

313
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,799
She deleted me by accident before.

314
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,000
Now she added me back.

315
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,919
She said,

316
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,200
pretty faces are all the same,

317
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,639
depressed souls are one in a million.

318
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,279
Let me tell you,

319
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
she and I

320
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,559
really click.

321
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,639
Click?

322
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,080
Your head's so square, it's like a mahjong tile.

323
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,320
Where's the roundness?

324
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,960
I'm begging you,

325
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,240
when I'm talking to her,

326
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,480
please don't interrupt, okay?

327
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,240
She's calling again.

328
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,840
It's a video call.

329
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,799
That's my charm.

330
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,039
Shishi.

331
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,559
Shishi.

332
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,279
Dr. Zhang,

333
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,440
um,

334
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,480
this is my first time in therapy.

335
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,279
In movies,

336
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,720
people always lie down.

337
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,960
Why are you making me lie face down?

338
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,240
That's not the same.

339
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,279
Lying down is therapy.

340
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,679
Face down is my new invention.

341
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,519
It's called essential oil—

342
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,720
It's called, called, called—

343
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,840
Spiritual Massage.

344
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,720
So before it was just therapy?

345
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,559
Before, just massage.

346
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,720
Not as effective.

347
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,200
Relax.

348
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,159
My Spiritual Massage method

349
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,639
is based entirely on psychology.

350
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,399
Developed scientifically.

351
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,679
Totally professional.

352
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,279
Come.

353
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
Let's check your questionnaire.

354
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,120
One point.

355
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,519
Zero.

356
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,320
One.

357
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Final score:

358
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,480
Seventeen.

359
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,440
What's the total?

360
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,320
One hundred fifty.

361
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,559
Is it that bad?

362
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,559
Nurse Zhang,

363
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,399
admit the patient right away.

364
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,440
And bring a sedative.

365
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,519
Patient's condition is dire.

366
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,720
Violence could break out anytime.

367
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,080
Dr. Zhang,

368
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,720
I can hear you.

369
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,000
Don't mind.

370
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,039
Just in case.

371
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,399
Wait,

372
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,840
is my mental illness that bad?

373
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,240
I feel like my mood

374
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,440
is pretty stable.

375
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Your current stability

376
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,000
is all built on

377
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,960
repressing lots of negative emotions.

378
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,639
If you can't hold it in,

379
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,320
you'll totally break down.

380
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,039
Completely explode.

381
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,600
Even risk schizophrenia.

382
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,759
You must take medicine now.

383
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:56,799
Luckily,

384
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,679
I've got a special medicine.

385
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,960
One course

386
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,960
is fifty-eight hundred.

387
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,519
All-natural, high-tech drug.

388
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,960
Plant herbal essence.

389
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,120
I'll go get it for you.

390
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,919
You'll feel amazing after.

391
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,879
You'll wish you were sick just to take it.

392
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,519
One course costs five thousand eight hundred.

393
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,080
How much do I have to spend on this?

394
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,320
Masked Psychological Support Group

395
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,200
Isn't there a free program here?

396
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,440
Still trying to scam me out of money.

397
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,480
Come on, alpaca, have some food.

398
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,840
Once upon a time

399
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,440
Not eating?

400
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,879
Someone loved you for a long time.

401
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,759
And then

402
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,240
Later on

403
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,559
They stopped thinking of you.

404
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,960
Stop singing.

405
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,799
Even the alpaca isn't eating now.

406
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
You're way too into the role.

407
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,079
You're just reinforcing your tragic

408
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
persona, aren't you?

409
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,359
I just got back from the police station today.

410
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,400
I told you,

411
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,039
this was bound to happen sooner or later.

412
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,839
Shishi reported it, right?

413
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,319
I was the one who reported it.

414
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
I got scammed.

415
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,480
The police called me and said

416
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,640
Shishi was caught.

417
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,640
A guy over one meter eighty tall.

418
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,480
I said every time we video chatted,

419
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,440
he always used that lion filter.

420
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,160
Turns out he has a full beard.

421
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,359
How much did he scam you for?

422
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:43,920
Three thousand.

423
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,200
His accomplices already moved it overseas.

424
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
It can't be recovered anytime soon.

425
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,160
In the hallway

426
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,039
Anti-fraud ads are on TV every day.

427
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,359
Right in front of me,

428
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,119
is a living, breathing sucker.

429
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,519
Turtle, time to eat.

430
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,319
Turtle.

431
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,279
Turtle, time to eat.

432
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,559
Stop overthinking.

433
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,079
Go clean up the poop.

434
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,559
It's piling up over there.

435
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,680
Eat up.

436
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,519
You're not actually depressed, are you?

437
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,119
Don't take it too hard.

438
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,640
Love, you know,

439
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,640
is like a ghost.

440
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,079
Many believe in it,

441
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,079
few ever meet it.

442
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,480
It's not about love for me.

443
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,160
I'm just upset about the money.

444
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,640
That hurts.

445
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,160
I'm not good at comforting people.

446
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,400
It's just

447
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,400
as the saying goes,

448
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,799
men sing when they're troubled,

449
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,079
women cry when they're troubled.

450
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,359
Why not sing a bit more?

451
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,519
I promise I won't laugh at you.

452
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,599
Not singing anymore.

453
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,680
Oh no.

454
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,759
It's about to flip belly up.

455
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,799
I've sent you the photos.

456
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,240
Check them yourselves.

457
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,279
This crappy mask is way too small.

458
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,279
Sorry, sir.

459
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,400
Ours is made for

460
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,039
children aged two to three.

461
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,279
This size is just right.

462
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,319
But you didn't mention that.

463
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:42,759
Sorry about that.

464
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,960
How about we send you another one?

465
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,519
No time, I need it today.

466
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,039
Hello.

467
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,039
Your Bear Milk Tea

468
00:19:59,319 --> 00:19:59,799
was delivered to the wrong place.

469
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,359
It's for upstairs.

470
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,240
Sorry.

471
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,319
Sorry, I messed it up.

472
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,160
Wait a second.

473
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,319
Life is a journey like this,

474
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,680
how much suffering until it's complete?

475
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,400
No idea if I'll ever bounce back.

476
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,000
We're all

477
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:33,440
people who tough it out.

478
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,960
I'm late.

479
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,000
Come in, please come in.

480
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,559
Alright.

481
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,759
Remember to knock next time.

482
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,640
You startled me coming in like that.

483
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,440
Calm your breathing.

484
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,319
Let's continue sharing anonymously.

485
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,240
This friend just now

486
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,720
shared their relationship troubles.

487
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,160
Now let's hear

488
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,359
from our next friend.

489
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,359
They'll share

490
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,279
what life issues they're facing.

491
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,200
Why don't you go ahead?

492
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:13,880
It's my turn.

493
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,200
What's bothering me?

494
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,160
To be honest,

495
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,480
I also opened a counseling office.

496
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,720
We're in the same business.

497
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,920
But for me,

498
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,160
it's just being thrown into it.

499
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,599
I used to run a restaurant.

500
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,720
Did massages too.

501
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,359
But every business failed.

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,720
Now this one,

503
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,680
isn't counseling popular?

504
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,200
So I thought I'd try it.

505
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,200
This thing

506
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,119
isn't that hard.

507
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,039
It's just chatting.

508
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,759
But after a few sessions, I felt

509
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,839
this chat is not that chat.

510
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,359
The people I talked to

511
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,880
either wanted to jump in a river or hang themselves.

512
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,920
I thought, this can't go on.

513
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
So I came here to fix things before it's too late.

514
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,920
Learn some psychology.

515
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,720
Otherwise, every time I face my clients,

516
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,920
I feel a lot of pressure.

517
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,359
Feel like a fraud.

518
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,920
No need to feel that way.

519
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,440
We're just sharing stories.

520
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,599
No judgment on anything.

521
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,119
Dr. Zhang

522
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:05,720
Who wants to share?

523
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,319
Dr. Zhang

524
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:07,720
Me.

525
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,480
Meng Hang

526
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,319
Meng Hang

527
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:10,920
Why are you here?

528
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,160
I saw in your office

529
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,839
a poster for this place.

530
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,920
You organized this?

531
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,599
I came here on my own.

532
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,759
Why did you come?

533
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,079
Give me back my consultation fee.

534
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,400
You never paid me.

535
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,680
Me

536
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,400
Little Fish Head

537
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,599
Why don't you share something?

538
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,440
As for me,

539
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,359
there's someone—

540
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,000
a childhood friend I was really close to.

541
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,519
We had a great bond.

542
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,319
But what he doesn't know is,

543
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,559
when we were ten,

544
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,480
while he was in the outhouse,

545
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,720
I set off firecrackers in the latrine.

546
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
The one who ruined his appetite for life—

547
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,160
was me.

548
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,480
That scene back then—

549
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,480
just thinking about it...

550
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,599
Anyway, it's been years since it happened.

551
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,160
Every time I see him,

552
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,079
I still

553
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:55,960
feel uneasy inside.

554
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,960
Me...

555
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,519
Actually, I have a childhood sweetheart.

556
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,359
We spent our days together,

557
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,000
peeing and playing in the mud for almost twenty years.

558
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:04,880
And then,

559
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,160
we still mess around like that.

560
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,759
And, and then...

561
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,920
After we grew up,

562
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,559
I kind of started liking him.

563
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,480
But I, I...

564
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,519
I was too shy to say it.

565
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,519
So later on,

566
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,519
I became his male bestie.

567
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,200
My family pressured me back then.

568
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,920
So I picked someone from the blind dates

569
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,920
who seemed decent and got married.

570
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:26,000
But we have nothing in common.

571
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,680
It's been two years since we married.

572
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,039
Still feels like we're strangers.

573
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,559
Every night I wake up

574
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,720
and get startled.

575
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:32,920
I lie there thinking for ages—

576
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,920
who's this lying next to me?

577
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,240
Me

578
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,599
My mother-in-law has been staying
at our place lately.

579
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,240
She criticizes me every single day.

580
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,039
Sometimes I wonder if she's
an alien.

581
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,960
Didn't notice.

582
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,839
Humans with such low emotional
intelligence...

583
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,599
My family is even less reliable.

584
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,559
My dad

585
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,559
is lazy all day long.

586
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,039
Whenever my mother-in-law says
men are unreliable,

587
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,839
my dad

588
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,839
always shows up as a living example.

589
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,480
My wife is the same.

590
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:02,519
When her mom arrives,

591
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,279
she instantly backs down.

592
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,200
I thought she was tough.

593
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,519
I don't dare confront her.

594
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,480
Can't go against her.

595
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,400
You say one thing,

596
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,559
she's got a hundred replies
ready for you.

597
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,200
I keep thinking,

598
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,359
someone with such a sharp tongue

599
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,319
must have a wicked heart.

600
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,279
It's only because I'm wearing
a mask today

601
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,400
otherwise, this stuff

602
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,720
I wouldn't dare say.

603
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,759
I can tell

604
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,319
you've been through a lot.

605
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,720
This little zombie hasn't spoken
at all.

606
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,039
Why don't you share

607
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,720
the troubles you're facing?

608
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,559
I didn't have any problems
at first.

609
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,000
But after coming here,

610
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,559
I found a lot of issues.

611
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,440
How should I put this...

612
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,839
I just don't get it.

613
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:44,839
You

614
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,720
Psychological counseling is popular,

615
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,880
so you pretend to be a counselor.

616
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,799
The news says

617
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,039
the zoo is short on monkeys.

618
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,880
Why don't you pretend to be
a monkey?

619
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,640
If you have time to fake it,

620
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,240
why not think seriously

621
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,799
about what you could actually do?

622
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,039
You

623
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,720
A simple apology could've solved it,

624
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,519
but you held it in for years.

625
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
That crap

626
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,160
was cleaned up long ago.

627
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,440
But in your mind,

628
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,640
it stays forever.

629
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,880
And you,

630
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,880
pretending to be a male bestie?

631
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:14,960
When they get married,

632
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,039
you act as the bridesmaid.

633
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:16,960
When they have a kid,

634
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,039
you pretend to be the godmother.

635
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,400
When they're a hundred and in ICU,

636
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,440
you'll pretend to be a patient.

637
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,079
How long will you keep pretending?

638
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,160
If you like him,

639
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,960
just tell him.

640
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,440
You

641
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Your peers get married,

642
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,680
so you get married too?

643
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,559
If your peers die,

644
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,759
will you jump into the furnace too?

645
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:34,799
As a couple,

646
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,079
is there anything you can't

647
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:36,640
bring up

648
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,960
and talk openly about?

649
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,200
If you can stay together, do it.

650
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,480
If not, just divorce.

651
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,240
Why are you sharing here anyway?

652
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:45,519
And you,

653
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,400
your mother-in-law lives in the house
you and your dad own.

654
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,440
Why don't you dare speak up?

655
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,160
You're such a coward.

656
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:54,920
You might as well

657
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,480
put your mother-in-law's name

658
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,039
on the first page of your family register.

659
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,359
And you,

660
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,079
I don't even bother talking about you.

661
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,000
Online dating,

662
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,960
add a filter,

663
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,440
meant to scam others,

664
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,799
but got scammed instead.

665
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,640
Serves you right.

666
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,279
Don't get it.

667
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,079
Humans...

668
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,559
With a mask on, you dare say anything.

669
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,119
But usually,

670
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,559
it's like wearing a mask.

671
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,880
I suggest

672
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,279
we take off our masks.

673
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:23,759
That way,

674
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,440
we can be honest with each other.

675
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,400
Okay.

676
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,039
This friend made a great point.

677
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,559
Since that's the case,

678
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,279
let's all follow her lead.

679
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,039
Take off

680
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,680
the masks.

681
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,839
Let's be open with each other.

682
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,319
How about it?

683
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,759
Take it off.

684
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,920
It's off.

685
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,640
Take it off.

686
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:42,519
Take it off.

687
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,200
Why are they here?

688
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,880
If you're so free,

689
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,799
why not help me mop the pet shop?

690
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,519
You're so focused on a silly ad.

691
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,519
Mom

692
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,359
This ad is pretty interesting.

693
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:29,759
Look,

694
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,480
Psychological Support Group.

695
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,359
Do we have mental illnesses
on our planet?

696
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,519
Never heard of it.

697
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:36,519
We do.

698
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,119
But we cure them quickly.

699
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Old Man Meng

700
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,400
said he had depression.

701
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,200
He stopped working every day.

702
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,680
On our home planet,

703
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,799
he'd be cured in one day.

704
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,200
How do you treat it?

705
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,039
The head

706
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,079
is sawed open.

707
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,000
Take out the brain.

708
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,240
Wash it.

709
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,119
No blood streaks allowed.

710
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,799
Wash it clean.

711
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,920
Then sprinkle five mixed medicines.

712
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,240
Let it sit for a while.

713
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,079
Finally,

714
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,640
put it in

715
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,960
a high-temperature sterilizer.

716
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,440
Ding.

717
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,720
Put it back in.

718
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,880
Why is there something extra?

719
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,039
I'm cured.

720
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,759
Honestly, that sounds pretty good.

721
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,319
But that thing of yours—

722
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,519
What if it gets jammed?

723
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,519
No worries.

724
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,599
Just put it in the regeneration chamber.

725
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,920
Chop off the head.

726
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,599
Then—

727
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,400
Grow a new one.

728
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,079
That's way too violent.

729
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,839
It's lucrative.

730
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The fees are sky-high.

731
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,640
Mom.

732
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,480
How about—

733
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,920
We join this support group.

734
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,480
See how Earth people treat things.

735
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,119
We can bring Dad along.

736
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,359
He’s always so depressed.

737
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,119
That’s not good.

738
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,640
Sounds good.

739
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,920
If he gets cured—

740
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,039
He can work again.

741
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,480
Looks like this friend lacks courage.

742
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,119
Come on.

743
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,599
Let’s all encourage him.

744
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,039
Take it off.

745
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:18,400
Take it off, take it off, take it off!

746
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,559
Everyone—

747
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
See you next time.

748
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,079
I’ve got something to do, I’ll head out.

749
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,359
Meng Hang.

750
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,599
Meng Hang, Meng Hang, answer the phone!

751
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,720
Is that you?

752
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,559
What a coincidence, everyone’s here.

753
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,759
Yeah.

754
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,480
The mean one—

755
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:00,559
Is here too.

756
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,440
That’s rough.

757
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,359
Your whole family takes turns hitting you.

758
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,240
I should help you heal your trauma.

759
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,799
Just shut up.

760
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,599
Stop talking about your therapy.

761
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,400
Just use your skills—

762
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,400
Fix my bones, that’s enough.

763
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,319
Don’t worry, don’t worry.

764
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,240
Bone setting, sure.

765
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,200
I’m a pro at bone setting and massage.

766
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:37,799
Come on.

767
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,039
Move over there a bit.

768
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,799
Relax.

769
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,119
Lift your face.

770
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,119
Face, face, face.

771
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:46,200
Relax.

772
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:46,920
One.

773
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:47,680
Two.

774
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,200
Three.

775
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,400
How’s that?

776
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,599
Is it fixed?

777
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:57,319
Yeah.

778
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,039
It doesn’t hurt now.

779
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,000
But why do I feel—

780
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:02,960
My right side—

781
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,440
Is numb.

782
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,119
It’s fine.

783
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,319
Totally normal.

784
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,359
Totally normal.

785
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,920
Let me get ready.

786
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,039
I’ll do some acupuncture for you.

787
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,839
Acupuncture works wonders.

788
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,599
One poke—

789
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,559
You’ll feel it instantly.

790
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,960
Doctor.

791
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,920
Are you ready?

792
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,039
Doctor.

793
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,640
Are you ready?

794
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,880
Doctor.

795
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,799
Are you ready?

796
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,799
Doctor.

797
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,039
Give back what you took from me.

798
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,720
Come back, come back.

799
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,599
Give it back.

800
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,799
No more depression!

801
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,359
The support group actually helps.

802
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,119
It’s useless.

803
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,519
Money cures heartache.

804
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,400
My money—

805
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,680
Is about to be recovered.

806
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,559
The police contacted you.

807
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,839
They messaged me.

808
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,440
Asked me to send them the account.

809
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,960
I sent them the account and password.

810
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,680
Got three thousand back.

811
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,440
That’s great!

812
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,519
I knew you guys weren’t reliable.

813
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,759
Look at their efficiency.

814
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,799
Amazing.

815
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:37,839
Thank you, thank you.

816
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,160
Thank you, police.

817
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,599
With that IQ—

818
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,079
Who else would scammers target?

819
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,359
You even pretended to be police and paid him.

820
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,240
Totally unnecessary.

821
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,920
Don’t let him hear that.

822
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,000
I was worried his depression would get worse.

823
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
This is great.

824
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
Money solves everything.

825
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,079
I’m feeling a bit down.

826
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,680
Eat some oranges, you’ll feel better.

827
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,160
My illness isn’t expensive.

828
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,680
Two thousand is enough.

829
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,240
From my observation—

830
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,880
Humans, when communicating—

831
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,680
Always say one thing face-to-face—

832
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,480
And another behind your back.

833
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:24,720
They waste time—

834
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,839
Guessing each other’s true intentions.

835
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,799
It really lowers efficiency.

836
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:31,079
If Earth people were like us—

837
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,079
And spoke directly—

838
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:32,839
They’d definitely—

839
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Be much better off.

840
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:34,640
This—

841
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,759
Is a unique trait of our home planet.

842
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,200
I’ll keep observing closely—

843
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,359
The cultural differences between Earthlings and us.

844
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,559
This comparative study—

845
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,839
For both civilizations—

846
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,759
Is highly valuable.

847
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,359
Meng Hang.

848
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,680
I finally finished this lousy shift.

849
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,839
Let’s go see a movie tonight.

850
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,480
It’s just a dumb report.

851
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:59,599
Just bluff the boss.

852
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,839
Throw in some big words.

853
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,359
Alright.

854
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,160
See you tonight.
