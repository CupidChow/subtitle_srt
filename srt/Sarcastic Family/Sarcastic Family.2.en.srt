1
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,200
Mom

2
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,200
You're back.

3
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,079
Um...

4
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,640
My dad is here.

5
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
Isn't this that crazy guy?

6
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,759
Isn't this that fool?

7
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,080
I changed my look.

8
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,919
She can't recognize me.

9
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,719
She can't recognize me.

10
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,560
Are they falling for each other?

11
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,879
Did someone mess up my dad's brain?

12
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,599
Say something.

13
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,960
Say something.

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,800
Nice to meet you.

15
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,919
Please take care of me.

16
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,039
What are you doing?

17
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,759
Didn't we agree not to use powers?

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,240
I really can't hold it in.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
Seeing this old man makes me mad.

20
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,560
What's so hard for you to bear?

21
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,759
It's just the first meeting.

22
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,680
First meeting? Seriously?

23
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,759
The one who fought me outside just now.

24
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,520
That's him.

25
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,560
Changed his clothes.

26
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,039
Swapped shades for gold-rimmed glasses.

27
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,800
Looks even creepier now.

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,719
Can't win, just can't win.

29
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,240
New look, still can't beat him.

30
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,520
Let me tell you something.

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,639
Whether you can stay here

32
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,319
depends on their approval.

33
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,599
If they don't let me stay, I'll...

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,439
Don't threaten me with alien stuff.

35
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,599
What I say doesn't count.

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,840
If you expose me,

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,680
you'll have nowhere to stay.

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,599
Fine then.

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll cover for you.

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,039
You help me stay.

41
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,719
We'll see. Depends on you.

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,199
What about these two?

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,719
Hurry and untie them.

44
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,400
This is their place.

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,960
You need to get along with them.

46
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,400
Earthly social rules—

47
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,520
you haven't learned any.

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,120
I will.

49
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,199
Co-in-laws.

50
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,280
My mom is way too enthusiastic.

51
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,520
How about we eat first?

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,719
Dad, we want to discuss something.

53
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,639
Yes.

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,840
Mom came this time

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,879
planning to stay here

56
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,840
for a while.

57
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,959
You just mentioned

58
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,319
how much it costs to release an album.

59
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,360
One hundred thousand.

60
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,519
A buddy of mine, his eldest son

61
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,519
works at a record company.

62
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,160
It's a lot of money,

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,199
but

64
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,000
for our own album,

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,560
it's worth it.

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,279
Right?

67
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,120
But I heard

68
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,920
there's something called

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
fan crowdfunding now.

70
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,000
Seriously,

71
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,600
many bands release albums this way.

72
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,120
Fans? We don't have any.

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,199
Crowdfunding? We lack both.

74
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,120
Neither applies to us.

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
It's not that much, actually.

76
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,319
How about we old pals chip in?

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,759
Each puts in twenty-five thousand.

78
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,480
No, my money

79
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,160
is all tied up in investments.

80
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,120
My money

81
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,600
was all donated to hospitals.

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,319
I'm strapped for cash too.

83
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,839
But I live alone in a two-bedroom.

84
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,639
It's a bit of a waste.

85
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,360
I could rent it out first.

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Let it

87
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,720
be three months' rent, three months' deposit.

88
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,959
That could get us some.

89
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,040
Where would you live then?

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,000
Me?

91
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,079
I'll stay at my son's place.

92
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,920
He has three bedrooms.

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,519
Dad.

94
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,240
Dad.

95
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,519
When are you leaving?

96
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,759
Dad.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,519
Why can't you make small talk?

98
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,000
Dad.

99
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,680
If you don't agree,

100
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,000
my mom will leave right away.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,199
She won't say a word more.

102
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,439
Why should she?

103
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,480
You two are married.

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,759
This is your home now.

105
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,639
Technically,

106
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,519
it has nothing to do with the old man.

107
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,240
As parents,

108
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
don't meddle in your kids' marriage.

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
Give them their own space.

110
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,480
If that's the case,

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
it's even less your business.

112
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,639
Why are you living in my house?

113
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,279
You lived in my house when you were little.

114
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,800
I didn't mistreat you.

115
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,360
If you shrink, you can live here again.

116
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,879
Fair.

117
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,319
Nonsense.

118
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,560
Can I live my life again?

119
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
There's always the next life.

120
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,319
Let's

121
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
not reminisce for now.

122
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,759
Eat, eat.

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,079
Eat, try this dish.

124
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,079
This dish is good.

125
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,800
Eat up, hurry.

126
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,920
Is this your way of helping me?

127
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,839
Reverse psychology.

128
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,639
Who's the general here?

129
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,800
Don't just provoke me.

130
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,240
Stay calm.

131
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,959
Mom, are your eyes bothering you?

132
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,959
No, no, no.

133
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,480
Just now,

134
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,360
when I came,

135
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,360
I didn't mention it so you wouldn't worry.

136
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,839
When I arrived,

137
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
I bumped into the door frame.

138
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,079
Are you okay?

139
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,160
I'm fine now.

140
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
Not sure if there'll be any aftereffects.

141
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,759
I'll leave after dinner.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,720
Darn it.

143
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,040
Rent a small place in the suburbs.

144
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,240
Live alone, nice and quiet.

145
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,879
No one would notice if I stayed in for days.

146
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,639
You guys, every few days,

147
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,800
give me a call.

148
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,720
If I don't answer,

149
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,600
just call emergency services.

150
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
The nearest hospital

151
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,759
is a two-hour drive away.

152
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:57,879
Might as well

153
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,560
bring monks and priests along.

154
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,759
I want my send-off to be lively.

155
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,600
No, no, please—

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,600
Mom, what are you saying?

157
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,879
Now that you're home,

158
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,600
just stay here.

159
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,000
There's a spare room anyway.

160
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,759
Right, Lili?

161
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,800
Yes.

162
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,040
Is it suitable?

163
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,319
It's perfect.

164
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,639
If you live alone out there,

165
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,600
we'd be worried.

166
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,360
So,

167
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,319
is someone not okay with this?

168
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,680
I think

169
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,920
Lili and I

170
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,959
have no objections.

171
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,000
Got it.

172
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,399
I'm here to witness your family

173
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,800
happily reunited.

174
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,879
That's truly in the rock spirit.

175
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm leaving.

176
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,519
Come with me.

177
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,720
No need. Isn't your e-bike broken?

178
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,680
You can't give me a ride anyway.

179
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,439
Just go ahead.

180
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,800
The bikes will be gone soon.

181
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,399
Alright, alright.

182
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,639
I'll head out first, then.

183
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,720
Be careful on the road.

184
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,079
Mom.

185
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,279
Real estate elite.

186
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,439
Still biking to work?

187
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,160
It's a special case.

188
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,279
I don't usually bike.

189
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,120
It's all electric.

190
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,000
At his level,

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,720
he should ride bikes indoors.

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
In their social circle,

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,160
they sometimes bike to work.

194
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,399
It's about remembering the hard times.

195
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,360
Mom, I need to talk to you.

196
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,519
Since you've moved in,

197
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,440
there are things you should watch out for.

198
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,159
I get it.

199
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,759
I've been through it.

200
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,639
You two do your thing.

201
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,440
I go to bed early.

202
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,759
What do you mean?

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,879
I mean,

204
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,320
Meng Meng is starting to get suspicious.

205
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,600
Suspicious about what?

206
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,360
That we're not mother and daughter.

207
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,639
I said women need to take care of themselves.

208
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,919
We don't look like mother and daughter together.

209
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,960
So what do we look like? Sisters?

210
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,600
No.

211
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,039
Your face shape is different.

212
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,240
I take after my dad.

213
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,639
After all these years,

214
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,919
I've forgotten what your dad looks like.

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,120
It's been so many years.

216
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,159
If only I had a dad and no mom.

217
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,240
In this life,

218
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,080
it'd be great not to see either of you.

219
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't worry.

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,039
That'll happen soon.

221
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,759
Just hang in there two more days.

222
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,879
I'll send you off in style.

223
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,360
I'll add you to the family group chat.

224
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,840
To ease their doubts.

225
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,759
You—

226
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,679
In the group, you must

227
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,559
show lots of mother-daughter love.

228
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,679
Really act loving.

229
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,600
Your hands only know how to type.

230
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,919
Can't cook.

231
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,039
Mother-daughter love.

232
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,720
Alright.

233
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,840
Dear daughter,

234
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,120
Mom will buy you fish soon.

235
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,039
Humans are disgusting.

236
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,200
Lao Meng—

237
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,360
He eats and grabs everything.

238
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,120
You just have to stir up chaos.

239
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,639
Did you see that?

240
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,559
But yesterday,

241
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,600
I didn't hear anything.

242
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,840
He brought her to live at his place.

243
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,960
Yeah.

244
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,799
Seems like her.

245
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,360
No, no, no.

246
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,600
Looks pretty normal.

247
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,840
Yeah.

248
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,080
What are you saying about me?

249
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,919
No, no, not at all.

250
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,120
Just chatting.

251
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,120
Talking bad about me, right?

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,039
Of course not.

253
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,879
You're Lao Meng's co-in-law, right?

254
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,679
Yes.

255
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,879
I am.

256
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,919
Li Lili's mother.

257
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,879
We're a very loving mother-daughter pair.

258
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,879
Just like you ordinary Earth people.

259
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,120
Lao Meng never said that.

260
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,759
So what did he say about me?

261
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
He said you have some flaws.

262
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,720
Said you don't have a single friend.

263
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,879
Lao Meng said

264
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,960
he is

265
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,639
he's that—

266
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,399
What is it?

267
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,360
He said he's kind in word and deed.

268
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,279
You widows and orphans meeting him

269
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,799
that's

270
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,000
from a past life,

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,399
a blessing you earned.

272
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,399
Isn't it?

273
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,039
Yes, yes.

274
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,240
Getting worked up.

275
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:16,960
Uh-oh.

276
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,600
Nice tea.

277
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,360
Alright.

278
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,600
As for me,

279
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,759
I'm the head of the household.

280
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,799
My word has to count.

281
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,519
I took her in out of kindness.

282
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,840
She

283
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,720
is endlessly grateful.

284
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,440
Said she'd be my housekeeper.

285
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,200
Well,

286
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,559
How could I agree to that?

287
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,240
Right?

288
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,200
I said, "No need, no need."

289
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,080
I told her,

290
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,879
I said it's fine.

291
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,679
Just settle in and live here.

292
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,440
We'll all be family from now on.

293
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,679
So,

294
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,759
your son's place

295
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,600
is a bit crowded.

296
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,639
If that's not okay,

297
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,720
you can stay at my place.

298
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,639
Anyway, I

299
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,559
live alone.

300
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,159
You're so scheming.

301
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,559
Full of tricks.

302
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,320
This

303
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,279
Well, you two go ahead and talk.

304
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,799
You two chat first.

305
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,200
Uh, well...

306
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,360
I'll go stretch my legs outside.

307
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,799
I'll be outside, outside.

308
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,120
Up so early, huh?

309
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,559
If I get up any later,

310
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,679
the whole neighborhood will know I'm flawed.

311
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,360
You have no idea.

312
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,159
In the neighborhood,

313
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,639
those old men and women

314
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,519
just love to gossip.

315
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,600
It's too much.

316
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,039
They say you said it.

317
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,559
See, after making up stuff about you, now it's me.

318
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,159
Not a single honest word from them.

319
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,799
Seriously.

320
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,559
I think so too.

321
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,159
Let's go.

322
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,039
Let's go curse them out together.

323
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,279
No, no, no.

324
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,279
No need, no need, no need.

325
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,879
See, you don't know what to do now.

326
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,039
For this, you just

327
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,720
handle it coldly.

328
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:47,919
Never respond, no matter what.

329
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,200
Wait for the buzz to die down.

330
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,240
Everyone will forget.

331
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
If you go now,

332
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,279
it'll just stir up trouble.

333
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:53,879
Right?

334
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,720
Have some tea.

335
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,879
Is Meng Hang still comfortable living there?

336
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,320
When are you leaving?

337
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,480
Not sure.

338
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,519
I'll leave when my flight arrives.

339
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,519
Waiting for a plane, huh?

340
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,799
So you

341
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,080
just stay as long as you like.

342
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
Could be one or two days,

343
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,720
or maybe

344
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,399
one or two years.

345
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:17,559
You

346
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,440
taking a tractor?

347
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,200
Driving it all the way from Africa?

348
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,279
You just don't want to leave, do you?

349
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,200
What do you have here?

350
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,039
Everything.

351
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,080
Cat.

352
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:28,960
Dog.

353
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,639
Turtle.

354
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,200
Fish.

355
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,279
Alpaca.

356
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,679
This is the store's treasure.

357
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:34,960
Lili

358
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
said in the group chat

359
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,279
she wants to eat fish.

360
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,039
So you treat my place like a market.

361
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,000
You have to pay at the market.

362
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
This one's so fat.

363
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,879
None of these are for eating.

364
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:45,559
Can't eat them.

365
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,200
This

366
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,399
Normally, it's all mother-daughter bond.

367
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,720
But mention money for a fish,

368
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,200
and it gets vague.

369
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,120
So fake.

370
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
I'm fake?

371
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,320
But Lili and Meng Hang in the group

372
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,480
both said they want fish.

373
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,159
You just pretend not to see, right?

374
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,919
And make me do it, huh?

375
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,480
Well

376
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,960
I'll buy it, you cook.

377
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,720
Fine by me.

378
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,200
Go ahead, don't worry.

379
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,519
I'll watch the store for you.

380
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,159
Trying to trick me out of a fish, huh?

381
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,080
Just wait.

382
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,600
Liu Yingnian

383
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,120
Heard you're starting a new class?

384
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,279
I'll be there soon.

385
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay, okay.

386
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,720
So let's do this.

387
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,720
Let's

388
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,559
twenty minutes.

389
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,519
In twenty minutes,

390
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,559
let's meet at the neighborhood gate.

391
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,159
Alright.

392
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,159
Okay, okay.

393
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:37,840
Meng

394
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,679
Heading out?

395
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,559
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Park Avenue.

397
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,480
Going to see an apartment.

398
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,159
Didn't your e-bike break?

399
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:45,679
How are you getting there?

400
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,240
Shared bike.

401
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,919
How far is Park Avenue?

402
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,879
Shared what bike?

403
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,960
Take my bike.

404
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:51,759
That's not right.

405
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,840
Don't you have a client this afternoon?

406
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,480
It's hard to get a client.

407
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,000
You have to seize the chance.

408
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,200
Stop letting your boss yell at you.

409
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:00,840
I can't stand watching this.

410
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,840
Alright.

411
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,879
Thanks, Lao Cha.

412
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,440
Hurry up.

413
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,000
Be careful.

414
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,559
The teacher isn't here yet.

415
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,000
Here you are again.

416
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,399
Nice.

417
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,240
You're not late today.

418
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,360
Yeah, I knew you'd be here today.

419
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,679
Had to get here early.

420
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,240
You talk better than me.

421
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,279
Lao Meng

422
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,559
Didn't you say you weren't coming today?

423
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,159
I hired a temp for the store.

424
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,240
Such a big store,

425
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,600
left to a temp.

426
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,679
You're really okay with that?

427
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,440
It's just a pet supply shop.

428
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,600
Pay and get your stuff.

429
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,279
What trouble could she cause?

430
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,799
Hello.

431
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,480
Got a pretty auntie today.

432
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,279
I want to buy that British Shorthair.

433
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,320
How much is it?

434
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,039
No need to pay.

435
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,799
It's yours.

436
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,879
With the cage.

437
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,600
Thanks.

438
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,679
The lady boss is so nice.

439
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,399
You and the boss are a perfect match.

440
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,399
Just take it.

441
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,399
Are you crazy?

442
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,759
Boss

443
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,559
Can you check if my dog can be saved?

444
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,120
You're lucky you found this place.

445
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,279
Can you save it?

446
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,360
Why save it?

447
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,840
But

448
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,440
Dogs are on sale today.

449
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,000
You can just buy a new one.

450
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,679
Where's the person?

451
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,840
Your dad passed away this afternoon.

452
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,159
Mom, what's wrong with Dad?

453
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,080
Exactly.

454
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,759
He said he was going to buy fish
this afternoon.

455
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,559
He asked me to watch the shop for him.

456
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,240
But he still hasn't come back.

457
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,639
You scared me to death.

458
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,600
Then it's fine.

459
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,159
He didn't go to buy fish.

460
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,360
He went to slack off instead.

461
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,679
Probably went to the senior college
to have fun.

462
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,559
Just went to play.

463
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,600
Treats me like free labor.

464
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,759
Send me the address.

465
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,919
So,

466
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,600
this Andromeda Galaxy

467
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,159
is the closest galaxy
humans can observe

468
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,360
to the Milky Way.

469
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,639
It's the nearest galaxy.

470
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Its diameter

471
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,559
is over 220,000 light-years.

472
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,600
That's 1.6 times the Milky Way.

473
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,080
So by

474
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:02,879
calculating,

475
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,840
we can figure out

476
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,240
the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy.

477
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,240
Here's the formula, come on.

478
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Which student can tell me?

479
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,119
It's been three years.

480
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,920
A full three years.

481
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
No one has ever

482
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,480
raised their hand in my class.

483
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,839
No one has answered a single question.

484
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,200
Uncle Meng, you're the first.

485
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,720
Go ahead.

486
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,920
Teacher, I just want to confirm

487
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,559
what this class is about.

488
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,640
What are we learning?

489
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,599
No,

490
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,039
this is astronomy.

491
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,119
Isn't it obvious?

492
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,480
It's all circles and lines.

493
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,920
Is it cooking or something?

494
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,519
Teacher, I mean, I think

495
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,359
this knowledge,

496
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,000
you should, you...

497
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,240
You should step out of science

498
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
and into real life.

499
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,000
For example, Andromeda—

500
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,720
what's its rising sign?

501
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,559
Right?

502
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,839
How does this sign handle Mercury retrograde?

503
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,079
What's the personality of people
with this sign?

504
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,079
Most importantly,

505
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,119
if someone with this sign dates us,

506
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,119
which sign matches best with ours?

507
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,319
Your knowledge should cover

508
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,440
what regular folks care about.

509
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,079
Right?

510
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:11,680
Right.

511
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,319
For example, Andromeda—

512
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,440
is it a sun sign or a moon sign?

513
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,519
Never heard of it.

514
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,720
Does it even exist?

515
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,839
Of course it does.

516
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,440
If not, how would I be here?

517
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,440
You're definitely not from Andromeda.

518
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,440
You're from my pet shop.

519
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,240
Didn't I ask you to watch the shop?

520
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Why did you come here?

521
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,279
Didn't I tell you to buy fish?

522
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,440
Why are you here?

523
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,359
I'm in class.

524
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,319
This, this...

525
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,319
If you can't answer the teacher's question,

526
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,599
you can't leave class.

527
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,240
Given

528
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,640
Andromeda's spiral arm speed is

529
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,680
170 kilometers per second.

530
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,839
Now use the basic gravitational constant
to calculate.

531
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,559
Andromeda's total mass is

532
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,880
8.3542

533
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,880
times ten to the forty-first kilograms.

534
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,720
That is,

535
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,640
1.14 trillion times the Sun's mass.

536
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,799
Wait, you—

537
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
How could you—

538
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:16,680
How do you—

539
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,400
How did you figure that out?

540
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,319
It's easy, even a three-year-old could do it.

541
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,240
It's common sense.

542
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,279
Let's go.

543
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,160
Don't just stand there.

544
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:24,960
Go buy fish.

545
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,960
Are you confused too?

546
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,720
You're not even as good as
my shop's temp worker.

547
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,519
You're worse than them.

548
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,480
You really need to prepare your lessons.

549
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,119
You should—

550
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,200
You, you, you...

551
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,400
That lady just now

552
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,799
must be a retired professor
from Tsinghua astrophysics.

553
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,000
A retired professor.

554
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,400
My car was parked here just fine.

555
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Someone scratched it.

556
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,640
Who did it?

557
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,119
No one admits it.

558
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,599
What's most important for us agents?

559
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:06,799
Looks.

560
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,839
Thick skin.

561
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,079
Dare to lie.

562
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,559
Who said that?

563
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,839
Who, who said we lie?

564
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,640
What nonsense.

565
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,000
It's honesty.

566
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,960
Admit it now.

567
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,880
It's not a big deal.

568
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,440
If I find out myself,

569
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,519
then it'll be a big problem.

570
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,839
Everyone, just confess.

571
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,079
You can't avoid it.

572
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,640
Manager, this—

573
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,039
Start—

574
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,039
Didn't even notify us before the meeting.

575
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,680
Took a client to see a house.

576
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,960
Meng Hang.

577
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,160
You specially modified this for me, right?

578
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:38,759
No.

579
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,519
This isn't my car.

580
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,240
It's Lao Cha's.

581
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,519
I searched all day for the keys.

582
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,880
Turns out you took it.

583
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,200
Didn't you lend it to me?

584
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:47,440
Meng Hang.

585
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:48,839
I've said before,

586
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,160
we're all colleagues.

587
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,519
Use it whenever you want.

588
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,400
But—

589
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,720
How could you be so careless?

590
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,200
You scratched the boss's car.

591
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,079
It wasn't me.

592
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,519
We caught you red-handed.

593
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,319
Did the boss scratch his own car
to frame you?

594
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,960
Would he scratch his own car?

595
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:05,880
I...

596
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,799
What do you mean, "I"?

597
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,440
I can tell at a glance it was you.

598
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,400
The fortune teller said that I

599
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,400
would take the blame all my life

600
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,359
with nowhere to cry about it.

601
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:27,640
But

602
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
I don't agree.

603
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,359
I think we're all just here to work.

604
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,359
Is it worth risking your life

605
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,720
over a little car repair money?

606
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,839
Lao Cha

607
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,000
has worked with me the longest,

608
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,359
but has the worst character.

609
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,519
About this,

610
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,559
do you admit it or not?

611
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,599
Make your own choice.

612
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,839
Meng Ge

613
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
Meng Ge, I really know I was wrong.

614
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,920
Please give me a chance.

615
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,759
I'm begging you, really.

616
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,039
Talk to the manager for me.

617
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,880
Explain what really happened.

618
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,599
I was in a rush this morning.

619
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,079
I accidentally scratched it.

620
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,279
Scratched it.

621
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,000
How did you scratch it?

622
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,480
Show me how.

623
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Meng Ge

624
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,519
Like this.

625
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:16,920
Manager

626
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,000
Did you see clearly?

627
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:18,839
It was like this.

628
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,720
Didn't see it clearly.

629
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,480
Do it again.

630
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,640
Like this.

631
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
Did you see it this time?

632
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:25,319
I

633
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:25,960
still didn't see it clearly.

634
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,799
Scratch it again.

635
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:28,640
This

636
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,160
way

637
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,559
scratch

638
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,039
Again.

639
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:30,599
This

640
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,119
way

641
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:31,640
scratch

642
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,160
it.

643
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,200
Manager

644
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,519
Did you see clearly?

645
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,039
That's how I scratched it.

646
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,079
Still didn't see it.

647
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,319
Meng Ge, Meng Ge, Meng Ge

648
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,119
I saw it clearly.

649
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,480
I was wrong.

650
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,400
I was wrong.

651
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,519
You're responsible for fixing it.

652
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,559
Did you hear me?

653
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,160
Did you hear me or not?

654
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,519
Okay, manager.

655
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,079
It's to make Meng Hang think we have a mother-daughter bond.

656
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,960
It's not like we really have a mother-daughter bond.

657
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,079
Strengthen it again soon.

658
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,920
So Meng Hang gets a fixed impression.

659
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,359
Easy, just wait.

660
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,079
Whenever you ask, I always have time.

661
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:00,839
602

662
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:02,319
Well,

663
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,680
I'll wait for you there.

664
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,480
Later is fine.

665
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:11,640
It's cooler later.

666
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,559
Anytime works for me.

667
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,000
Alright, bro.

668
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,960
See you tomorrow.

669
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,079
What are you doing?

670
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,200
Client.

671
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,359
Looking at a house.

672
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,680
Client.

673
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,519
You've been chatting since you got off work

674
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,880
all the way till midnight.

675
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,519
What house are you looking at?

676
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,720
Your heart.

677
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,200
Darn it.

678
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,119
Lao Cha

679
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,559
Today I took the blame for Lao Cha.

680
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,640
To thank me,

681
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Lao Cha gave me a client.

682
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,039
Who knew this lady would be so tough?

683
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,720
She kept asking me questions nonstop.

684
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,519
And I can't offend a client.

685
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,920
If something was really up,

686
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,000
would I text right in front of you?

687
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,799
Check for yourself.

688
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,079
What do you mean?

689
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,720
I'm not looking.

690
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,720
No trust at all.

691
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,920
Why even get married then?

692
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:06,920
That's fine then.

693
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,880
Next time, don't slam my laptop so hard.

694
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,599
That cost over eight hundred.

695
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm going to the bathroom.

696
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,519
Stop.

697
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,039
Mom.

698
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,119
What are you doing?

699
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,200
Hand it over.

700
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,079
What?

701
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,039
Your phone.

702
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,839
I heard everything.

703
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,240
Lili is too shy to look.

704
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,319
But I'm not.

705
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,319
No, Mom,

706
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,119
this has nothing to do with you.

707
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,720
How does it not concern me?

708
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,240
We're a pair,

709
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,319
a mother and daughter with a deep bond.

710
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,599
It's my duty

711
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,440
to protect my daughter from harm.

712
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,480
If I

713
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,440
hesitate, it means I'm guilty.

714
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,440
Password.

715
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:58,880
Lili's birthday.

716
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,640
Which day?

717
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,880
June thirtieth.

718
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,839
You don't remember that?

719
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,440
Don't change the subject.

720
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,880
Let me check the chat history.

721
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,559
Hang Hang,

722
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,440
have you had dinner?

723
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,400
Don't wear yourself out.

724
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,640
Who's this woman?

725
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,000
My mom.

726
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,160
You have a mom?

727
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
Didn't your mom divorce your dad ages ago?

728
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,720
Why?

729
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,799
She hates my dad.

730
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,039
Your mom's taste is alright.

731
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,640
But I've never replied to her.

732
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,039
Just like Lili.

733
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,359
If you're not family,

734
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,920
you don't enter the same house.

735
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,319
I checked everything, nothing's wrong.

736
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,079
Go to bed early.

737
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,599
Last time, the assign—

738
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,400
—the assignment we got

739
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,519
was about our

740
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,839
album's concept theme.

741
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,880
Has everyone thought about it?

742
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
Let's share our ideas.

743
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,279
I have an idea.

744
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,519
Let's use what's most important

745
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,559
to people our age as the theme.

746
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,200
Freedom.

747
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,400
Love.

748
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,920
No, that's not it.

749
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:16,799
It's insu—

750
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,319
—lin.

751
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,000
Insulin.

752
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,440
We can't live without it.

753
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,400
It's a great invention.

754
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,000
I want to praise it.

755
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,599
Next, next.

756
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,920
I think it should show

757
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,880
the spirit of rock.

758
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,160
Rebellion.

759
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,359
Wildness.

760
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,039
My theme is

761
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,039
Party till 8:30 p.m.

762
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,559
I think,

763
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,519
after our comeback,

764
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,000
our first album

765
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,640
can't be too small.

766
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
It has to be big.

767
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,440
My theme is

768
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,640
Jiuxianqiao.

769
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,720
Lao Shang, that's not very big.

770
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,200
None of these work.

771
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,319
Then you suggest one.

772
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,279
I agree.

773
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,039
We need to

774
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:56,680
go big.

775
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,279
We should head for the distance.

776
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,039
Wander.

777
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,640
No, even bigger.

778
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:03,920
Earth.

779
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,160
Didn't you say

780
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,079
we'd do original work

781
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,000
and not buy copyrights?

782
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,720
Even bigger.

783
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,799
Bigger than Earth.

784
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,400
That would be

785
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,640
the Sun.

786
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,279
I thought of one today—

787
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,039
Andromeda Galaxy.

788
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,480
Andromeda Galaxy.

789
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,119
That's a great theme for us.

790
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,519
What's that supposed to be?

791
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,880
I have class next week.

792
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,640
Once I learn it, I'll teach you.

793
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:28,759
This—

794
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,400
—this—

795
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,799
Alright, alright.

796
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:31,839
Lao Meng.

797
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:32,960
So,

798
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,920
how's your part of the funding?

799
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,480
No problem.

800
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,759
I've already rented out my place.

801
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,640
So you're staying at your son's?

802
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,279
I was supposed to stay there.

803
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,519
But my son's mother-in-law

804
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,079
moved in first.

805
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,640
I don't get along with her.

806
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,839
So where are you staying?

807
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,160
Yeah,

808
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,039
where are you living?

809
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,480
Come on, everyone, let's work harder.

810
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,839
Hurry up and move.

811
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,079
Come on, everyone, let's work harder.

812
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,000
Careful.

813
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:03,799
Don't bump into anything.

814
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:04,480
Slow down, slow down.

815
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,319
Alright.

816
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,119
Careful, careful, careful.

817
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:08,519
Slow down.

818
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,039
These things

819
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,119
are all my treasures.

820
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,640
Handle them gently.

821
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,519
Take your time, no rush.

822
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,720
What's up, Dad?

823
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,200
This, this—

824
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,039
Alright.

825
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:17,400
Dad.

826
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,079
This—

827
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:19,960
—this—

828
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,640
No—

829
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,920
What does this mean?

830
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,920
No—

831
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,519
As for me,

832
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,880
living in a two-bedroom is wasteful.

833
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
I can stay at the pet shop.

834
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,519
So I thought I'd rent it out.

835
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,079
Make some money.

836
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,200
That's called financial planning.

837
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,039
I'll leave my stuff at your place for now.

838
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,039
No—

839
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,319
You can't do that.

840
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,799
You didn't even ask me about renting.

841
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,880
Why would I ask you?

842
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,000
Well,

843
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,039
Meng Meng's a real estate tycoon.

844
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,880
He has lots of agencies.

845
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,400
Just eat, don't worry about it.

846
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,039
Actually,

847
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,440
I just wanted to be quick.

848
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,519
Rent it out fast.

849
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,240
I heard the agency next door

850
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,599
is pretty good, I—

851
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,680
You guys go.

852
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,559
No, Meng Hang—

853
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,400
So,

854
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,440
Dad just didn't want

855
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,160
to disturb your work.

856
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Didn't want to trouble you.

857
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,599
Right?

858
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,279
Right, Dad?

859
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,200
Dad.

860
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,519
Why don't you move in

861
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,519
and live with us?

862
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,680
I wouldn't dare.

863
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,440
Live with the kids?

864
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:11,319
No—

865
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm really afraid of bothering you.

866
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,519
It's not right, not right.

867
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,319
Then the pet shop—

868
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,839
If he wants to stay, let him.

869
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,799
It's pretty spacious.

870
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,440
You dare mention the pet shop?

871
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,799
Let you watch the pet shop,

872
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,599
just two hours,

873
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,000
six orders, five bad reviews.

874
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,559
Wasn't there one without a bad review?

875
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,960
An old lady came and scolded me herself.

876
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,039
Bad fame is still fame.

877
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,599
You should be thanking me.

878
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,480
Lili

879
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:39,359
Lili

880
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,680
Hurry up, I can't hold it anymore.

881
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,359
What's wrong?

882
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,599
You're not in there, are you?

883
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,319
Isn't it obvious?

884
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,319
Then Mom must be inside.

885
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,200
Go hurry her up for me.

886
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,079
I really can't hold it.

887
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:50,640
Quick, quick!

888
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:51,759
Mom

889
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,440
Mom

890
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,440
What's up?

891
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,960
You're not in there, are you?

892
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,279
Isn't it obvious?

893
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,759
Then who's inside?

894
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,480
Dad

895
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,200
Waiting in line.

896
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,039
No.

897
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,960
Aren't you living at the pet shop?

898
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,160
Yeah, but the pet shop isn't convenient.

899
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Just borrowing your bathroom.

900
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Hurry, hurry!

901
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,559
I left my toothbrush in there.

902
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,880
I just come by each morning to brush.

903
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,119
Okay.

904
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,559
This...

905
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,480
Can't eat this.

906
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,759
Don't worry.

907
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,519
I

908
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,880
I absolutely won't bother you.

909
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,359
Did he wash his hands?

910
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,640
Good thing Mom's out at noon today.

911
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,480
We finally get to enjoy this sunny lunch.

912
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,799
Here.

913
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,319
Sorry, sorry.

914
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,319
Uh...

915
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,119
Mind if I use your kitchen?

916
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,519
Well...

917
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,680
Can't help it.

918
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,000
No gas at the pet shop.

919
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,279
Borrowing your kitchen.

920
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,079
Just making some instant noodles.

921
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,640
Dad

922
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,759
Come eat with us.

923
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,640
No, no, no.

924
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,240
I said I wouldn't bother you.

925
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,400
Definitely can't bother you.

926
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,920
No.

927
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,799
It's fine, it's fine.

928
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,319
Hang Hang,

929
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,319
when you were little,

930
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,759
you'd eat instant noodles,

931
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,480
and leave half a bowl of soup.

932
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,680
That was enough for me.

933
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,480
Now,

934
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,799
things are better.

935
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,000
I get a whole bowl of noodles.

936
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,119
So happy.

937
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,359
A man in his sixties

938
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,359
kicked out by his unfilial son,

939
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,240
forced to live with cats and dogs,

940
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,200
abused by his daughter-in-law,

941
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,160
survives on instant noodles.

942
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,319
Talking about me?

943
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,799
What's with this guy?

944
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,599
Old father struggling alone outside,

945
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,960
while son and daughter-in-law enjoy life at home.

946
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:18,880
Meng Hang

947
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,240
Maybe let your dad

948
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
just stay here.

949
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,480
But like this now,

950
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,799
it's even harder.

951
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,920
I'll talk to him later.

952
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,079
It's just...

953
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,880
He comes and goes as he pleases.

954
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,640
No sense of boundaries at all.

955
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,359
Mom

956
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,359
You're eavesdropping again.

957
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,519
We should change the lock.

958
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,920
No privacy at all.

959
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,319
Lao Meng doesn't live here.

960
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,559
He doesn't live here,

961
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,400
but half the stuff here is his.

962
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,599
Especially all this toilet paper.

963
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,640
Why stockpile so much?

964
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,279
Is he running a public restroom?

965
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,519
I stocked that.

966
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,680
Mom really cares about us.

967
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,559
She's just worried we'll run out.

968
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,000
It's not for you.

969
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Then keep it in your own room, okay?

970
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:11,960
Meng Hang

971
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,239
I've always heard people say

972
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,960
living with parents after marriage

973
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,159
causes conflicts.

974
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,159
So I thought,

975
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,239
let your dad move in too.

976
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,960
I'll study this relationship in depth.

977
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,239
Better not.

978
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,320
It's fine.

979
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,320
He

980
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,559
is used to living alone.

981
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,079
He likes hanging out

982
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,360
with his rock band buddies.

983
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,119
Just spending time together.

984
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,159
See?

985
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,280
This...

986
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,519
This is all them.

987
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,679
Those old buddies.

988
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,039
Your dad seems pretty young.

989
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:40,519
Yeah.

990
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,800
If I die,

991
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,719
the bank card password is

992
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,000
three four five six seven eight.

993
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,599
What's this?

994
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,079
A will.

995
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,760
Doesn't he live alone?

996
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,239
Maybe he's worried

997
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,519
one day

998
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,639
Your dad seems carefree,

999
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,199
but he's actually thoughtful.

1000
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,480
He rented the place for me this time.

1001
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,239
So he can leave me more money.

1002
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,639
And then

1003
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,480
he knows

1004
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,519
my job isn't great.

1005
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,880
He wants me to have it easier.

1006
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,440
Maybe that's just how parents are.

1007
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,679
Mom

1008
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:36,960
Yeah.

1009
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,000
Yes, yes.

1010
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:42,079
I could write that too.

1011
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,039
But I really don't have any money.

1012
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:56,719
No need, no need.

1013
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,239
Dad.

1014
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,039
I...

1015
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:58,519
Dad.

1016
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,840
Just listen to me, please.

1017
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,159
No, that's not it.

1018
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:00,880
I live

1019
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,639
in the pet shop.

1020
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,119
It's pretty good.

1021
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm used to it now, really.

1022
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,280
Just listen to me this once.

1023
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,840
You're not young anymore.

1024
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,039
Stay close to us.

1025
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,840
We'll feel more at ease.

1026
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,079
We can look out for each other.

1027
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,920
Honestly, I just

1028
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,719
don't want to trouble you.

1029
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,400
Dad.

1030
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,000
We're all family.

1031
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,039
Two families.

1032
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,400
Don't mind her.

1033
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,599
We're family.

1034
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,440
There's no trouble at all.

1035
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,280
Alright, alright.

1036
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,639
I'll listen to you kids.

1037
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:23,840
Okay.

1038
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,239
Alright.

1039
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,320
I'll go tidy up for you.

1040
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:26,519
This...

1041
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,920
Yes, yes, yes.

1042
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,440
This...

1043
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,480
I appreciate your kindness.

1044
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
I understand.

1045
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,760
Here, take this.

1046
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,480
You're still in good shape.

1047
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,880
Don't overthink it.

1048
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,840
No, that's not it.

1049
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,400
Where did you find this?

1050
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,000
It's right here in the album.

1051
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,840
It made me feel a bit sad.

1052
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,320
I wasn't sad at all when I wrote it.

1053
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,800
I was really happy, you know?

1054
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,599
I wrote this song for the boss's birthday.

1055
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:55,800
Later, on his birthday,

1056
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,639
when we performed it,

1057
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,440
halfway through,

1058
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,800
the boss kicked us off stage.

1059
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,159
Lyrics.

1060
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,199
That's right.

1061
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,639
If I die,

1062
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,320
the bank card password is

1063
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,039
three four five six seven eight.

1064
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,840
This...

1065
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,039
This song is pretty good.

1066
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:18,880
My new album—

1067
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,559
I have to include it, definitely.

1068
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,840
You're releasing an album?

1069
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:22,760
Yeah.

1070
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,519
I rented out my house

1071
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:26,440
just to fund my new album.

1072
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:27,880
Well, well, well...

1073
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,000
This is really nice.

1074
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:30,880
Good, good, good.

1075
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
This song, I

1076
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,920
must use it, for sure.

1077
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,519
This...

1078
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,280
From now on, in the mornings,

1079
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,760
from five to seven,

1080
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,800
I'll be doing vocal practice.

1081
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:38,800
So...

1082
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,880
don't disturb me, okay?

1083
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,800
With your voice,

1084
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,039
when you sing, we have to practice escaping.

1085
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,880
Practice, practice, practice.

1086
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,719
No, the main thing is,

1087
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,239
my new lead single

1088
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,880
is a bit challenging.

1089
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,960
I need to get back in shape.

1090
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,199
A new song, Dad!

1091
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:51,920
Yes, yes, yes.

1092
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,320
What's the new song called?

1093
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:55,800
Someone

1094
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,440
from the Andromeda Galaxy.

1095
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,000
Earthlings are so fake.

1096
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,239
That Lao Meng—

1097
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,519
I could tell right away he wants to move in.

1098
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,760
He just won't admit it.

1099
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,199
As for Meng Hang,

1100
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,519
he says he welcomes me,

1101
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,920
but when he sees me, he turns and goes inside.

1102
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,519
And Lili—

1103
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,199
she's only been on Earth two years,

1104
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,639
and already cares about appearances.

1105
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,760
She wants me to act out the mother-daughter bond.

1106
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,039
A house full of actors.

1107
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,039
And they think they're all so great.

1108
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,480
I found one truly genuine person.

1109
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,480
Old Gao.

1110
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,519
He keeps asking me to stay at his place.

1111
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,840
I've already called the police.

1112
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,760
It's not that you shouldn't be real.

1113
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,519
It's just that he disgusts me.

1114
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,559
Me, I'm the type

1115
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,840
who always says what's on my mind.

1116
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,199
Not like Earthlings—

1117
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,639
always mentally exhausted.

1118
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,840
I believe

1119
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,239
instead of torturing yourself with mental exhaustion,

1120
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,880
it's better

1121
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,320
to go crazy and let it out.

1122
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,679
Make others suffer instead.

1123
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:28,719
No.

1124
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:29,800
Take you, for example.

1125
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,400
You should really give your boss a hard time.

1126
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Your editor-in-chief.

1127
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,880
Right?

1128
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Look at him.

1129
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:34,840
Mom.

1130
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,119
I still have to get his approval, Mom.

1131
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:37,880
Doesn't matter.

1132
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,440
That editor-in-chief of yours—

1133
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,159
if you ask me,

1134
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,480
he's a total fool.

1135
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,119
I'm telling you,

1136
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,840
you don't need to bother with him.

1137
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,280
You know?

1138
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,840
Let me tell you—

1139
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,920
when you see him, just

1140
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,880
bam, bam, bam!

1141
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,039
And then,

1142
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,159
just pinch him.

1143
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,159
See?

1144
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,840
Look, you're still working for him.

1145
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,679
Look at me—

1146
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,159
I've died eight times for him.
