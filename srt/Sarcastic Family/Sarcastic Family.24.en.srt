1
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,560
There is only one truth

2
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,479
Based on my analysis

3
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,400
The person must have just left

4
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,400
How can you tell

5
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,360
The water in this cup

6
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,360
Is still hot

7
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,199
Is there a possibility

8
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,560
That this cup is called a

9
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,800
Thermos cup

10
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,800
The makeup looks so gorgeous

11
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,280
Let me see

12
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,800
Are these my own eyelashes

13
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,319
As expected, they are not

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,520
A professional makeup artist really is different

15
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,439
Your face upgrade is like getting a new head

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
Stop following me

17
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,439
I need to change my wedding dress

18
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,439
I know

19
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,080
No

20
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,000
Go out

21
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,680
Go

22
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Let me record this

23
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,840
Fine, I will not film either

24
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,719
Sis, I am resting here a bit, I am tired

25
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:23,960
Get out

26
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,240
No, I just

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,159
Cai Yi, I

28
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,280
Let us both take a break

29
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,719
Why are you resting in the bride’s room

30
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,520
I am exhausted

31
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,840
Say no more

32
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,840
I do not want to upset myself

33
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,919
At least you know yourself

34
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,879
You really are my own daughter

35
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,000
So

36
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,000
Ugly, right

37
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:07,960
Really

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,199
Let me see

39
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,480
Are you stupid or what

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
You fall for it every time

41
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,240
With my high IQ genes

42
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,920
How did none of it pass to you

43
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,319
You take after your dad in everything

44
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,920
Mom

45
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,480
My dad

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,279
My dad did not come to my wedding

47
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,480
I am actually quite regretful

48
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,319
You really do not miss him

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,360
I do not

50
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,199
You look exactly like your dad

51
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,800
Why would I miss him

52
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
Having you is enough

53
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,759
You can go

54
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,519
Okay

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,879
Got it

56
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,839
Are you all right

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,600
I am fine

58
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,319
Yes

59
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,240
Well

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,439
Li Cai

61
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,839
He said

62
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,519
He left this here

63
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,800
And asked me to bring it to him

64
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,399
Bottoms up

65
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,800
Here

66
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,959
Shall we down it

67
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,720
Down it

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,279
Done

69
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:51,920
Downed it

70
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,480
Down it down it

71
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,000
You drink first

72
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,160
I cannot finish it

73
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,439
It is fine if you cannot

74
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,639
Drink it slowly

75
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
Okay, let us toast together

76
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,160
So nice, Jin Shu

77
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,000
It is okay, it is okay

78
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,720
Such a good temper

79
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,879
Now let us rehearse the speeches

80
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,720
Please welcome the bride’s mother onstage

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,680
Come on

82
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,399
I

83
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,519
Well...

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,199
My mom's speech draft

85
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,000
is not finished yet

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,360
right?

87
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,639
Let us just run through the process today

88
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,639
and deal with it tomorrow

89
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,959
Then rehearsal is over

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,720
Okay

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,439
Turn it off

92
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:36,879
Sis

93
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,959
Tonight you and Cai Yi go home

94
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,120
and everyone else goes back to the hotel

95
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,639
Tomorrow morning my brother in law comes to fetch the bride

96
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
You just wait at home for us

97
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,319
Okay

98
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,759
Okay

99
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
The arrangements are pretty clear

100
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,600
Okay

101
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,800
Drink a bit less

102
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,279
You have to get up early tomorrow

103
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,199
All right then

104
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,079
We will head back first

105
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,079
Rest early Mom

106
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,800
We are going

107
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,560
Go on

108
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:53,959
Wait for me

109
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,319
Well...

110
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,360
Y you go back first

111
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,639
What is wrong with you

112
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,720
I

113
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,560
I will discuss it a bit more with Li Cai

114
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,680
about my speech for tomorrow

115
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,120
You are discussing it with him

116
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,079
He is already drinking

117
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,519
What can you two even come up with

118
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,560
Li Li

119
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,360
If

120
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,680
I mean if just in case

121
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
at tomorrow's wedding

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,759
an important guest does not come

123
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,519
will it matter a lot

124
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,439
A guest

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
It should be fine

126
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,720
As long as bride and groom are there

127
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,439
Then I am relieved

128
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,560
Who who is not coming

129
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,839
This is for you

130
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,120
Well...

131
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,279
After the wedding

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,000
open it

133
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,920
What is this all mysterious for

134
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,319
Come on come on let us go home

135
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,839
Then I am going

136
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,439
Go on go on go on

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,560
Do not stay up too late

138
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,199
Li Li

139
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,040
If

140
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,439
I mean if just in case

141
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,759
an important guest does not come to the wedding tomorrow

142
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,320
will it matter a lot

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,840
Happy birthday to you

144
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
Happy birthday to you

145
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,320
Happy birthday to you

146
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,720
I hope my daughter

147
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,639
is as happy every day as she is today

148
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,279
Ever since I was little

149
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,360
I have looked forward most to this moment

150
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,919
Who allowed you to hold mine

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,720
You even slept in my bed

152
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,519
I even took photos

153
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,559
I will send them to you now

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,960
So gross

155
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,559
How do I delete this thing anyway

156
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,240
Why do you have to move it earlier

157
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,960
Plans cannot keep up with changes

158
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,759
The interstellar weather report says

159
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:19,879
Neptune

160
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,120
there is in the Kuiper Belt

161
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,639
a meteor shower

162
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,159
which will affect the flight safety of the route

163
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,720
so it was moved earlier

164
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:26,759
Then

165
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,600
then I will change to the next flight

166
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,360
You would have to wait for the next flight

167
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,799
five years and six months

168
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,919
and only hanging tickets are left

169
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,600
Hanging ticket

170
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,919
I would be outside the cabin

171
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,679
hanging there

172
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,559
crossing half the galaxy

173
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,559
Are you kidding me

174
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:44,720
Mom

175
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,399
Are you leaving tomorrow night?

176
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,759
No.

177
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,919
Stop lying to me.

178
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,360
I saw it all.

179
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,480
No.

180
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,039
I really, really am not.

181
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,879
Yes.

182
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,639
Tomorrow morning.

183
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,440
Tomorrow morning.

184
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,679
The flight was moved earlier.

185
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,679
I have to board at dawn.

186
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,679
Li Li,

187
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
come with me.

188
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,799
I heard some news.

189
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,279
If aliens stay on Earth too long,

190
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,320
they will die.

191
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,639
No kidding, you stay anywhere long enough, you die.

192
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,240
I am not finished yet.

193
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,799
Let me finish.

194
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,440
They said 3 years ago,

195
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,799
one of our folks

196
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,159
mysteriously went into

197
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,759
a rapid aging phase

198
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,279
and then died of

199
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,919
multi-organ failure.

200
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,279
No one cared at the time,

201
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,639
not until last month,

202
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,080
when the causes of death of more aliens

203
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,320
were exposed.

204
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,159
They found out

205
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,639
almost all were like this.

206
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,759
Only then did everyone know the truth.

207
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,320
We aliens come to Earth

208
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,960
and in the end

209
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,559
we all end up like that.

210
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:03,200
Yes.

211
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,639
We die miserably.

212
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,360
Bleeding from every orifice.

213
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,440
Then the heart suddenly stops.

214
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,399
Why are you telling me this?

215
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,480
Tell her.

216
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,240
And then just,

217
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:13,960
bang,

218
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,279
they explode.

219
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,399
They explode.

220
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,080
You have been on Earth for decades.

221
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,159
You have not exploded.

222
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,360
You are just in a rush to leave, right?

223
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,000
Then make up a better excuse.

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
This is way too perfunctory.

225
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,159
E even if what I said was just hearsay,

226
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,679
then what I am

227
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,120
about to say now

228
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,240
is absolutely true.

229
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,720
They are going to build

230
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,879
an Interstellar Highway.

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,960
Earth is in the way.

232
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,559
It is about to be hit with dimensional reduction.

233
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,679
Come with me.

234
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,399
Mom,

235
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,879
do you really not want to attend my wedding?

236
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,960
Y your mom is worried about you.

237
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,399
She is afraid you will be alone on Earth.

238
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,159
You shut up.

239
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,000
Far from home.

240
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,080
The wedding dress is still here.

241
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,039
Brother-in-law,

242
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,120
the button was left behind.

243
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,639
Left behind.

244
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,360
This implies

245
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,840
my sister was detained.

246
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,240
So this is a kidnapping case.

247
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,039
Stop messing around.

248
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,159
There is another possibility.

249
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,720
The button

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,919
popped off onto the floor.

251
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,159
That means when my sister tried on the dress,

252
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,000
she found she had gained weight.

253
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,279
So my sister went to lose weight.

254
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Right.

255
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
She got fat.

256
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,919
She even threw up a few days ago.

257
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:22,879
Most importantly,

258
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,360
her phone wallpaper

259
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,559
was changed to Guanyin.

260
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,080
What does that mean?

261
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,120
It means she wants to drink tieguanyin tea.

262
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,000
Shut up.

263
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,519
Guanyin granting a child.

264
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,919
She is pregnant.

265
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:45,919
Sis

266
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,799
You are pregnant

267
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,879
I am going to be an uncle

268
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,879
Who is pregnant

269
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,039
Am I really that fat now

270
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,679
Li Li

271
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,879
Where did you go

272
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,960
I, I

273
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,279
I went for a walk

274
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,639
Just out for a walk

275
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,639
I told you to lose some weight

276
00:14:59,039 --> 00:14:59,960
Hurry up, brother in law

277
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,720
Right, right, there is no time

278
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,240
Let us go

279
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,799
I have not changed into my gown

280
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,480
I have not put on my wedding dress

281
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,120
There is no time

282
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,120
My friends

283
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,399
The most thrilling moment is here

284
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,440
Please raise your golden palms

285
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,159
Silver palms

286
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,600
Money making palms

287
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,720
And warmly welcome

288
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,720
The groom and the bride

289
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:20,759
As they make a shining

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,600
Entrance

291
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,399
Honored guests, have you noticed

292
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,360
The groom

293
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,320
The way he looks at the bride

294
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,679
His eyes are glowing

295
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,600
Do you know why

296
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,679
Because the bride

297
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,879
Is now wrapped

298
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,200
In a beautiful kasaya

299
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,080
Wedding dress

300
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
I am a black bear demon now

301
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,799
This loving couple

302
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,320
With two hearts that

303
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,360
Are in love with each other

304
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,440
Are about to

305
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,919
Step onto this wedding

306
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,840
Of souls

307
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:05,759
Colliding

308
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,519
Hall

309
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,720
Groom, please

310
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,720
Collide with

311
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:09,600
The bride

312
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,879
Will the newlyweds enter the hall

313
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,639
Come on stage

314
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,919
Who let him host this

315
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,840
I regret it now too

316
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,399
Today

317
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,080
At this

318
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,000
Unforgettable moment of your lives

319
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,120
Everyone who loves you

320
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Holds in their hearts a

321
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,759
Shared wish

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,720
We wish you

323
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,559
In your happy love nest

324
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,880
To love each other wholeheartedly

325
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,920
On the journey of life

326
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,960
To walk hand in hand

327
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,319
Those two lines were not bad

328
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,279
You two

329
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,000
Sail on the great ship of love

330
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,880
Just like the Titanic

331
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
Riding the winds and waves

332
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,200
Can you wish us something better

333
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,680
As the saying goes

334
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,200
When you drink water, remember the well

335
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,359
As the saying goes

336
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,599
When you drink water, remember who dug the well

337
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,880
In happiness, do not forget

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,799
The kindness of your parents

339
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,920
So next

340
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
Everyone, please pay attention

341
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,079
Let us solemnly invite the hosts of this wedding

342
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,920

343
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:44,880
First, please welcome

Next, please welcome the bride mother

349
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,160

Please come on stage

354
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,400
Everyone, put on your glasses

355
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,319
The antimatter engine will start soon

356
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,160
There will be a strong flash

357
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:28,759
Glasses

358
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,759
Put them on

359
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,359
Ms. Cai Xiaoying

360
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,240
Please come on stage

361
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,480
We are short on time

362
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,839
Soon we will miss the spaceship

363
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,599
Hurry, get in the car

364
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,680
Let us go

365
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,519
Hurry up

366
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,359
Ms. Cai Xiaoying

367
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,599
Please come on stage

368
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,240
Ms. Cai Xiaoying

369
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,599
Thank you all for coming

370
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,839
My mom just told me

371
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,599
she has something urgent now

372
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,440
so she cannot attend our wedding

373
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,000
Thank you, everyone

374
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,680
Thank you, thank you

375
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,160
What, what happened

376
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,200
My mom, she

377
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,640
had to go away on a trip

378
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,799
But she should still attend

379
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,400
her own daughter’s wedding

380
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,119
Why leave at such a moment

381
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,000
It is fine, she

382
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,240
it is my wedding, not hers

383
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,680
As long as her blessing is here

384
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,559
Come on, let us do the procedure

385
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,319
Do the procedure

386
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,480
Next, let us quickly do the procedure

387
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,519
The ceremony is complete

388
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:00,799
Okay

389
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,160
Okay

390
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay

391
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,599
Okay, keep smiling

392
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,079
Keep smiling

393
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:22,960
Bride, move a bit to the right

394
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,359
Okay

395
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,559
Okay

396
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,759
One two three

397
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,440
A lifetime of harmony

398
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,359
Thank you, uncle, thank you, uncle, come on

399
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,599
Li Li

400
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,359
Sis

401
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,759
Happy wedding day, happy wedding day

402
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,680
Congrats, bro, congrats, bro

403
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,640
No hard feelings, okay

404
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,519
Next time I will bring some seeds to your place

405
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,079
Look at the camera, look at the camera

406
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,680
Three two one

407
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,720
Ten o clock direction

408
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,160
That woman has something going on with Old Li

409
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,400
Look into it

410
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,920
Sis, I am getting married here

411
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,000
Fine

412
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,799
Then report back to me tomorrow

413
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,839
Smile, smile

414
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,599
Come on, one more shot

415
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,000
Mom, are you leaving so fast because something happened

416
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
I will explain it to you later

417
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,079
Okay

418
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
You have worked hard, really, thank you

419
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,640
Take good care of yourselves

420
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,160
You must, really must, take good care

421
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,440
Then when will you come back

422
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,680
I am not coming back

423
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,039
Congratulations, congratulations

424
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,559
Director Li

425
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,680
Director Li

426
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,519
This is my husband

427
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,519
He is really handsome and talented

428
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,559
Wish you both happiness

429
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,720
Come on, come on

430
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,279
One two three

431
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,160
Okay

432
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,799
Congrats

433
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,480
Congrats, congrats

434
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,839
How can you just leave like that

435
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
It is too sudden

436
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,759
You did not even give me a heads up

437
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,039
Meng Hang

438
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,240
Meng Hang

439
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,400
I have to say a few words to you

440
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Usually

441
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,200
Go to bed early and get up early

442
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,079
Stop always eating late night snacks

443
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,119
If you die young

444
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,440
Li Li will end up a widow

445
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,400
You should also talk to Li Li

446
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,400
Tell her not to work overtime all night

447
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,559
Those mistresses around her boss

448
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,759
You can never catch them all

449
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,039
Her own health matters more

450
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,960
Spend more time with Li Li

451
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,640
Do not always go boxing alone

452
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,079
I know

453
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,720
You want to beat up the manager

454
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,319
And that little Cha

455
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,599
Just tell me about it

456
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,519
I have a hundred ways to make them suffer

457
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,920
If you get hurt

458
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,000
Our Li Li

459
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,480
Will have to go to the hospital to take care of you

460
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,480
Make her laugh more

461
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,599
I always say she is not pretty

462
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,279
But actually

463
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,359
She is beautiful when she smiles

464
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,319
Of course, still a bit worse than me

465
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,079
Well, she takes after her dad

466
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,640
Today

467
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,960
I give you my greatest treasure

468
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,720
And put her in your hands

469
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,599
Meng Hang

470
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,720
Do not mess this up on me

471
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,359
I miss my mom

472
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,960
Next

473
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,160
It will be brought to you by me

474
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:32,920
Little Liu Qian

475
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,400
I will perform a magic trick for everyone

476
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,240
Appearing person illusion

477
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
When did he learn that

478
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
He arranged it himself

479
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,960
Now

480
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,599
There is nothing inside here

481
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,559
Completely empty

482
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,000
In a moment

483
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:48,200
I will make a living person appear

484
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,079
Next

485
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,640
is the moment to witness a miracle

486
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,079
Everyone, together with me

487
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,240
count down from five

488
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,000
Five

489
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,000
Four

490
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,240
Three

491
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,200
Two

492
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,119
One

493
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,119
Appearing Person Illusion

494
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,799
Applause

495
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:09,799
There is none

496
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,720
What is going on

497
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,839
There is no one

498
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,400
Jin Jin Shu, come out

499
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,319
Where is he

500
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,519
Jin Shu

501
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,160
Where is he, the trick is busted

502
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,880
Hurry and come out

503
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,519
Uncle, where are you

504
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,640
What is going on

505
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,200
You cannot get in from behind the box at all

506
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,920
Darn

507
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,839
What kind of prop is this

508
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
This

509
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,640
We will pause the magic trick for now

510
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,279
Next, Uncle Meng's Naked Mole Rat Band

511
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,680
will bring you a song

512
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,640
What is that glowing

513
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:08,839
Mom

514
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,519
Mom

515
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,640
Mom is pranking us

516
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,119
She wants to surprise us, that is a good idea

517
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,400
Today

518
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,839
the groom's moms and dads are all gathered here

519
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,319
Bride

520
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,039
you also have a mother

521
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,759
I am right here

522
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,000
Here

523
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,240
is the time to witness

524
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,960
the moment of a miracle

525
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,960
Okay

526
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,599
Okay

527
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,799
I want to get off

528
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,000
Do not make trouble, auntie, what kind of joke is this

529
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:23,759
I am serious

530
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,759
Send me back

531
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,519
Why do you want to get off

532
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,200
Have you ever had someone you could not stop worrying about

533
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,240
That person

534
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,599
Sometimes keeps you awake at night

535
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,519
And sometimes lets you sleep so soundly

536
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,279
Makes you

537
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,960
Feel very fragile at times

538
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,480
But also makes you feel so strong

539
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,799
Allergic to hugs

540
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,519
Mom

541
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,279
What are you doing

542
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:54,720
I am sorry

543
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,079
You will think a hundred times

544
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,799
Of kicking them to the ends of the earth

545
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,680
Cai Yi

546
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,519
What is going on

547
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,559
He even knelt down and begged me

548
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,400
And for the hundred and first time

549
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,599
You want to keep them by your side

550
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,079
Humans

551
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,559
Ignorant

552
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,920
Fragile

553
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,359
Short lived

554
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,559
Childish

555
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,079
But they have a deadly weapon

556
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,880
And that is love

557
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,039
Dad

558
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,960
Come quick Meng Hang has killed himself

559
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,759
Call him one more time

560
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,440
Do you dare to answer

561
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,119
Dad

562
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,720
Dad

563
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,000
In this lifetime of ours

564
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,079
The number of times you call me is already fixed

565
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,759
Each time you shout it there is one less left

566
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,519
Stop right there

567
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,400
You stop right there

568
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,640
You damn pervert

569
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,440
Sis

570
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,799
I miss you

571
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:39,640
Fine

572
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,640
Okay

573
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,200
Not until today

574
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,920
Did I finally realize

575
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,519
That it is exactly because you are so weird

576
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,799
That in my eyes

577
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,759
You are the most precious kind of adorable

578
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,200
This word is very violent

579
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,039
It pulls me in

580
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,000
Drags me along

581
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
That gravity

582
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,359
Is stronger than a black hole

583
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,160
This is forty three not forty eight

584
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,799
Look

585
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Dad what is wrong with you

586
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,319
Son call the police

587
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:06,839
I will propose one toast

588
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Let us all drink to my in law

589
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,559
You have just arrived on Earth

590
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,799
I am your local guide

591
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:12,759
Starting today

592
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,039
I will be with you all the way to

593
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,000
Your old age and your final farewell

594
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,119
Today Meng Hang and I

595
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,440
Put on these outfits

596
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,680
Turn heads

597
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:20,720
Like crazy

598
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,920
That day

599
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,880
My dad said he would take me away

600
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,039
But

601
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,960
When we were about to board the spaceship

602
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,200
I suddenly thought of my mom

603
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,720
Mom

604
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,160
If I leave today

605
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,720
There is one thing I am afraid of

606
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,480
After I return to my home planet

607
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,960
When I look up at the stars

608
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,680
Every single night

609
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,279
I will keep thinking

610
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,319
Of using the rest of my life

611
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,079
To trade for one more chance

612
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,039
This very moment right now

613
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,279
To let this car

614
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,759
Stop right here

615
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,640
How could I say something so cheesy

616
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,279
Pfui, pfui, pfui

617
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,160
Pfui, pfui

618
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,160
It is not cheesy

619
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,680
It is really sentimental

620
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,119
I have hated sentimentality my whole life

621
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,640
You, hate sentimentality

622
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,119
On the Spring Festival Gala you were the most sentimental

623
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,720
You still, you still claim you hate sentimentality

624
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,279
That, that was

625
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,960
the me from a parallel universe

626
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,720
That is not even the same person

627
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,359
Right

628
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,440
All right

629
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,319
You all go

630
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,119
I am staying

631
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,039
I am not leaving either

632
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,519
I want to stay on Earth too

633
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,880
I cannot part with my deskmate

634
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,680
I will be with Gang Dan even if it kills me

635
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,640
Wherever my beloved is

636
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,839
that is where home is

637
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,839
Right

638
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,519
Go home

639
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,680
Yes

640
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,319
Go home, go home

641
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:49,920
Go home

642
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,759
Go

643
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:52,759
Go home

644
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,640
I did not close my windows at home

645
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
Mother in law, you look so beautiful

646
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,880
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations

647
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Congratulations, congratulations

648
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:16,960
Thank you, same to you

649
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,440
Why are you not leaving anymore

650
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,440
Well

651
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,000
The flight suddenly went up in price

652
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,319
I am not going to be that sucker

653
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,279
Did you not say

654
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,119
that Earth is about to be forcibly demolished

655
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:30,880
Yeah

656
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,920
Then it is perfect for me

657
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:32,960
I will be a holdout

658
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,519
and squeeze a huge payout from it

659
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,440
I mean

660
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,559
give me back the money I gave you

661
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,119
I am allergic

662
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,519
I

663
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,240
I

664
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,640
Happy wedding

665
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,799
Even though my mom still will not admit it

666
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,799
I know

667
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,920
she has already fully

668
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,480
accepted this big family

669
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,400
And also

670
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,440
the name of our group chat

671
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,559
was finally changed by her

672
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,160
Okay, on this very special day

673
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,640
I want to give my blessings to our employee Li Li

674
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,759
And also to Meng Hang

675
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,400
I wish you two

676
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,039
a happy marriage and a long life together

677
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,720
Oh right, Little Meng

678
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,400
here is a friendly reminder

679
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
our Li Li has had professional training

680
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,599
and I have the Heavenly Eye System in my hand

681
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,880
so you had better never do anything to betray her

682
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,200
got it?

683
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:36,440
Here

684
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,680
I wish Li Li and Little Meng a happy marriage

685
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,519
Speaking as the boss

686
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,640
I would rather give you a few days of wedding leave

687
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,279
because that way

688
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,559
it is like giving myself a vacation too

689
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,680
Sister Li

690
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,119
I heard you are getting married

691
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,680
you said you would find me

692
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,079
a guy even more handsome than Peng Yuyan

693
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,440
when are you arranging that for me

694
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,720
I am here waiting for your good news

695
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,559
Love you

696
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,039
Li Li

697
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,480
happy wedding

698
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,519
remember to give me the bouquet

699
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,519
Li Li, Little Meng

700
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,240
I wish you a happy marriage

701
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,519
After you get married

702
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,960
you must be tolerant of each other

703
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,640
do not fuss over every little thing

704
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,079
I have done accounts my whole life

705
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,559
and I have never miscalculated

706
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,799
only this messy account of feelings

707
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,119
I can never work it out clearly

708
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,920
Little Meng

709
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,160
happy wedding

710
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,559
here is another riddle for you

711
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:26,359
What kind of house has no shared area

712
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,880
The answer is

713
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,279
the chambers of your heart

714
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,759
The chambers of your heart

715
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,920
must all belong to Li Li

716
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,519
In the past

717
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,400
I was really against getting married

718
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,200
but after seeing Little Meng and Li Li

719
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,680
I suddenly understood

720
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,960
what it means

721
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,440
to envy lovers, not immortals

722
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,279
I will stop talking

723
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,279
I will go try proposing too

724
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,519
Do you

725
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,119
want to

726
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,119
marry me

727
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:04,599
Group message sent successfully

728
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,240
On my big screen

729
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,559
I can now see the two newlyweds

730
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,599
one of them is a black hole

731
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,159
and the other is also a black hole

732
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,119
Two black holes slowly draw near and collide

733
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,400
releasing gravitational waves of love across the universe

734
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,239
then have a little superman to keep working for me

735
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,760
I wish Sister Li Li a happy wedding

736
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,519
may you be united for a hundred years and have a baby soon

737
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:26,719
Um

738
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,360
who is the best man

739
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,440
send that

740
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
contact info to me

741
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,039
sorry to trouble you
