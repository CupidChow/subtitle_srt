1
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,040
What book are you reading?

2
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,920
Let me see.

3
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,799
Here I am.

4
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,560
War and Peace.

5
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,319
Can you handle all those words?

6
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,680
Ever since your mom moved in,

7
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,840
she and Dad argue every day.

8
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,159
It's like a battlefield.

9
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,800
I just want peace.

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,319
My mom, you know,

11
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,560
she's always fussing.

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,280
She keeps saying Dad's habits are bad.

13
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
She doesn't want to live with him.

14
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,240
I've been playing peacemaker a lot.

15
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,039
Breakfast's ready.

16
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,240
Such a big breakfast!

17
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:25,919
Who made this?

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,960
My mom.

19
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:27,479
Dad.

20
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,719
Mom made all this herself.

21
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,439
She bought it.

22
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,919
Mom.

23
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,960
She wants Dad to eat.

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,000
Sorry about that.

25
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,159
This is fine bran.

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,400
You might not be used to it.

27
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,479
Watch your words.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,400
Dad, why are you upset?

29
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,199
You think I can't tell?

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
She's calling me a wild boar.

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,039
A mountain boar.

32
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:51,759
You—

33
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,000
It's just—

34
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,039
a metaphor.

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,199
She means you—

36
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,360
sharp-tongued,

37
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,080
full of wild energy.

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
Aren't you into rock music?

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,439
Rockers,

40
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,639
they have to be

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
wild, right?

42
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,240
If you can't smooth it over, just stop.

43
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,840
Your cover-up is stiffer than my social ties.

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,759
Your tongue is really sharp.

45
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,680
Must use a lot of disinfectant to brush.

46
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,199
You rinse with Mr. Muscle, don't you?

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,520
You and the alpaca at our shop

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,159
could really be good friends.

49
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,520
What do you mean?

50
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,840
You just have to ask.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,159
Don't you love spitting words at people?

52
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,520
Alpacas spit too.

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,000
You two are a perfect match.

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,280
Together, you make one word.

55
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,800
Mutual support in hardship.

56
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,000
Mom, Mom, Mom—

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,879
Come, listen.

58
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,800
The magpies are singing outside.

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,759
That means today is a good day.

60
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,919
Yes, yes, yes.

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,199
Let's stop arguing and eat.

62
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
What magpie?

63
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,599
It's a dove.

64
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,960
The most annoying bird.

65
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,199
Why do you say that?

66
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,639
You'd burst if you didn't ask.

67
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,560
Turns out,

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
there really was a magpie family here.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,879
A happy magpie family lived here.

70
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,319
Then a dove came.

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,240
It took over their nest.

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,759
No place left to live.

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Had to stay here no matter what.

74
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,800
Why is it calling so loudly?

75
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,560
To the whole—

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,759
apologizing to the world.

77
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,319
Sorry.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,280
Not accepted.

79
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,159
Dad, Dad, Dad—

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,879
Hurry, hurry!

81
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,879
Come back and eat.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,639
Eat this.

83
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,800
This is your favorite bread.

84
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,360
Here, here.

85
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,120
I'll break it up in your porridge.

86
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,439
He's cursing me, isn't he?

87
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,040
Don't play dumb.

88
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,920
I heard, by Earth's laws,

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
if attacked, fighting back

90
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,959
counts as self-defense.

91
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,000
Verbal attacks don't count.

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,079
Besides,

93
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,240
aren't superpowers forbidden?

94
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,759
That knife is all crooked.

95
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,040
Who knows if you'll chop Dad

96
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,959
or Meng Meng?

97
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,079
Feels chilly behind me.

98
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,079
A friend is looking for me.

99
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,399
Well—

100
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,600
You all take your time eating.

101
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,319
Enjoy your meal.

102
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,839
He still has friends?

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Friends—

104
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,680
plenty of them.

105
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,560
This proves

106
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,480
my dad

107
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,279
does have some good points.

108
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,079
Yes, yes.

109
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,839
Good points.

110
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,600
Save those lies

111
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,920
for your clients.

112
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,160
Go to work and make money.

113
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,480
Lao Meng

114
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,120
Lao Yang

115
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,839
How have you been lately?

116
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

117
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,319
Feeling a bit irritable.

118
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,759
Well, you know,

119
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,079
I’m just doting on this little one.

120
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
This is

121
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,839
a chameleon.

122
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,040
In English, it’s

123
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,120
“chameleon.”

124
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,199
Bet you haven’t seen one before.

125
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,160
A chameleon.

126
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,000
Don’t move, don’t move, don’t move.

127
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,680
It’s really precious.

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,439
And it’s even

129
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,360
a female.

130
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:19,800
Yours

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,040
Why does it look different
from the ones on Animal World?

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,439
It doesn’t act the same.

133
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,040
Acting.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,519
It’s an actor.

135
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
When an actress removes her makeup,

136
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,040
can you still recognize her?

137
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,279
Besides,

138
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,199
those with advanced skills

139
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,839
always have the simplest disguise.

140
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
You want it to change color?

141
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,120
Change.

142
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,279
Are you kidding me?

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,759
Can it really change?

144
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,079
A chameleon

145
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,319
in its whole life

146
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,759
can only change color so many times.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
There’s a set limit.

148
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,120
Each time it changes,

149
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,000
it loses one chance.

150
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,600
You can’t afford that, bro.

151
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,000
Look, look.

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,319
This, this, this—

153
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,399
How much does this thing cost?

154
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,279
Not expensive.

155
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,519
Forty or fifty thousand.

156
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,319
Forty or fifty thousand?

157
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,879
That’s definitely a rich person’s pet.

158
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,120
Of course.

159
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,000
Sit, sit, sit.

160
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,759
Please, have a seat.

161
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:08,920
Alright.

162
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,120
It might change soon.

163
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,439
Just put it here,

164
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,920
and my pet shop’s vibe

165
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,800
instantly goes up.

166
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,079
Brightens up the place, right?

167
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,680
Yes, yes.

168
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,240
Lao Yang,

169
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,399
can you lend me this chameleon

170
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,480
for a week?

171
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,639
Help me boost my shop’s image.

172
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,160
Sure.

173
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,600
What do I get out of it?

174
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,720
Well,

175
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,319
one side

176
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,000
of the wall—

177
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,199
pick any three pets you like.

178
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,519
I’ll trade three for one.

179
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,319
You won’t lose out.

180
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,800
I’m the one losing here.

181
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,839
You trade any three pets for my chameleon.

182
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,399
It’s like trading three pairs of underwear

183
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,360
for my trench coat.

184
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,360
Or three Xialis

185
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,319
for my Audi.

186
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,040
Or three national soccer players

187
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,720
for my Messi, you know?

188
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,600
You sure talk slick.

189
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,079
Just like my co-in-law.

190
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,360
Alright.

191
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,000
I’ll trade my shop’s treasure—

192
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,240
an Australian alpaca—

193
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,240
for your chameleon, one week.

194
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:06,879
How’s that?

195
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,319
Deal, deal, deal.

196
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,759
So, one week.

197
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,040
It’s settled.

198
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,519
You know,

199
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
this thing is actually pretty cute.

200
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,279
Lao Yang said

201
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,920
he’s got three chameleons like this.

202
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,519
He has three.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,759
All different colors.

204
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,759
If one can

205
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,439
change into a hundred colors,

206
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:31,959
then tell me,

207
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,159
how many color combinations for three?

208
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,679
That’s one hundred times—

209
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,960
Why am I even calculating that?

210
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,320
So you mean

211
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,000
you want to show me some color?

212
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,960
Three hundred million.

213
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,279
No, don’t get me wrong.

214
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,559
You just said it’s cute.

215
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,039
Later,

216
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,039
all three chameleons

217
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
will be brought back.

218
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,639
Co-in-law,

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,519
take them out for a walk.

220
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,120
If I go out with three chameleons,

221
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,360
I’m the Mother of Dragons!

222
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,039
They’re my dragon babies.

223
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,360
Just imagine—

224
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,320
you’re holding them,

225
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,679
red, green, yellow one moment,

226
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,960
green, yellow, red the next,

227
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,159
then yellow, red, green.

228
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,600
So impressive.

229
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
Might as well open a hair salon.

230
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,120
Dragon babies are here.

231
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,159
Keep a good eye on them.

232
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,679
I’m just stepping out.

233
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,080
Where are you going?

234
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
To Lao Yang’s pet shop.

235
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,080
Aren’t you two competitors?

236
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,000
Now we’re partners.

237
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,240
He left the chameleon with me.

238
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,679
I have to take the alpaca to him.

239
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,519
It’s the pet version of Zhaojun’s Journey.

240
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
You’re cultured, little sis.

241
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,759
You got it exactly right.

242
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,759
I’ll be right back.

243
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,039
Do you feel stuffy?

244
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
Let me give you some fresh air, okay?

245
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,759
Liao Kai

246
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,360
sold two duplex apartments this month.

247
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
Let’s give a round of applause!

248
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,320
Lao Cha

249
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,639
Six units

250
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,159
Take a look

251
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,279
What makes a sales genius

252
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,000
If we had five Lao Chas like this

253
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,279
we wouldn't have to worry at all

254
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:07,919
Keep it low-key

255
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,639
Low-key

256
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,480
That's right

257
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,480
Is it "Five Lao Cha Power"?

258
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,559
Speak

259
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,720
Manager

260
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,440
Of those six units Lao Cha sold

261
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,039
I showed two of them to clients

262
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,639
The clients agreed to sign with me

263
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,360
But then Lao Cha

264
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,120
secretly

265
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,320
snatched them from me

266
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,320
Hang Hang

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,320
You're giving me too much credit

268
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,399
Clients

269
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,559
can sign with whoever they want

270
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,120
It's not up to me, Lao Cha

271
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:35,919
But I

272
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,440
Meng Hang

273
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,879
Is it so hard to admit others are better?

274
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,080
Is it really that hard?

275
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,759
Your performance is at the bottom again

276
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
I just don't get it

277
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,159
You're a sales loser

278
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,919
How dare you mess with us top sales?

279
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
That's funny

280
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,200
Enough

281
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,679
Here's something urgent

282
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,279
We just got a new

283
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,559
tricky property

284
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,840
In the client group

285
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
it's causing a huge stir

286
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,320
They're calling it a haunted house

287
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,240
Has anyone here

288
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
ever dealt with haunted houses before?

289
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,399
Haunted house

290
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,200
I spend every day in a haunted house

291
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
It's full of ghosts even in broad daylight

292
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,600
Vampire boss

293
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,399
Clueless manager

294
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,240
Stingy clients

295
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,799
Scheming coworkers

296
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,799
And me, the scapegoat

297
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,120
taking the fall for the boss

298
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm burning with ghostly rage

299
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,639
Someone has to report this to HQ

300
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,919
Who should go?

301
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,960
Who do we send?

302
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,120
Let's have you go

303
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,360
Fine

304
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,200
What?

305
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
Didn't we just say

306
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,279
we need to send a Stayover Tester

307
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,440
to try out the haunted house

308
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,000
Livestream to bust the rumors

309
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,799
Let's see who volunteers

310
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,600
Only you

311
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,639
stepped up

312
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,879
and took the lead

313
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,039
You're so cool

314
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,960
I'm just unlucky

315
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,559
Rope always breaks at the thinnest spot

316
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,279
People always pick the softest persimmon

317
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,559
Forget it

318
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,399
Everyone calls me a sales loser

319
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,960
I don't have the right to refuse

320
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,720
Where is it?

321
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,600
Give me the address

322
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,600
Jingjue Ancient City Community

323
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Where's the dragon?

324
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,840
Where's my dragon?

325
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,960
It's in the cage

326
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,919
Where?

327
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,799
It's not here

328
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,440
How could that be?

329
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,399
Isn't this

330
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,639
It's gone

331
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,600
I know it's gone

332
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,919
Didn't I tell you to watch it?

333
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,000
You told me to watch the cage

334
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,440
The cage is still here

335
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,639
You're talking about the cage

336
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,519
I said dragon

337
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,240
Can't you hear me?

338
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,399
You said cage

339
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,320
I said

340
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,840
dragon

341
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Isn't that the same?

342
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,600
Where's the dragon?

343
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,879
Humans

344
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,759
are so fragile

345
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,279
Where's my dragon?

346
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,240
Where's my dragon?

347
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,519
Such a big creature

348
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,279
How could it just disappear?

349
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Nonsense

350
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,279
Chameleons

351
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,000
change color with their environment

352
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,279
You think it's that easy to find?

353
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,879
They've evolved for two hundred million years

354
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,480
Was all that evolution for nothing?

355
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,519
So what now?

356
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,720
I've got an idea

357
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,360
Co-in-law, you

358
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,000
What are you doing?

359
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,399
No

360
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,600
We're just pure relatives

361
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,240
Get lost

362
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,519
Keep dreaming

363
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,159
No, wait

364
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,320
What do you mean?

365
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,960
That chameleon

366
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,440
can change with its environment, right?

367
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,120
I'll keep changing the environment's color

368
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,360
That way

369
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,679
I'll tire it out

370
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,519
and it'll be easy to catch

371
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,279
The vibe is great

372
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,559
Too bad there's no music

373
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,840
Co-in-law

374
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,600
Did you forget our original goal?

375
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,440
The music's set the mood

376
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,440
Can't stop now

377
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,000
Come on

378
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,960
I'm not that kind of person

379
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,399
Without twenty years in nightclubs

380
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
you can't dance like this

381
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,759
Join in

382
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,360
Sis

383
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,360
What's my little brother like at your place?

384
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,480
You've never mentioned him

385
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm just

386
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,759
curious

387
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,879
Shut up

388
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,759
Look at you.

389
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,559
You change your face

390
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,640
faster than a chameleon.

391
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,880
I looked it up online.

392
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,960
A chameleon's natural enemy is a snake.

393
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:15,960
Clever me,

394
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:16,880
went to the pet shop

395
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,200
and got a pet snake.

396
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,079
I hope it scares the chameleon out.

397
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,160
You, you, you...

398
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,920
Is that a noodle or a snake?

399
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,720
Noodle snake.

400
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,759
A new breed in the pet world.

401
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,960
Are you trying to

402
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,640
uh,

403
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,880
feed the chameleon extra?

404
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:38,640
No.

405
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,319
Don't be fooled by its size.

406
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,039
It's a local snake.

407
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,799
The ancestors said it well.

408
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,880
A mighty dragon can't crush a local snake.

409
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,079
You sure have a bunch of twisted logic.

410
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,519
I'm telling you,

411
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,759
what the ancestors said

412
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,920
makes sense.

413
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,119
It does.

414
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,920
But let me remind you,

415
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,119
your local snake fell to the floor.

416
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,720
It's gone.

417
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,640
Where's the snake?

418
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,880
Oh my goodness!

419
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,440
Where did it go?

420
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Come out, hurry!

421
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,279
There are nooks and crannies everywhere.

422
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,319
How do we even find it?

423
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,240
Luckily,

424
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,200
this little noodle

425
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,359
is harmless and non-venomous.

426
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,279
That's good.

427
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,279
Are you sure?

428
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,319
Look,

429
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,079
the one on the left

430
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,039
is the pet snake you mentioned.

431
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,440
The one on the right

432
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,240
is the snake you keep.

433
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,440
They look similar,

434
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,440
but they're very different.

435
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:48,799
How

436
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,559
different?

437
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,039
It's like

438
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,079
the difference between a husky and a wolf.

439
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,400
They look alike,

440
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,440
but raising them

441
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,160
one can wreck your door,

442
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
the other can wipe out your family.

443
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,640
This one is

444
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,240
an African tree snake.

445
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,519
It's highly venomous.

446
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,279
One bite

447
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,480
and you're done for.

448
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,400
Darn it.

449
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,720
Now we're a venomous snake family.

450
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,920
No way.

451
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,000
I need to pack my bags right now.

452
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,200
Are you going to give this house

453
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,319
to the snake?

454
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,839
I have to move out fast.

455
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,400
Or else, if it jumps out,

456
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,240
and bites me,

457
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,640
I'll die right here.

458
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,680
Then this house becomes a haunted house.

459
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,839
I have to move out.

460
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,079
I have to move out.

461
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,480
Go ahead, move.

462
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,119
Well,

463
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:34,599
move out.

464
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,400
With all these things crawling around,

465
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,279
you're just going to ignore it?

466
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,680
You know, you

467
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,319
Anyone who calls this a haunted house is an idiot.

468
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,960
This is such a nice house.

469
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,720
A house.

470
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,680
There are no ghosts in this world.

471
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,599
If there were ghosts,

472
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,920
as the old saying goes,

473
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,519
even ghosts fear the wicked.

474
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,440
With me looking this tough,

475
00:20:59,319 --> 00:20:59,920
Manager.

476
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,799
Where are you?

477
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,279
I'm at

478
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,519
Jingjue Ancient City Community.

479
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,720
Didn't I tell you to go at night?

480
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,880
Why did you go during the day?

481
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,240
I thought I'd come early to check things out.

482
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,720
No, manager,

483
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,920
please let me go back.

484
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,720
Really, I'll do anything.

485
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:16,599
Then help Lao Cha

486
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,480
sell a few unfinished apartments in Yanjiao.

487
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,079
No way.

488
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,400
I can't scam people.

489
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,000
Then stay here and be my stayover tester.

490
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,119
Livestream for the netizens tonight.

491
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,880
Otherwise,

492
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,880
I'll fire you.

493
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:29,680
Manager.

494
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,559
Man—

495
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,359
Snake

496
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,440
Where is it? Where?

497
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,079
Where is it?

498
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:01,799
It's on your foot.

499
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,960
I was mistaken.

500
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:05,759
It's just a shoelace.

501
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,319
You really are...

502
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,160
Dark.

503
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,039
I have another house.

504
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,720
I'll have the tenant move out first.

505
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,519
We'll move in there.

506
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,039
After we outlast the snake,

507
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,079
we'll move back here.

508
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,880
I checked.

509
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,480
Snakes can live for over ten years.

510
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,880
Looking at you,

511
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,359
the snake might outlast you.

512
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,599
Here they come.

513
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,599
I was dying to get out.

514
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,759
Lao Meng,

515
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,640
you're something else.

516
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,720
You keep such a big Buddha at home.

517
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,279
What's with your look?

518
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,160
It's me.

519
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,160
Sorry, sorry.

520
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,519
My old eyes are blurry.

521
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,319
Young lady,

522
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,319
what are you...

523
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,119
Why are you sitting on the table?

524
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,319
I'm sitting here because

525
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,480
someone said women can't sit at the table.

526
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,279
I have to let my co-in-laws

527
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,559
sit right at the table.

528
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,680
To show us women

529
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,279
have a very high status.

530
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,960
If Wang Jie finds out we have a snake,

531
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,640
she'll get the Owners' Committee

532
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,720
to kick us all out.

533
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,559
Where is she?

534
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,160
She seems to have gone to the bathroom.

535
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,680
Wang Jie,

536
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,759
our toilet is broken.

537
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:21,000
Can I use your bathroom?

538
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,359
She really treats herself like family.

539
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,000
What's wrong now?

540
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,400
I searched everywhere just now.

541
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,000
Only the bathroom I didn't check.

542
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,759
The snake could be in the bathroom.

543
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,039
Really?

544
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,200
Go check.

545
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:37,599
What now?

546
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,960
Are you just watching?

547
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,519
Out, out, out!

548
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,200
We...

549
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,400
She won't let us look.

550
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,000
These tiles are gorgeous.

551
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,640
I replaced them.

552
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,039
What's going on?

553
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,960
Eavesdropping outside the bathroom?

554
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,039
You won't even let me talk.

555
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,200
Family,

556
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,240
I'm now at Jingjue Ancient City Community's

557
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,519
Capital

558
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,440
No. 18 house.

559
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,920
The legendary

560
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,599
haunted house.

561
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,119
Today,

562
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,359
I'm going to be a Stayover Tester for one night.

563
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,160
The goal

564
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,400
is to shatter those

565
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
ridiculous rumors.

566
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,519
Nothing happened.

567
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:33,759
Friends,

568
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,200
tonight

569
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,519
I'm sleeping right here.

570
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,759
Let's see

571
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,079
what will actually happen.

572
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,079
So...

573
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:40,720
So...

574
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,880
Darn, the battery's dead.

575
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
Luckily, I brought a charger.

576
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,640
Who's there?

577
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,480
No one.

578
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,519
Hallucination.

579
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,440
Hallucination.

580
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,119
Definitely a hallucination.

581
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,720
Who's there?

582
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,039
Snake!

583
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,599
You're such a pervert!

584
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:51,799
Meng Hang.

585
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,880
I rushed in

586
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,519
because she yelled "snake."

587
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,079
Then she attacked me with this weapon.

588
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,599
It took ages to pull it out.

589
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
I finally got it off.

590
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,119
She said it broke.

591
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,160
Your bathroom's shower rod

592
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,119
suddenly broke.

593
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,079
It hit her.

594
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,680
When I heard it,

595
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,599
I'd already rushed in.

596
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,480
Officer,

597
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,400
it's really a misunderstanding.

598
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,359
Just a total mix-up.

599
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,799
Forget it.

600
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,160
Co-in-laws,

601
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,880
please help me plead with the officer.

602
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,680
Okay.

603
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,519
Officer,

604
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,599
please

605
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:30,680
show some mercy.

606
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,319
Right.

607
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,640
He's timid.

608
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,640
Could you

609
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,359
change the execution to injection?

610
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,559
Did I offend you?

611
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:37,839
You...

612
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,359
What's wrong?

613
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,319
You want to torture me?

614
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,759
You...

615
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,680
You want me to...

616
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,160
Me...

617
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:41,839
You two elders

618
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:42,920
should stop arguing.

619
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:43,960
Since

620
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,599
Grandma Wang isn't pressing charges,

621
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,599
I think

622
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,359
this matter

623
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,400
should end here.

624
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:49,799
From now on,

625
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,319
please don't be so impulsive.

626
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:51,799
Not impulsive.

627
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:52,640
Not impulsive.

628
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,160
Alright.

629
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,839
We'll head out now.

630
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,920
Okay, goodbye.

631
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,480
Sorry for the trouble.

632
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,319
No need to see us out.

633
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,119
Take care.

634
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,279
What are you staring at?

635
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,000
We need to replace our plunger.

636
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:05,599
It's not round.

637
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,960
Meng Hang

638
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:12,640
Meng Hang

639
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,200
Meng Hang

640
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,960
Meng Hang

641
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,359
Me

642
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,039
It's me

643
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:16,519
Meng Hang

644
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,759
Me

645
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,119
Meng Hang, me

646
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,720
Lili

647
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:24,880
Why are you here?

648
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:25,960
I was secretly watching your livestream

649
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,039
It suddenly cut off

650
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,640
I got worried about you

651
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,440
So I came to check on you

652
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:28,960
Let's go, quick

653
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:29,759
What happened here?

654
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,039
This is a haunted house

655
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,599
That room is haunted

656
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,319
That room

657
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,319
Impossible

658
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,759
After humans die

659
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,559
They entangle with dark energy
in a quantum state

660
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,680
Waiting for Poincaré recurrence

661
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,160
There are no ghosts at all

662
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,160
Let's go, hurry

663
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,640
Go, quick

664
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:44,519
Hurry

665
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:46,960
Let me take a look

666
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,519
Come on, come on

667
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,119
Don't go

668
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:49,720
Go, go, go

669
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,079
Quick, quick

670
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,559
Don't go

671
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,519
That room

672
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,039
There's nothing there

673
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,279
Just now

674
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,279
It was right there

675
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:02,799
Right there

676
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:04,920
This

677
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,599
It was just right there

678
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,359
This

679
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:09,799
Look

680
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,839
Hold this

681
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,880
This

682
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,359
It's fake

683
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,839
There's nothing here

684
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,720
See?

685
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,119
Why would I lie to you?

686
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:29,839
It's fine

687
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,160
I really didn't lie to you

688
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,640
It's okay

689
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,039
I really didn't

690
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,799
Let's go outside and check

691
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,720
I swear I didn't lie to you

692
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,039
It's fine, it's fine

693
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:19,680
Don't hit

694
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,440
No, no, no

695
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,160
Don't hit, don't hit

696
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,839
It's me

697
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,000
It's me

698
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,400
It's me

699
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm one of us

700
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,359
You

701
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,119
Why are you pretending to be a ghost here?

702
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,400
He is, he is...

703
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,440
Just...

704
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,680
Meng Hang

705
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,799
Does it look good?

706
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,279
Lao Cha

707
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,400
Let me explain, let me explain

708
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,079
I have my reasons

709
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,119
Here's the thing

710
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,519
I have a client

711
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,119
He likes this house

712
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:54,920
But

713
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
He thinks the price is too high

714
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:56,880
So he bribed me

715
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,960
Asked me to spread rumors

716
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,319
Saying this is a haunted house

717
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,279
It's a haunted house

718
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,559
He even promised me

719
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,400
That...

720
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:02,960
He'd give me

721
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,400
A discount on the price

722
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,039
Twenty percent as a kickback

723
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,720
A little bonus

724
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,400
So

725
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,720
Lao Meng came to stay over

726
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,279
Lao Cha scared him

727
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,160
And made him leave

728
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,160
Rap

729
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,640
That's what happened

730
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,240
Yeah

731
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,559
You must be tired

732
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,000
Of course

733
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,799
I haven't even eaten

734
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,720
Come here

735
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,799
I'll get you something to eat

736
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:24,720
What good food?

737
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,359
Eat my electric blast

738
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,079
At this point

739
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,359
I have to lure the snake out

740
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,279
How do we lure it?

741
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,720
Snakes like to eat mice

742
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,440
I have a hamster at my shop

743
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,920
Lao Meng

744
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,759
Can you hand me this box, please?

745
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,880
Thank you

746
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,759
Let's go, baby

747
00:32:59,559 --> 00:32:59,920
You

748
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:00,839
What are you doing?

749
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,200
I found you have a magical ability

750
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:04,839
That is

751
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,400
You can mess things up

752
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,359
All over again

753
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,119
So

754
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,160
Anyway, soon

755
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,599
You'll have to release the hamster

756
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:11,839
You drive me half mad

757
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,759
So

758
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,640
Let me release it for you

759
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,599
How do you know that's Lao Cha?

760
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,480
Earlier

761
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,759
I met Lao Cha

762
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,640
He has a strong

763
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,200
cologne scent on him

764
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,920
That room smelled just like it

765
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,440
Really? You have a sharp nose

766
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,000
You're absolutely insane

767
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:27,599
You

768
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,759
No

769
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,000
What's going on?

770
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,920
Is it that serious?

771
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,000
It's not that bad

772
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,039
Mom

773
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,680
At this point

774
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,559
Why not use superpower

775
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,119
Make all the furniture float

776
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,480
Wouldn't that make it easy to find?

777
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,719
What about those two?

778
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,760
Let them hide in the furniture

779
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,480
Meng Hang

780
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,360
Meng Hang

781
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,440
I think

782
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,159
We should do like Lao Cha

783
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,599
Hide in the dark

784
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,880
Then the little animals will come out

785
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,599
Where should we hide?

786
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,000
In the wardrobe

787
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,800
Mom

788
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,840
You do it.

789
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,760
Looks like it's out of air.

790
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,960
I finally get what "greedy snake" means.

791
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,840
Judging by the shape,

792
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,719
this one's a hamster,

793
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,079
and this one's a chameleon.

794
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:22,719
Darn it.

795
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,679
It's all ruined.

796
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,360
Crashed.

797
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,239
What are you fussing over?

798
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,639
To welcome the alpaca home,

799
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,960
I made it a treat myself.

800
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,679
How did you steal this alpaca?

801
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,679
Steal? What do you mean?

802
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,440
I traded for it fair and square!

803
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
Your chameleon is dead.

804
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
What did you use to trade?

805
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,559
What chameleon?

806
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,000
That was clearly a lizard.

807
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,960
I got two geckos

808
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:03,960
and traded them for it.

809
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,440
You and Lao Yang,

810
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,400
you really make a pair.

811
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,760
One lacks morals,

812
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,119
one lacks brains.

813
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:13,920
I'm in a good mood,

814
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,760
so I won't argue.

815
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,400
Alpaca.

816
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,599
Come on, time to eat, alpaca.

817
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,719
Lao Yang.

818
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,199
I'm not done with you.

819
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,519
Bring some cumin back, too.

820
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
This family...

821
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,559
Dragon, snake, rat, sheep,

822
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,679
chicken, ox, dog, rabbit—

823
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,079
all twelve zodiac animals are here.

824
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,599
I can put up with all that.

825
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,760
Living together in one home,

826
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,920
what can't I tolerate?

827
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,519
Right?

828
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,480
Except for that one.

829
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,360
I really can't stand him.

830
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,400
"Beijing Night"

831
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,760
I left so much love behind.

832
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:05,760
Did you hear that?

833
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,320
Did you hear it or not?

834
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,079
At your age,

835
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,239
singing such racy lyrics—

836
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,199
have you no shame?

837
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm done listening.

838
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,079
I can't just beat him to death.

839
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:15,719
Right?

840
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,400
Gotta follow Earth's laws, don't I?

841
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,199
Yeah.

842
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,079
Officer,

843
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,519
I'd like to report anonymously.

844
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,280
There's a hooligan disturbing us.

845
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,480
Okay.

846
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Please come quickly.
