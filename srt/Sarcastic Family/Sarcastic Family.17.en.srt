1
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,519
Why are you still counting every day?

2
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,480
Are you that desperate to go back?

3
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,719
I’ve had more than enough here.

4
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,159
Do you want to go back with me?

5
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,079
I’m not going back.

6
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,159
My work here isn’t finished yet.

7
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,240
Besides,

8
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,000
I can’t just abandon Mengmeng.

9
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,280
Let me put it this way.

10
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,560
Ask those humans this:

11
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,599
Suppose a biologist

12
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,759
goes into a forest to study monkeys,

13
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,759
and in the end,

14
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,840
falls in love with a monkey

15
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,360
and even lives with that monkey,

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,120
wouldn’t they think

17
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
that this biologist is insane?

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,280
Mom, that’s really not okay.

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,520
How can you compare Mengmeng to a monkey?

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,879
Right.

21
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,680
Okay, fine, fine.

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,639
He’s not even as good as a monkey.

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,840
If it really doesn’t work,

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
you can just take him with you.

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,919
But let’s be clear first:

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,159
according to our home planet’s

27
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,919
entry requirements,

28
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,080
someone like him

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,199
has to be treated as

30
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,280
pet cargo.

31
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,639
That won’t do.

32
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,960
And what about his dad?

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,879
He’s so old already,

34
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,879
you can’t put him in a cage.

35
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,319
His dad won’t work.

36
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,039
Exactly.

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
His dad counts as

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,919
an invasive harmful species.

39
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,360
He must be destroyed at entry.

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
In Kaifeng there’s Bao Qingtian,

41
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,719
stern and selfless, sorting good from bad.

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,240
I wrote this lyric at twenty.

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,599
It’s actually quite fun.

44
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,919
Clouds are Heaven kneading dough,

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,800
planes are delivery guys,

46
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,800
passengers are dumpling filling.

47
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
To Guiying.

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,800
Who wrote this to Hanghang’s mom?

49
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,960
Dear Guiying,

50
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,759
this time meeting you

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,599
is destined to stay with me for life.

52
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,479
January fifteenth,

53
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,479
same old place for the two of us.

54
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,000
Be there, or it’s not over.

55
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,240
Liu Jie,

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,680
uh,

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,560
y-y-you

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,000
come to my pet shop right away.

59
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,039
Yes, yes.

60
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,560
It’s urgent.

61
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,159
Really urgent.

62
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:04,840
Come right now.

63
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,240
Right now.

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,680
Yeah.

65
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,280
Earth Observation Log.

66
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,240
If Earth exploded,

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,319
where would humanity go?

68
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,079
In Quadrant Three of Andromeda,

69
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,319
a massive explosion occurred.

70
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,519
The Interstellar Alliance sent beacons

71
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,720
to 17 stars within 30 light-years.

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,439
At the observation coordinates in

73
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,839
Quadrant Three, a fierce cosmic blast was seen.

74
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
The star was ultra-dense.

75
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,120
Chief Editor,

76
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,720
Chief Editor, are you there?

77
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
Matter is drawn from the companion star,
forming jets.

78
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,000
Why is there no signal?

79
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,319
Chief Editor?

80
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,480
Chief Editor?

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,560
Chief Editor?

82
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
You have completely lost contact
with the home planet.

83
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,360
Connection cannot be restored.

84
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,399
You have completely lost contact
with the home planet.

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,319
Connection cannot be restored.

86
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,879
In Sector 54-32-9,

87
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,920
17 stars may face total destruction.

88
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,279
Liu Jie

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,920
Back then, Guiying

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,399
got along best with you.

91
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,480
Let’s be honest.

92
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,000
The one who wrote this letter,

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,720
said he’d come to my place to see her.

94
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,439
Who was it?

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,759
You and Guiying

96
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,399
have been divorced for years.

97
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,000
Why still care about this?

98
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:22,720
I get it.

99
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,199
Biaozi?

100
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,199
No.

101
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,319
Big Head?

102
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Big Head is my husband.

103
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,560
Then who?

104
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,480
Who on earth is it?

105
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,000
It’s…

106
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,120
All right, all right.

107
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,920
Stop guessing wildly.

108
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,240
I’ll lay it out for you.

109
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,360
It’s Zhiqiang.

110
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,279
Hou Zhiqiang.

111
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,120
Hou Zhiqiang, the boiler guy.

112
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,800
Right.

113
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,079
He and Guiying

114
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,839
were childhood sweethearts.

115
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,399
When they were in school,

116
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,959
they did have a thing.

117
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,759
But later on,

118
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,319
you cut in and stole her away.

119
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,120
So,

120
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,000
while I wasn’t home,

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,519
behind my back,

122
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,240
they picked things up again.

123
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,720
Those two…

124
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,959
This letter

125
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,279
was written thirty years ago.

126
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,360
You brooding over this now,

127
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,560
does it mean anything?

128
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,720
It doesn’t.

129
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,800
It really doesn’t.

130
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:13,680
Take a look.

131
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Look at the day they met.

132
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,560
The meeting date:

133
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
January fifteenth.

134
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,079
Right.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,680
What about it?

136
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,120
Then…

137
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,759
this line:

138
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,160
“This meeting

139
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,519
I am destined to

140
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,839
never forget all my life.”

141
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,959
“Never forget all my life,” huh?

142
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,759
So what about that?

143
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,480
Nothing.

144
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,600
Liu Jie,

145
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,319
sorry to trouble you.

146
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,120
Thanks a lot, really.

147
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,720
Go handle your things first.

148
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,439
I’ll net two fish for you,

149
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,519
let your grandson keep them.

150
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,079
No need.

151
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,600
They’re really nice, though.

152
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,600
I’m heading out.

153
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Okay, okay.

154
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,800
They met in 1993,

155
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
on January fifteenth.

156
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,680
Hanghang was in 1993

157
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,519
born on November eleventh.

158
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,560
Exactly ten months apart.

159
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,079
If you leave, go alone.

160
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,199
Leave Hanghang with me.

161
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
You still dare want this kid?

162
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,240
Does he have anything to do with you?

163
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,000
Look at yourself—

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,319
do you look like a father?

165
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,319
Darn it

166
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,560
Mom

167
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,279
Mom, I need to tell you something.

168
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,439
That Musk is insanely rich.

169
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,519
He launches rockets every day.

170
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,439
I only ever had one rocket.

171
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,399
Old Gao gave it to me.

172
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,519
And I kicked it away.

173
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,199
Tell me,

174
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,480
this Musk,

175
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,560
fires rockets to send humans

176
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,199
off to other planets.

177
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,079
If I tell Old Ma

178
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,399
aliens are already on Earth,

179
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,759
and ask him for 2 billion,

180
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,759
that’s not too much, right?

181
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
Mom, you’re money‑crazy.

182
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,920
I want to tell you something.

183
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,959
About our home planet...

184
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,360
Don’t mention the home planet.

185
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,319
I miss home so much it’s crazy.

186
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,639
I can’t hear anything about going back.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,920
The other day I heard

188
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
Fei Xiang sing that song,

189
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,839
“Clouds of home drift at the horizon,”

190
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,000
“they keep calling out to me.”

191
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,040
It blew up, it blew up.

192
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,240
It blew up.

193
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,159
You already know?

194
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,840
Y‑yeah.

195
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,200
Of course I know.

196
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,720
Isn’t it just that

197
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,679
Starship exploded?

198
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,919
No, Mom,

199
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,320
our home planet exploded.

200
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,080
Mom...

201
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,039
We’ve got no home now, Mom.

202
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,639
Look how useless you are.

203
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,559
Cry here by yourself.

204
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,519
I’m going out to buy things.

205
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,960
Mom...

206
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,639
Looks like this Earth Observation Log

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,399
isn’t much use anymore.

208
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,200
Really, lucky in our misfortune.

209
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,039
Good thing the three of us are here.

210
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,120
That’s just fate.

211
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,080
Yeah.

212
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,879
If that’s the case,

213
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,879
I have to find a partner.

214
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,879
After all, I’m S Planet’s

215
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,000
last remaining man.

216
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,240
For our species to go on,

217
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,399
I can’t even be faithful.

218
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,759
I’ve got to date several.

219
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,399
This mission

220
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,600
suddenly fell on my shoulders.

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,559
I can only reluctantly become

222
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,799
an S Planet playboy.

223
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,799
Shut that mouth of yours.

224
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,159
Mom.

225
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,720
I’ve figured it out.

226
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,080
When in Rome,

227
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,559
do as the Romans do.

228
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,360
Humans

229
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,159
hold memorials

230
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,440
when relatives die.

231
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,159
I’ll also hold one

232
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,840
for my S Planet.

233
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,039
What?

234
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,720
Our home planet is gone.

235
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,039
We must settle down on Earth.

236
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,559
That means we need even more money.

237
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,519
We have so many alien friends.

238
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,840
Perfect chance to collect cash gifts.

239
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,440
I’ll go contact Big Liu now.

240
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,879
No wonder since childhood Meng Hang

241
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,159
kept saying he looks nothing like me.

242
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,080
Our personalities are so different.

243
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,320
I’m energetic and restless,

244
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,360
he’s quiet and calm.

245
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,320
Our hobbies are totally different.

246
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,519
I like rock music,

247
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,840
he likes pop.

248
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,240
That’s what I’ve been saying.

249
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,120
How could my kid

250
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,960
possibly like pop?

251
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,279
Besides,

252
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,399
I drank every day when I was young.

253
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,919
My fertility was already affected.

254
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,759
What the hell is all this nonsense?

255
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,240
These satellites are like servant maids
buried with the dead.

256
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,759
In the afterlife,

257
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,840
they’ll keep it company in orbit.

258
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,000
Dear friends and relatives,

259
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,799
let us, in deepest sorrow,

260
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,240
mourn Old Lady Planet S.

261
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,080
Old Lady Planet S—

262
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,399
it’s personification,

263
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,480
makes her sound closer to us.

264
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,720
Just like Earth people

265
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,639
all call Earth “Mother Earth.”

266
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,559
Due to a supernova explosion,

267
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,799
she has recently

268
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,320
passed away, sadly.

269
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,440
At the ripe age of

270
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,159
three point two billion years.

271
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,320
Gone so young, really…

272
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,879
Old Lady Planet S

273
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,840
was born in 3.2 billion BC.

274
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
Her life was full of hardship.

275
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,879
In her youth,

276
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,360
she went through eighteen

277
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,879
global great floods,

278
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,960
ten rounds of

279
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,240
tectonic plate shifts,

280
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,600
and nine

281
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,240
ice ages.

282
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,000
In her later years,

283
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,759
she was widowed, sadly.

284
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,080
Widowed? What’s that about?

285
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,559
Old Lady Planet S

286
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,799
wasn’t she a binary star?

287
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,120
Later the other one

288
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
did nuclear tests

289
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,919
and blew itself up.

290
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,240
Her eight continents and
three great oceans

291
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,360
Right, right, right.

292
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,360
and through untold hardship

293
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,960
she nurtured life.

294
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,159
Her descendants filled the world.

295
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,799
Dad.

296
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,120
You gave me a scare.

297
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,679
You little rascal, you.

298
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Today my client’s coming
to our compound.

299
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,440
I’ll sit here for a bit,

300
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,120
have some tea,

301
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,639
and wait for him.

302
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,320
Sit, sit, sit.

303
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:08,799
Sit.

304
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,480
Such a good kid…

305
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,240
Why is Heaven doing this to me?

306
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,039
No.

307
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,639
I can’t accept this.

308
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,240
We must do a test.

309
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:25,879
Dad.

310
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,840
What tea is this?

311
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,480
That sounds so nice.

312
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,799
I love hearing that.

313
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:33,960
Say it again.

314
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,320
Okay.

315
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,320
Listen carefully.

316
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,000
What tea is this?

317
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,679
You little brat.

318
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,679
You’re just teasing me.

319
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,480
Aren’t you?

320
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,360
Not that line.

321
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Which line then?

322
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,279
Didn’t you say one word before it?

323
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,399
Didn’t you just call me “Dad”?

324
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,480
It made my heart feel so sweet.

325
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,919
Call me that again.

326
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,000
If I call you again,

327
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,519
do you dare answer me?

328
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,879
Why wouldn’t I dare answer?

329
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,240
You scared me with that bowl.

330
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,159
Listen up.

331
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:04,960
Dad.

332
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,240
Dad.

333
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,360
Dad.

334
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,120
Hurry, get in the bowl!

335
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,080
You silly boy.

336
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,399
What’s wrong?

337
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,480
Why do you seem so off?

338
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:24,799
No, I just—

339
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,000
I just suddenly

340
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,080
had a feeling.

341
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,039
In this whole lifetime,

342
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,320
the times you call me “Dad”
are all fixed.

343
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,360
Each call is one less to come.

344
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,600
Don’t talk nonsense.

345
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,519
Come here.

346
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,120
Sit and stay with me a while.

347
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,039
That’s exactly what I’m—

348
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,080
How am I talking nonsense?

349
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,360
If you weren’t my real dad,

350
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,840
I’d suspect you’re taking
advantage of me.

351
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,919
At my age?

352
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,000
Me… taking advantage of you?

353
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,120
You wouldn’t lose out, you’d even—

354
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,799
What are you doing?

355
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,120
Look, you’ve even got gray hair.

356
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,559
Look.

357
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,360
All these years,

358
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,879
I’ve only kept this one white hair,

359
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,399
counting on it to make me look mature.

360
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,159
Oh, cut it out.

361
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,320
In my eyes,

362
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,279
you’ll always be a child.

363
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,919
You need to get some real rest.

364
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,399
You should—

365
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,559
I’ll make you some black sesame later.

366
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,120
And you…

367
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,480
when your client comes later,

368
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,159
if they see you there

369
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,440
hogging the AC and sipping tea,

370
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,000
this deal of yours

371
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
will definitely fall through again.

372
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,679
You’ve got a point.

373
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,840
I’ll go out to greet them.

374
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,159
Yes, yes.

375
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,240
You wait there for them.

376
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,679
Once you’re done,

377
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,639
you can drink all the tea you want.

378
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:22,960
Slow down.

379
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,679
Your tea is really good.

380
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,600
You little punk.

381
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,159
You’re just messing with me.

382
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,080
Slow down.

383
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,159
We must get this tested.

384
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
Only then will I feel at ease.

385
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,079
Now, let’s invite the family rep

386
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,720
to deliver a eulogy.

387
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,519
Go on.

388
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,799
Thank you all

389
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
for attending S Planet’s funeral.

390
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,920
As the saying goes,

391
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,559
“The tree longs for calm, yet wind won’t cease.”

392
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,400
“The child wants to care,

393
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,799
yet the planet will not wait.”

394
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,240
S Planet

395
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,880
compared with the blue Earth,

396
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,799
is not exactly beautiful.

397
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,240
But as the saying goes,

398
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,839
“A dog won’t hate a poor home,

399
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,759
a child won’t hate an ugly planet.”

400
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,160
For the three of us

401
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,680
who were nurtured there,

402
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,200
it is a great planet,

403
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
a selfless planet.

404
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,759
What?

405
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,440
No, a happy planet.

406
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,480
To us,

407
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:52,960
it

408
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,000
is simply

409
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,680
beyond any language

410
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
that could ever express

411
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,519
our grief for S Planet.

412
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:23,880
I will

413
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,359
sing a song for everyone

414
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,839
to convey

415
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,240
my longing for my home planet.

416
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,759
Beyond the Milky Way,

417
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,480
by a black hole’s edge,

418
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,359
inside Andromeda,

419
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,519
lies my home planet.

420
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,079
Thank you.

421
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,799
That was my wedding ring.

422
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,680
It’s still smoking now.

423
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,880
At the world’s end,

424
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,160
at the edge of the sky,

425
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,160
we remember it together.

426
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,799
You’re welcome to give a gift of cash.

427
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,920
Scan the code or pay in cash.

428
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:40,359
You’re welcome to give a gift of cash.

429
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:45,759
Scan the code or pay in cash.

430
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Scan the code or pay in cash.

431
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,720
Genetic similarity:

432
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,079
95%.

433
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,279
Probability of paternity:

434
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,799
zero point

435
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,920
zero zero zero zero zero

436
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,440
zero one

437
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,480
Holding a funeral is exhausting.

438
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,359
Tell me about it.

439
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,799
But to be fair,

440
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,680
the result was pretty good.

441
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,680
Exactly.

442
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,880
Especially

443
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:01,240
when we burned a whole paper Milky Way.

444
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,160
That little show

445
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,119
was really fun.

446
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,839
Your eulogy was nice too.

447
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,799
You hardly ever praise me.

448
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,119
Then let me praise you too.

449
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,599
You sang really well today.

450
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,039
And I noticed when you were singing,

451
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,279
there was a tear in your eye.

452
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,640
You were truly sad.

453
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,400
Right?

454
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,200
No.

455
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,680
It’s just that

456
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,599
I still have savings back home.

457
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,960
Some people, honestly,

458
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,160
fall for it and won’t admit it…

459
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,160
Dad.

460
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,319
Dad.

461
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,119
What’s wrong, Dad?

462
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,599
Nothing.

463
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,079
I just suddenly

464
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,440
felt like writing a song.

465
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,240
What song?

466
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,640
You’re crying writing it.

467
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,200
It’s called

468
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,960
Zero point.

469
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Zero zero, zero zero, zero zero,

470
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,400
zero one kind of love.

471
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,599
That love sounds pretty weak.

472
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,799
Weak?

473
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,000
At zero point,

474
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,880
zero zero, zero zero,

475
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,720
with so many zeros,

476
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,039
isn’t that basically nothing?

477
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,920
Dad, don’t cry.

478
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,680
What’s going on?

479
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,119
Whose love is this about?

480
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:21,640
It’s… it’s…

481
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,160
I said the wrong thing, Dad.

482
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,799
I said it wrong.

483
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,000
Please don’t cry, Dad.

484
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,960
Stop crying.

485
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,119
What’s wrong with Dad?

486
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:30,640
Don’t listen.

487
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,160
Come here, look.

488
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,319
Dad is crying.

489
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,839
Dad.

490
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:36,519
What’s wrong?

491
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:36,960
Dad…

492
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,720
No, no, no.

493
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,279
Don’t say that word.

494
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,039
Dad.

495
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,160
Which word, Dad?

496
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,599
I don’t know.

497
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,160
Don’t say “Dad.”

498
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,119
The more you call me Dad,

499
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,559
the more it hurts inside.

500
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,119
Don’t say that word.

501
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,079
Dad, why does it hurt

502
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,359
when I call you Dad?

503
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,000
I’m going out for a walk.

504
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,039
I’m going out for a walk.

505
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:50,759
I’m going out for a walk.

506
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:51,200
Dad.

507
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:53,559
Dad.

508
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,599
Why, Dad?

509
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,079
Dad, why can’t I call you Dad?

510
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,039
Stop that.

511
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,680
What are you doing?

512
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,559
How do you know the cu… cuckoo?

513
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,720
It is really darn it.

514
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,599
It lays its eggs in magpie nests,

515
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,400
and makes the magpies

516
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,079
raise its babies for it.

517
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,240
Darn it.

518
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,240
Are you crazy?

519
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,759
The magpies don’t even care.

520
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,920
Why do you care so much?

521
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Who says magpies don’t care?

522
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,119
They just don’t know

523
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,519
how the magpies feel.

524
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,559
Do you really get

525
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,279
the magpies’ pain?

526
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,400
Do you truly understand?

527
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Do you?

528
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,039
Do you get your phone is ringing?

529
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,559
Old Meng,

530
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,839
this is Liu Jie.

531
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,880
My grandson killed those two goldfish fast.

532
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,599
Got any longer‑lived animals?

533
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,119
Like you, Old Meng—

534
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,440
a turtle.

535
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,559
No, no, absolutely not.

536
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,640
What do you need?

537
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,279
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

538
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,559
In-law,

539
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,880
you’re still not asleep?

540
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:32,039
Who says you must sleep at night?

541
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,319
You’re not sleeping either.

542
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,119
I…

543
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,359
I just…

544
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:44,920
can’t fall asleep.

545
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,759
What’s wrong?

546
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,519
Well…

547
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,920
I’ve run into a bit of

548
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,119
a small setback.

549
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,720
Tell me about it.

550
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,799
You seem worried too.

551
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,200
How about you go first?

552
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,240
My past is gone.

553
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,799
I’m about the same as you.

554
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,079
My future is gone.

555
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,720
Meng Hang.

556
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
Why is Dad so weird today?

557
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,200
Yeah.

558
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,240
I don’t know why either.

559
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,759
I just remembered something.

560
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,799
Li Cai told me today

561
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,559
Dad went to the hospital for

562
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,839
some test results.

563
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,000
Could it be those results?

564
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:42,720
Dad.

565
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,880
What’s wrong with you?

566
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You’re acting really strange.

567
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,799
No, no.

568
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,519
I just…

569
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,839
I suddenly had a realization.

570
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,519
It’s that…

571
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,240
The times you call me “Dad”

572
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,720
are all set by fate.

573
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,799
Each time you call, there’s one less.

574
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,960
In-law,

575
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,880
we used to meet and

576
00:27:59,039 --> 00:27:59,920
always end up arguing.

577
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,000
Today I feel like I woke up.

578
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,640
Life’s like flowers in a mirror,

579
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,519
ever-changing, unpredictable.

580
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,440
What matters most

581
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,119
is to cherish the present.

582
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,279
I won’t argue with you today.

583
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,720
Come on.

584
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,240
From now on,

585
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,599
no matter my mood, good or bad,

586
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,720
I’ll always speak nicely to you.

587
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,920
I’ll also try not to snap at you.

588
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,680
Mom.

589
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,119
Dad.

590
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,799
You two…

591
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:45,839
what are you doing?

592
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,240
We are…

593
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:50,680
No, no,

594
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,960
it’s just purely

595
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:52,920
revolutionary friendship.

596
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,559
Right.

597
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,160
Dad, be honest with me.

598
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,480
Did you go to the hospital today?

599
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,039
How did you know?

600
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,839
I heard it from Li Cai.

601
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,160
Li Cai heard it from Old Wang.

602
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,000
Old Wang heard it from Aunt Li.

603
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,440
Aunt Li heard it from her niece

604
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,880
who works at the hospital.

605
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,400
Just tell me,

606
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
are the results not very good?

607
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,240
It’s okay.

608
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,480
The bar’s mourning hall is still up.

609
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:31,920
Mom.

610
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,240
Why didn’t you tell me?

611
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,000
I was afraid if I told you,

612
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,960
you’d stop seeing me as your dad.

613
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,319
Nonsense.

614
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,759
I’m your flesh and blood, your own son.

615
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,720
Dad.

616
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,440
What on earth is going on?

617
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,359
If the results aren’t good,

618
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,160
we’ll figure it out together.

619
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,920
Whatever it is,

620
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,079
we’ll face it together.

621
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,160
Okay, I’ll tell you.

622
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,279
So, I…

623
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,960
I did a DNA test

624
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,920
for paternity with Hanghang.

625
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,400
The genetic test says

626
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,160
Hanghang and I

627
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,640
are not biologically father and son.

628
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,200
What?

629
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,960
You keep eating GMO stuff.

630
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,359
Your genes must’ve flipped.

631
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,119
Stop making things worse.

632
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,000
Ninety‑five percent.

633
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,640
That shouldn’t be right.

634
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,839
Humans and gorillas’ genes

635
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,079
are 99 percent alike.

636
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,920
See?

637
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,839
Told you Old Meng’s worse than a beast.

638
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,160
Can you talk properly?

639
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,279
Dad, there’s definitely something off.

640
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,519
Yeah, yeah.

641
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:09,960
Something’s definitely wrong.

642
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:11,960
Dad.

644
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,720
Dad.

645
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,519
Dad.

646
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:14,680
Here.

647
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,279
Look.

648
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,880
Look how alike we two look.

649
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,119
How could we not be real father and son?

650
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,559
I’m not even half as paranoid as you.

651
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,640
Can you calm down already?

652
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,400
Hanghang.

653
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:27,880
Don’t comfort me.

654
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,559
Don’t comfort me.

655
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,119
It’s okay.

656
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,559
If you still see me as dad,

657
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:31,920
then we’re still

658
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,640
family.

659
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,400
If you don’t,

660
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,799
and want to find your real dad,

661
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,359
I won’t object.

662
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,039
Your biological dad is Zhiqiang.

663
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,720
If you want to “leave darkness for light,”

664
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,519
it’s okay.

665
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,200
You can go.

666
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,720
From then on, call me Uncle.

667
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,119
I’ll hold back my tears.

668
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,960
You two, stop crying.

669
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,200
There’s definitely an issue with this test.

670
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,440
You two, give me one more hair each.

671
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,160
I’ll redo it.

672
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,519
Trust science.

673
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,240
Trust what science?

674
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,480
This agency’s definitely fake.

675
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,079
This agency…

676
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:04,759
Stop crying.

677
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,200
Who’s Zhiqiang?

678
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,000
Is this necessary?

679
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,160
Is it worth wasting money on this?

680
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,559
You—

681
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,279
If you’ve got that money,

682
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,640
let Hanghang go join that

683
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,920
TV show “Waiting for You.”

684
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:27,880
To look for his

685
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,839
real dad.

686
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,160
Wouldn’t that

687
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,000
be much better?

688
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,480
Dad.

689
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,400
How is that not necessary?

690
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,359
This time we went to

691
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,759
the city’s most authoritative

692
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,160
professional testing center.

693
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
It’s guaranteed more accurate.

694
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,960
The results will be here soon.

695
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,559
They’re here.

696
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,920
No, I…

697
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
I’m a bit nervous, I…

698
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,559
I can’t press it.

699
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,839
You do it.

700
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,880
I’m not looking.

701
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:03,960
Whatever the result,

702
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,640
it can’t change

703
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,039
the fact I’m my dad’s son.

704
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,480
No, no.

705
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,640
Hanghang, you must trust science.

706
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,599
You do it.

707
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,200
I, I…

708
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,279
Fine, I’ll do it.

709
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,559
I can’t do it.

710
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
Look how spineless you are.

711
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,079
I’ll do it.

712
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,160
Honestly…

713
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,480
I told you,

714
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,400
you two don’t look alike at all.

715
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,559
Turns out you are blood‑related.

716
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,480
Dad’s smiling.

717
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,519
He fell asleep.

718
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,599
Dad.

719
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,760
What’s wrong?

720
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,519
Dad.

721
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:16,599
Dad.

722
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,199
Chief Editor.

723
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:40,719
What’s wrong?

724
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,599
Why’s our signal so good today?

725
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,559
Hold on a second.

726
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,679
I’ll connect the video signal.

727
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:52,960
Chief Editor

728
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
What’s going on?

729
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:54,880
You…

730
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,920
You, the last couple days, you—

731
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,719
where did you disappear to?

732
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,480
Why couldn’t I reach you?

733
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,079
There was a stellar magnetic storm.

734
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,199
It knocked out signals planet‑wide.

735
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,440
It even burned out several satellites.

736
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,079
Our unit went on a group vacation.

737
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:04,840
They just fixed it.

738
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:05,360
No, that’s not it.

739
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,800
I came back to tons of messages from you.

740
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,559
What did you need?

741
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,119
You know…

742
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,719
well…

743
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,880
it’s nothing.

744
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,639
As long as you’re fine,

745
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,440
my sky is clear.

746
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,800
A thunderbolt.

747
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,880
To my mom, that’s a thunderbolt.

748
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:27,599
Mom,

749
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,199
I’ve got good news for you

750
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,239
and some bad news.

751
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,360
Good news: our home planet didn’t blow up.

752
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,199
Bad news is,

753
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,920
you have to return all the gift money.

754
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,400
Wait, no—

755
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,519
so is that good or bad then?

756
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,039
Li Lili.

757
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,480
Li—

758
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,719
Let me share a secret.

759
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,199
At the funeral, my mom

760
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,119
waited till I wasn’t looking

761
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,800
and secretly wiped away a tear.

762
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,079
I accidentally saw her do it.

763
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:51,400
What does that mean?

764
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,159
Deep down inside,

765
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,199
she’s actually soft‑hearted.

766
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,320
For a moment I even felt guilty.

767
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,760
Before this, I

768
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,320
actually thought she was cruel.

769
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,159
Li Lili.

770
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:01,679
About your card…

771
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,760
I bought just a few things,

772
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,679
and it maxed out.

773
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,760
You’re way too broke.

774
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,719
So my old view of her was right.

775
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:12,920
I’m sure of it.
