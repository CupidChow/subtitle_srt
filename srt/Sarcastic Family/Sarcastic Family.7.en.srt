1
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,200
Heaven rewards those who persevere.

2
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,400
After all these years,

3
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,200
you've been hiding here all along.

4
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,920
Who are you?

5
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,159
What do you want?

6
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Why is your neck so stiff?

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
This ability is getting harder to control.

8
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,759
Why is it lagging now?

9
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,919
I never expected

10
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,479
all three of us would end up on Earth.

11
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,280
Speak.

12
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,879
Why did you run away twenty years ago?

13
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,919
Why do you sound so hoarse?

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,800
Say it.

15
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,520
What are you trying to do?

16
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,879
Say what?

17
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,159
Speak.

18
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,639
What am I supposed to say?

19
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,560
You should ask me first.

20
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,879
Playing dumb, huh?

21
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,719
Up to your old tricks again?

22
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,919
I’m not scheming anything.

23
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,080
All I have now is a crooked neck.

24
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,919
How did I get a stiff neck from running?

25
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,599
I take such good care of myself,

26
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,479
this shouldn’t happen.

27
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,280
Earthling.

28
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,639
You’ve got the wrong person.

29
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,319
Then why are you running?

30
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,560
I suddenly remembered

31
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,759
I have to walk someone’s dog tonight.

32
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,120
That dog’s mating howl

33
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,719
sounds a lot like your raspy voice.

34
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,479
Such a normal kid,

35
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,879
why do you have to keep your mouth open?

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,080
It can move now.

37
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,199
It’s too noisy.

38
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,560
I didn’t say anything.

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,800
The splashing in your head is too loud.

40
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,560
Let’s go, quickly.

41
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,080
Wait a second.

42
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,479
I have a quick question.

43
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,439
You’re an alien.

44
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,680
The person you’re looking for isn’t my dad,

45
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,879
Li Bu Zai, right?

46
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,240
So plain.

47
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,600
Do you even need to test that?

48
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,560
This kid is so uncool.

49
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,199
First time seeing plus and minus together.

50
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,240
Means he’s both an Earthling

51
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,439
and an alien.

52
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,199
That’s right.

53
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,199
Since you’ve figured it out,

54
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,920
I’ll kindly tell you,

55
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,720
I am the handsome and charming,

56
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,759
adorable and captivating,

57
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,160
one and only in the universe,

58
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,560
Mixed-blood Prince with dual genes,

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,480
Li Cai.

60
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,639
Let’s play a “would you rather” game.

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,680
How do we play?

62
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:54,959
Listen up.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,879
Say it.

64
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,199
Ten centimeters taller

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,040
or ten kilograms lighter—which one?

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,560
I’d pick ten kilograms lighter.

67
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,079
Why?

68
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,199
If I were ten centimeters taller, I’d be taller than you.

69
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,879
I’d be one seventy-eight too.

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,399
Aren’t you one seventy-four?

71
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,040
With shoes, I’m one seventy-eight.

72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,240
Men—

73
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,560
talk about salary before tax,

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,560
height after putting on shoes.

75
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,800
Alright.

76
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,959
I’ll give you one too.

77
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,199
If baldness is your fate,

78
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,639
would you choose to be bald in front or back?

79
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,399
Bald in front.

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,959
Why?

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,839
It has to be the front.

82
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,759
At least I can say I’m

83
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
flat in front, round in back,

84
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,680
built for greatness,

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,759
a handsome guy.

86
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,160
Pick one:

87
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,040
my face

88
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,000
with Daniel Wu’s body,

89
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,959
or Daniel Wu’s face with my body—

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,839
which do you choose?

91
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,879
That’s a tough choice.

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,879
Hard to pick.

93
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,480
I prefer the original.

94
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,439
You’re smooth with words.

95
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,759
Of course.

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,399
Daniel Wu’s perfection can’t be split.

97
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,480
I have another one.

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,360
I’m a globally wanted criminal

99
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,639
or I’m an alien—which one?

100
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,399
Wanted criminal.

101
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,120
Why?

102
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,639
Then I can take you on the run worldwide.

103
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,399
On the run around the world.

104
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,240
Go out the window.

105
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,720
Wanted criminal and accomplice spotted.

106
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,560
A man,

107
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,920
about one seventy-four tall,

108
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
one seventy-eight.

109
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,639
With shoes.

110
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,120
One seventy-eight.

111
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,000
What if I’m an alien?

112
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,120
No way.

113
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,480
Why not?

114
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,120
Well,

115
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:13,800
um,

116
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,519
Alien,

117
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,079
and Cloverfield,

118
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,839
you haven’t seen District 9, right?

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,920
The aliens in those movies

120
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,319
are gross

121
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,480
and scary.

122
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,759
I’m telling you,

123
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,639
if you make me choose between

124
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,639
alien

125
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,439
and wanted criminal,

126
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,879
it means you don’t understand aliens at all.

127
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,920
And you

128
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,680
probably don’t know me either.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,920
When I was little,

130
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,839
I loved studying

131
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,720
extraterrestrial civilizations

132
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,600
and aliens.

133
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,519
But later,

134
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,600
the more I learned,

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,360
the more I realized

136
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,120
just

137
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,480
how terrifying it is.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,040
I’m conservative.

139
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,800
I don’t recommend

140
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,240
Close encounter of the third kind.

141
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,279
So you're saying

142
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,319
after your mom passed away,

143
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,199
your dad disappeared again.

144
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,720
Just one year ago.

145
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,000
I couldn't find him anywhere.

146
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,600
He kept moving from place to place.

147
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,279
People like him have a name on Earth.

148
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,439
Scumbag.

149
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,879
At my dad's age,

150
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
he's not dead, is he?

151
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,879
For an alien like my dad,

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
what happens when he dies?

153
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,439
Dead scumbag.

154
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,199
But unfortunately,

155
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,040
he can't die.

156
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Because our lifespan

157
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,120
is three times longer

158
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,320
than humans'.

159
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,120
How did you learn about your origins?

160
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,080
My dad left me a letter before he left.

161
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,559
I carry it with me.

162
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,000
It's pretty thick.

163
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,320
Looks like

164
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,159
he had a lot to say to you.

165
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,440
Son,

166
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm leaving.

167
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,240
By the way,

168
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,399
I'm an alien.

169
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,519
You're mixed-blood.

170
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,679
That's it.

171
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,399
That's all?

172
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,120
You believed it?

173
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,759
I did.

174
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,360
No wonder

175
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,840
people always said I was weird.

176
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,120
I have to be weird.

177
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,240
I'm half alien, half human.

178
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,639
Um,

179
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:13,960
your dad—

180
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,559
what did he say about me?

181
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,639
He never mentioned you.

182
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,720
Bastard.

183
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,440
You hate my dad.

184
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,840
Hate is love.

185
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,240
Means you loved him deeply.

186
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Pah, nonsense!

187
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
On our home planet, we don't need feelings.

188
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,840
Everything is matched by big data.

189
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,960
We used an artificial womb

190
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,879
to create a little girl.

191
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,159
We signed a contract

192
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,679
to raise her until she was five

193
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,759
then hand her to the government.

194
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,440
But in the third year,

195
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,639
your dad vanished.

196
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,559
He took all my money, too.

197
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,080
Isn't that outrageous?

198
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,000
Way too much.

199
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,799
I have a half-sister.

200
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,080
My dad never told me.

201
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,799
That's not the point.

202
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,759
The point is he broke the contract.

203
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,519
Your dad—

204
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,480
did he leave you anything

205
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,840
valuable?

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,679
Of course.

207
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,960
My dad left me a fortune.

208
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,960
There's a saying on Earth:

209
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
"The son pays the father's debt."

210
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,080
So the money he owes me,

211
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
you pay it back.

212
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,360
I will.

213
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,200
The Ferrari last time—

214
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,279
did it drive well?

215
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,600
If you're free, come get the Lamborghini.

216
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,120
I have to go now.

217
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

218
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,000
When you pick me up tomorrow,

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
will it be the Lamborghini?

220
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,039
Absolutely.

221
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,000
Lamborghini.

222
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,320
Goes perfectly with my dear Cai Yi.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,399
Let's say, for example,

224
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,360
aliens really came to Earth.

225
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,639
They want to interact with you.

226
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,360
As Earth's representative,

227
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,279
could you have a friendly meeting?

228
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,399
No.

229
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,559
I guess

230
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,279
real aliens must look terrifying,

231
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,080
be violent,

232
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,039
and can't communicate with humans.

233
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,399
Well,

234
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,639
what you're doing

235
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,000
is stereotyping aliens.

236
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,600
What if some can communicate?

237
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,039
Then my answer is

238
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,679
a famous quote from "The Three-Body Problem":

239
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,440
Don't answer.

240
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,519
Don't answer.

241
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,039
Don't answer.

242
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,240
No, I mean, what if—

243
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,559
just in case,

244
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,879
you spend time with this alien,

245
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,279
and find she's actually nice?

246
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,879
Different species.

247
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,080
Can't coexist.

248
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,879
Too cramped.

249
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,600
Even the bathroom's too small.

250
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,240
Can't live together.

251
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
Lili, hurry up!

252
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,080
Meng already drew the map.

253
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,399
I—I...

254
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,039
Don't get me wrong, don't misunderstand.

255
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,759
Don't get me wrong, I—

256
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,519
You're heading out so early?

257
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,600
Today is a good day.

258
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,519
Everything you wish for will come true.

259
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,440
Today and tomorrow are both good days.

260
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,440
Cai Yi.

261
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,600
Over here.

262
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
This time,

263
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,000
we've struck it rich.

264
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,200
Your dad's doing pretty well on Earth.

265
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,080
What does he do?

266
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,799
He's an experientialist.

267
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,480
He does a bit of everything.

268
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,519
Oh, right.

269
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,720
What did he do on the home planet?

270
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
He was

271
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,440
in charge of maintaining asteroids
around the home planet.

272
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,879
The cooling system.

273
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,679
He was a technician for the
entropy reduction effect.

274
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,879
That's impressive.

275
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,399
But on Earth, he's just an AC repairman.

276
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,039
So why did he leave the home planet?

277
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,399
On our home planet,

278
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
one in a thousand people have

279
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,360
a genetic defect.

280
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,799
That means they

281
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,279
are born with a

282
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,519
chaotic, useless mechanism.

283
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,279
It's

284
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,159
love.

285
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,360
Just saying it makes me sick.

286
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,919
You mean

287
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
you don't need love?

288
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,080
Of course not.

289
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,000
What's the point of that stuff?

290
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
But your dad hid it pretty well.

291
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,799
I never noticed.

292
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,960
He slipped up after he had a daughter.

293
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,200
Maybe he was afraid the government
would find out.

294
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
So he ran away.

295
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,240
Let's go.

296
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,159
Let's take a walk.

297
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,000
Where do you want to go?

298
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,200
Where do you live?

299
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,919
Is this your place?

300
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,360
Get me some shoe covers.

301
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:58,919
It's fine.

302
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,720
I'm not worried about your dirt.

303
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm worried about my shoes getting dirty.

304
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:03,960
Well,

305
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,159
Here.

306
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:14,679
They're mismatched.

307
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,639
You must be loaded.

308
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,399
You even have a room

309
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,080
just for piling up trash.

310
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,320
Please, have a seat.

311
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,039
I'll just stand.

312
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,840
Alright.

313
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm not greedy either.

314
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,440
Just give me the Lamborghini.

315
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,679
Then we're even.

316
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,879
That's not my car.

317
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,159
It's my rich friend's.

318
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,159
He has too many cars to drive.

319
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,200
He's worried some cars get lonely
and neglected.

320
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,840
So he hires me to walk his cars.

321
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,320
That's your job?

322
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,279
Not entirely.

323
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,279
The senior college pays me to walk wheelchairs.

324
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,399
I'm just like my dad,

325
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,639
an experientialist too.

326
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,559
Enough nonsense.

327
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,159
Didn't you say your dad left you a fortune?

328
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,120
Hand it over.

329
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,080
Alright.

330
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,639
Here it is.

331
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,799
The only fortune my dad left me

332
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:16,879
is me.

333
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,759
Darn it.

334
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,759
I officially present myself to you.

335
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,679
Since you're new to Earth,

336
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,960
I'm your local guide.

337
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:24,759
Starting today,

338
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,799
I'll stay with you till the very end.

339
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,399
You're not a fortune.

340
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,039
You're bad debt.

341
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,080
Auntie, don't go!

342
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,399
Don't you want your fortune?

343
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,960
Can you give me back the shoe covers?

344
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,679
Can you stop following me?

345
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,440
You're so noisy.

346
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,519
I didn't even say anything.

347
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,080
Can't you hear how poor you sound?

348
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,080
I am poor,

349
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,919
but I can earn money.

350
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,480
I made one hundred today walking cars.

351
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,840
Got a two hundred fine.

352
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,919
Lend me one hundred first.

353
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,480
So basically,

354
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,039
if I were an alien,

355
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,559
you wouldn't like me either?

356
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,559
But you're not.

357
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,840
What if I was?

358
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,120
Are you?

359
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm not.

360
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,559
Why do you have to link everything
to aliens?

361
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,000
Let me put it this way.

362
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,480
If you were an alien,

363
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,399
in your world,

364
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,480
I'd be an alien too.

365
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,639
So,

366
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,120
two outsiders in each other's eyes,

367
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,600
why force them together?

368
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,200
I'm just an ordinary guy

369
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,759
looking for an ordinary girl

370
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,440
to fall in love,

371
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,320
get married,

372
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,559
and live a normal life.

373
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,840
Is there anything wrong

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,840
with thinking like that?

375
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,519
Isn't it just a wild idea?

376
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,759
Why take it so seriously?

377
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,880
I just want someone

378
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,799
who can accept me,
even if I'm different.

379
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,319
Someone who can accept me.

380
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,039
You can't leave today.

381
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,319
You have to explain yourself today.

382
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:33,799
I have to go.

383
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,839
How many times have I told you?

384
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,160
I just...

385
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,640
No.

386
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Why can't you understand?

387
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,839
No matter what you say,
you can't leave today.

388
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,200
I've been looking for you for days.

389
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,960
How many times have I told you?

390
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,319
Where did you go?

391
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:40,880
Alright, ma'am.

392
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,720
If you're going to be like this,

393
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:42,799
then I have to run.

394
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,720
Stop right there!

395
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,279
You dog scoundrel!

396
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:46,839
Stop!

397
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,119
You dog scoundrel!

398
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,119
Stop right there!

399
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,680
You...

400
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,200
Where do you think you're running?

401
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:54,839
Aunt Hua.

402
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:55,880
Are you alright?

403
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,839
What's wrong with this guy?

404
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:57,720
Ask him.

405
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,319
It's his doing.

406
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,079
He even has a kid now.

407
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:01,799
Tell me,

408
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,079
how will you compensate me?

409
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
What's a kid?

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Compensate for what?

411
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,440
This is beautiful love.

412
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,319
Then you two go ahead and talk.

413
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,440
I can't handle this.

414
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,119
Lili

415
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,119
It's not me.

416
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,519
It's my girl.

417
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,359
My girl, yeah.

418
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,079
Then I can't help either.

419
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,039
My girl is a

420
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,839
bred-in-UK

421
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,000
purebred imported Border Collie.

422
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,440
I paid money

423
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:33,720
to have him walk her for me.

424
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:34,559
But what happened?

425
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,799
He let my girl

426
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,640
get with a stray mutt.

427
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,759
You know, did that.

428
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,720
Now she had a litter of mixes.

429
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:43,880
What's wrong with mixes?

430
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,759
Mixes are the smartest.

431
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,880
Auntie, let me be honest with you.

432
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:46,839
I'm a mix myself.

433
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,839
If you use yourself as proof,

434
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,759
that doesn't help your argument.

435
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
You just don't get it.

436
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,119
I can sense animals' emotions.

437
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,720
I clearly felt

438
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,920
her girl and that mutt

439
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
are truly in love.

440
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,119
I'm just helping

441
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,240
a beautiful dog romance.

442
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,720
Beautiful, my ass!

443
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:04,839
My girl

444
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,839
was supposed to mate with a purebred

445
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,799
Border Collie.

446
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,039
Now look what happened.

447
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,359
She's totally lost her value.

448
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,039
You have to compensate me.

449
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:14,960
Auntie,

450
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,920
bloodline,

451
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,039
breed, species, group—

452
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,039
they're just ignorant, silly labels

453
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,119
that humans stick on things.

454
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,680
At its core,

455
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,200
it's just two loving souls

456
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,599
in the vast universe

457
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,599
forming quantum entanglement of feelings and desire.

458
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,200
That makes sense.

459
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,000
Right?

460
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,480
Actually, we humans

461
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,359
are the same.

462
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,359
All our lives,

463
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,279
everything we do

464
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,119
is just to

465
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,880
find that

466
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,599
person who resonates with us.

467
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,440
Isn't that right?

468
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,440
Yes.

469
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,880
So isn't that beautiful?

470
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,039
It is.

471
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,400
So I don't have to pay, right?

472
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,640
Just pay up already,

473
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,000
and be done with it.

474
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,000
Thanks.

475
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,200
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

476
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,559
About this matter,

477
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,920
I won't press it anymore.

478
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,359
So tell me,

479
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,519
what about this litter of mixes?

480
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,400
How about this—

481
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,519
bring them to my dad's pet shop tomorrow.

482
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,960
I'll help you find

483
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:09,920
people to adopt them.

484
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,680
You promise?

485
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,039
Thank you.

486
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,200
The kindness of strangers

487
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,440
always moves me.

488
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,759
I'm Li Cai.

489
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,799
As for you,

490
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:25,839
I'm definitely making you my friend.

491
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,920
No problem.

492
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,000
Normally,

493
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,519
I wouldn't bother with this stuff.

494
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,559
But today just hit my emotional spot.

495
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Let's add each other on WeChat.

496
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,440
I'll scan your code.

497
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Can I ask you about someone?

498
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,400
Do you know an auntie

499
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,519
with a bit of a temper,

500
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,519
kind of edgy,

501
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,519
with a bird on her clothes,

502
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,720
and a bit of good looks?

503
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,079
A bird on her clothes?

504
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,720
If it's about a bird,

505
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,000
I do remember someone.

506
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,000
What did she do to you?

507
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,000
She's my dad's ex-wife.

508
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,839
She's your dad's ex-wife?

509
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,880
No way, you must be mistaken.

510
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:08,680
Really.

511
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,920
Let me tell you a secret.

512
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,160
This secret—

513
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:11,960
I don't tell just anyone.

514
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:12,839
But I'll tell you.

515
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:13,680
My dad

516
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,480
is an alien.

517
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Your dad is an alien?

518
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,640
And the person you mentioned

519
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
is your dad's ex-wife?

520
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,119
You're my mom's ex-husband's son?

521
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,319
So you're my...

522
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,720
brother.

523
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,640
Brother.

524
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,480
What a lousy day, right?

525
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,160
Mom, mom, mom!

526
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,440
I want to talk to you about something.

527
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:01,960
Go ahead.

528
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,559
Well...

529
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,960
I think Lili

530
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:06,960
was a bit

531
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,960
strange today.

532
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,880
She's always been strange.

533
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,920
Is this news to you?

534
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,319
Yeah.

535
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,519
She's always been strange.

536
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,839
Isn't that why you like her?

537
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,480
Otherwise, how would you two be together?

538
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,240
If, say,

539
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,640
her appearance changed,

540
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,799
I mean,

541
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,480
she became unrecognizable,

542
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,359
not even looking human anymore,

543
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:36,319
what then?

544
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Would you still be into that?

545
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,839
What are you talking about?

546
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,039
Even if Lili turned back into an alien,

547
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,599
she'd still be the same.

548
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,839
She is who she is.

549
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,759
I'm not saying she's an alien.

550
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,039
I'm just making a point.

551
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,720
Just...

552
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
if she were an alien,

553
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,400
if she wasn't from Earth,

554
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,359
she would...

555
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
I can't talk about this anymore.

556
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,960
I need to go to the bar and ask around.

557
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,759
Didn't you just get back?

558
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Her weirdness is inherited.

559
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,960
Come down.

560
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,519
Come down.

561
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,799
I mean you, come down.

562
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,160
You have to come down too.

563
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,720
Honestly, I've always wanted a sister.

564
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,720
I never thought

565
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:37,960
I'd have a younger brother.

566
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,279
Oh wow, I finally have family.

567
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,720
Don't you have a mom?

568
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,839
My mom and I

569
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,880
don't really have feelings.

570
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,440
Back on our home planet,

571
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,519
the government gives out a parenting manual.

572
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,680
Moms just follow the instructions

573
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,559
step by step

574
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,359
to raise their kids, that's it.

575
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,319
No need to show any emotion.

576
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,400
So before I came to Earth,

577
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,440
"Mom"

578
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,319
was just a code name to me.

579
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,160
Just a title.

580
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,359
Like this cup,

581
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,279
this chair,

582
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,480
and that bald guy.

583
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,680
No difference at all.

584
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,799
Oh wow.

585
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,839
So our home planet is all about restraint.

586
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,440
That's so cool.

587
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,839
Now I finally get

588
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,039
why I'm not normal.

589
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,000
I must take after Dad too much.

590
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,240
That's why I don't fit in on Earth.

591
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,039
You're overthinking it.

592
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,079
Dad didn't fit in on the home planet

593
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,079
so he came to Earth.

594
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,319
In a way,

595
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,960
he's more like an Earthling.

596
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,000
I wonder

597
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,960
when he came here,

598
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,480
if he was as confused as I am.

599
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,599
An outcast on the home planet,

600
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,920
a stranger on Earth too.

601
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,599
This kind of loneliness—

602
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,279
have you ever felt it?

603
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,759
Not at all.

604
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,279
Because I'm the Mixed-blood Prince.

605
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,559
So I'm a foreigner everywhere.

606
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,839
On Earth,

607
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,240
there are outsiders everywhere.

608
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,359
You have a good attitude.

609
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,680
Learned from Dad.

610
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,400
He said life is long,

611
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,640
happiness matters most.

612
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,960
When Dad left back then,

613
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,200
I was too young.

614
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,599
I barely remember him.

615
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,880
What kind of person was he?

616
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,160
From what I recall,

617
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,599
he loved my mom

618
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,759
but hated bathing.

619
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,680
He loved cooking for me,

620
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,799
but everything he made was burnt.

621
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,319
He had an old bike.

622
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,759
When I was little,

623
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,400
he'd take me to catch dragonflies.

624
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:37,920
I have proof.

625
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,240
Where?

626
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:40,960
In my mouth.

627
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,079
Missing a tooth.

628
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,240
Sounds more like

629
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,559
proof you ate too much candy.

630
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,200
Wrong.

631
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,079
This tooth

632
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,920
was lost when he took me on his bike

633
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,799
and kicked me off the back seat.

634
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,720
I lost it in the fall.

635
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,440
Dad's aim was pretty good.

636
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,000
Oh right,

637
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,839
he talked in his sleep.

638
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,079
In your language.

639
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,119
I recorded it once.

640
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,000
Let me find it for you.

641
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,359
Here.

642
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:49,400
Sis,

643
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,599
what did he actually say?

644
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,119
My name.

645
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,640
This should be

646
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,160
what I look like now.

647
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
He used the name Li Bu Zai.

648
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,799
Help me ask around.

649
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Darn it.

650
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,799
They ran into each other.

651
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,960
Sis, how long have you been listening?

652
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,279
Your phone's out of battery.

653
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,160
Aren't you tired of it?

654
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,039
Why are you getting emotional, sis?

655
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,240
I remember what happened the day Dad left.

656
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,160
What?

657
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,440
That day,

658
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,200
Dad said he'd take me away

659
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,759
to a beautiful, passionate planet.

660
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,559
Once we got there,

661
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,880
we could start a new life.

662
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,480
He meant Earth.

663
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,319
But

664
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,640
right before boarding the ship,

665
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,359
I suddenly thought of my mom.

666
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,400
I thought,

667
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,160
if I left,

668
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,160
I'd never see her again.

669
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,400
She'd lose both me and Dad.

670
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,480
How sad would that be?

671
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,799
So I let go of Dad's hand

672
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,519
and ran home.

673
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,440
That was the last time I saw Dad.

674
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,319
That's so touching, sis.

675
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,079
It's okay.

676
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,720
This kid...

677
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,559
It's okay.

678
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,319
Mom.

679
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,680
This is—

680
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,359
I know.

681
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,000
Auntie.

682
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,599
Do you know the day Dad left you?

683
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,079
I know you don't like me because of him.

684
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,440
But I really want to be part of your lives.

685
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,640
Let me put it this way—

686
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,000
If you don't agree,

687
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,039
I'll cry to death right here.

688
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,319
If he latches onto you,

689
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:24,720
you can't shake him off.

690
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,640
Are you sure

691
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,759
you want this brother?

692
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,400
At least now

693
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,680
I don't feel so alone.

694
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,039
Like I said before—

695
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,920
The son pays the father's debt.

696
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,880
From now on,

697
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,880
the money you earn

698
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,000
you'll hand over a share to me.

699
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,039
Why should I?

700
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,759
My mom accepts you now.

701
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,200
That's what it means.

702
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,440
Alright, alright.

703
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,319
The power's out.

704
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
Probably forgot to pay the bill.

705
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:34,759
Lili.

706
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:37,839
I get it now.

707
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,039
I know why you're upset.

708
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,720
Why?

709
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,440
Because you're not an ordinary girl.

710
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,519
You figured it out.

711
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,400
I...

712
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,079
I'm as ordinary as it gets.

713
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,519
I once said

714
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,079
I wanted to find a normal girl

715
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,079
to fall in love, get married,

716
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,400
and live a regular life.

717
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,880
But today,

718
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,039
I finally realized

719
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,880
I fell for you

720
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,200
precisely because

721
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,400
you're not ordinary.

722
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,160
You're stranger than anyone I've met.

723
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,240
Every day we're together,

724
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,440
you get even stranger.

725
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,039
It's your strangeness

726
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,279
that, to me,

727
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,440
is the most precious kind of charm.

728
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,200
I don't care who you are.

729
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,119
Whether you're a fugitive,

730
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,839
an alien,

731
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,119
or even

732
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,799
a thousand-year-old monster,

733
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,359
you're still yourself.

734
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,799
You're the one

735
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,480
I've always wanted to be with.

736
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,680
Actually, I...

737
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,359
You know if you tell him now

738
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,160
you're really an alien,

739
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,000
he'd probably faint.

740
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,759
I'm not planning to say it.

741
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,839
Actually, I...

742
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,000
am not myself.

743
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,400
Lili.

744
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,079
You've lost weight.

745
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,200
Um...

746
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Actually, I want to introduce you.

747
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,680
This is my brother.

748
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,720
Half-brother.

749
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,119
Brother-in-law.

750
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,799
Brother-in-law.

751
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:51,599
I have a brother-in-law now.

752
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:52,599
Brother-in-law.

753
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,160
What you said just now was touching.

754
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,960
The price of romance

755
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,719
is messy candle wax.

756
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,639
This sofa's pretty comfy.

757
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,280
You're making yourself at home.

758
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,920
Moved in on your first day.

759
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,239
Alright.

760
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,480
I'll make do on the sofa tonight.

761
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,960
Then make do for the night.

762
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,679
It's been ages since my sister and I reunited.

763
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,920
Tonight we need a good talk.

764
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,880
You should get some sleep.

765
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,360
Sis.

766
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,519
Sis.

767
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,239
Even stranger than his sister.

768
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,480
From what I've seen,

769
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:51,599
human eyes nowadays

770
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,920
are just label makers.

771
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,599
They never take the time

772
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,519
to look deeper inside

773
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,159
and truly know someone.

774
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,960
They just stick labels on each other

775
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,000
and sort people into boxes.

776
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,039
Though few are as genuine as me,

777
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,320
and loved by all,

778
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,559
I still hope

779
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,599
people use time

780
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,760
not labels

781
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,760
to get to know each other.

782
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,159
Just like it.

783
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,760
Obedient and cute.

784
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,599
Smart and lively.

785
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,199
But humans,

786
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,119
sometimes...

787
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,039
Alright.

788
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:24,760
Stop picking.
