1
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,240
We've been robbed.

2
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,080
You need to adapt to my brother's habits.

3
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:15,800
His place here…

4
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,360
I just cleaned, one day and it's like this.

5
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:20,960
I came in—

6
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,680
No, I mean—

7
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,919
You go into Li Cai's place

8
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,919
without even saying hi to him.

9
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,759
You just walk straight in.

10
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,919
As the saying goes,

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,759
“Birds of a feather flock together.”

12
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,439
So he and I are family now.

13
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,199
What's wrong with me coming in?

14
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,000
That’s not the literal meaning.

15
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,240
There's another saying:

16
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
“The eldest sister is like a mother.”

17
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,759
I'm practically his mom.

18
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,879
Why would I need to tell him?

19
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,879
You and your mom are the ones

20
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,680
who “flock together,” not us.

21
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,240
Anyway…

22
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,560
you should head to work.

23
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,680
I'll tidy up for him

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,560
and cook something and all that.

25
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,400
This kid…

26
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,560
Right here.

27
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,360
Missing a big seven.

28
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,199
Every time it's a big seven short.

29
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,199
Always stuck right here.

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,840
With one big seven, we'd win.

31
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,759
You think maybe it's because

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,639
you didn’t wash your hands?

33
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,719
Can you not jinx it?

34
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,319
I'm just kidding.

35
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,439
You, be more careful.

36
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,759
You can't quit till the very end.

37
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,360
You know that?

38
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,439
Go on, scratch, scratch again.

39
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,439
What should I scratch?

40
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,120
See, he just—

41
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,199
Is there really a gap?

42
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:33,879
Meng—

43
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,560
New lottery shop at the corner.

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,120
Come over here.

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,120
Two tickets, please.

46
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,400
I don't know how.

47
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,960
What's there to know?

48
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,560
You just scratch it.

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,039
Look at everyone here,

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,560
see how happy they are.

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,080
I won!

52
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,120
Really?

53
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,120
Won twenty.

54
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,000
Nice.

55
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:52,879
See?

56
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,960
Not bad at all.

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
Come on, keep scratching.

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,280
Meng—

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,960
A gentle little scratch,

60
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,840
and your dreams blossom.

61
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:07,879
Little Meng.

62
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,199
Come on, come on, give it here.

63
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,719
Come on, come on.

64
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,919
This round is definitely

65
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,479
it’s gonna—

66
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,759
just be one big seven short.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,040
There's a thief at home.

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,160
How many times now?

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,360
Still not used to sis's sudden concern?

70
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Come eat, quick.

71
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,439
I never cook at home.

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,600
I don't even keep spices.

73
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,879
Now your place has everything.

74
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,439
Hasn't it been a long time

75
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,680
since you ate at home?

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,480
Today, taste your sister's cooking.

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
My sister’s “taste”?

78
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,279
Isn't it usually “mom's taste”?

79
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,199
There's also

80
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,199
“godmother's taste.”

81
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,519
Right now all I can smell

82
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,240
is something burnt.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,279
It's my first time cooking too.

84
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,480
You have no idea, cooking is so hard.

85
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,199
Take this braised chicken, for example.

86
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,279
It says dice the radish and potato.

87
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,480
It took me forever to cut them.

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,639
Just this one chunk

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,360
took ages to chop.

90
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,160
Hurry up and eat.

91
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,079
Sis.

92
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,439
You worked so hard cooking,

93
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,680
I’ve decided you can have it all.

94
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,319
Go ahead, you eat it.

95
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,480
How could that be okay?

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,519
I’m afraid you won’t have enough.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,759
I already ordered delivery.

98
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,560
I still like Godmom’s cooking best.

99
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,079
I’ll eat rice mixed with her dishes.

100
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,399
Dig in.

101
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,759
Sis.

102
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,519
You didn’t put pineapple in this, right?

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,839
Pineapple juice.

104
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,959
I’m allergic to pineapple.

105
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,360
My luck is awful today.

106
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Totally wasted, this.

107
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,639
Didn’t win on a single one.

108
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,399
As the saying goes,

109
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,839
unlucky in gambling,

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,240
means lucky in love.

111
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,000
Manager.

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,040
Today you’ll

113
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,079
definitely have some romance.

114
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,519
There’s a tigress at home.

115
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,079
You’d better pray I hit the jackpot.

116
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,920
No problem.

117
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:17,720
Manager,

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,600
uh…

119
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,439
you said your friend wanted a place.

120
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,639
I picked some listings just for him,

121
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,720
based on what he wanted.

122
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,319
Have a look.

123
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,000
No need.

124
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,920
I just referred Lao Cha to my friend.

125
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,800
Bring me along next time he buys.

126
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,279
Take care.

127
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,240
Give it here.

128
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,279
O-one… ten million.

129
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,800
Damn, ten million!

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,120
Ten million…

131
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,279
Get lost.

132
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,639
Meng Hang!

133
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,839
You shaking like you’ve got Parkinson’s?

134
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,759
Get back to work.

135
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,240
Manager,

136
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,360
take me along next time you buy.

137
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,360
How’s your luck?

138
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,279
Super good.

139
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,240
Let’s scratch together then.

140
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,199
Okay, okay, sure.

141
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,079
It’s a deal.

142
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,439
Sure.

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,480
Take care.

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,279
Okay, thanks.

145
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,839
This customer canceled again.

146
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,639
Sugar‑free made full sugar.

147
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,399
Matcha powder became cilantro bits.

148
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,919
What are you doing?

149
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,399
Sorry, boss.

150
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,960
I had an allergy, my eyes are swollen.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can’t see clearly.

152
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,879
Where’s my Liuwei Dihuang pills?

153
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,720
Boss, these tapioca pearls,

154
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,000
aren’t there too few?

155
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,240
The customer will complain.

156
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,399
Li Cai, those are my Dihuang pills.

157
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,159
Darn it, that’s bad.

158
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,679
Then what about this milk tea?

159
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,720
These ten wrong drinks,

160
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,759
come out of your pay.

161
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,240
What? Then I worked for nothing.

162
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,679
Then go find some big idiot

163
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,279
to buy every single one.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,480
Where am I supposed to find an idiot?

165
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,200
Ten full‑sugar, cilantro milk teas,

166
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,840
with pearls swapped for Liuwei Dihuang.

167
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,480
There could actually be such an idiot?

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,960
That’s amazing.

169
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Thank heavens.

170
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,120
Don’t thank heaven.

171
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,440
Thank your big sister.

172
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,240
Dad,

173
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,039
the milk tea is my treat.

174
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,159
You can even butter up the seniors’ uni,

175
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,639
those aunties without diabetes.

176
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,919
What a good kid.

177
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,759
Look at this kid.

178
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,960
Then look at the mom.

179
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,919
What the hell is this?

180
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,440
What’s wrong?

181
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,679
You’re pregnant.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,720
Li Lili’s

183
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,039
milk tea she bought

184
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,039
is really delicious.

185
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,879
Get one, get one!

186
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,840
Here.

187
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,600
Being nice for no reason

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,600
means there’s a catch.

189
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,559
Why would I scam you?

190
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,919
Forget it if you won’t drink.

191
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,320
This tastes amazing.

192
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,519
It has a special aftertaste.

193
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,440
That aftertaste.

194
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,279
Meng Hang.

195
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:23,879
Help me scratch this.

196
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:27,879
Sure.

197
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,919
They say newbies get lucky.

198
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,759
So satisfying.

199
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,399
Your first try failed too?

200
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,279
Got any more?

201
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,279
Just forget it.

202
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,960
You’re a wiper, huh.

203
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,960
Just waving back and forth.

204
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,279
Dad.

205
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,240
Have you done scratch‑offs?

206
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,559
Yeah, I have.

207
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,759
I’m an old lottery guy.

208
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,320
I quit over ten years ago.

209
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,200
You…

210
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,200
You’re hooked.

211
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,000
I didn’t buy any.

212
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,559
I just watch others scratch.

213
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,440
I’m at most secondhand addicted.

214
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,320
Everyone starts out like that.

215
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,879
At first others are scratching.

216
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,559
They’re over the moon.

217
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,519
You stand there watching.

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,840
That’s called “picking joy.”

219
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,080
Then someone gives you a ticket.

220
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,080
You’re thrilled, scratching away.

221
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,919
That’s called “sharing joy.”

222
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,039
Then you notice

223
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,519
one day you start craving it.

224
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,480
That’s called “wanting joy.”

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,759
Finally, one day

226
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:43,519
you make a move.

227
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,240
You buy your first one.

228
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,240
That’s called “buying joy.”

229
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:45,799
At that point,

230
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,919
it changes in nature.

231
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,799
You’re no longer joy’s master,

232
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,279
but addiction’s slave.

233
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,679
A slave.

234
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,440
Slave.

235
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,120
A slave.

236
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,799
That sounds terrifying.

237
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,840
So how did you quit?

238
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,679
Substitution therapy.

239
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,519
My senior year we had

240
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,720
cucumber, potato, carrot

241
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:06,559
all

242
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,639
peeled by me in the kitchen.

243
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,240
Which stage are you at now?

244
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,399
My hands just itch.

245
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,240
I keep wanting to scratch stuff.

246
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,039
But at home today we don’t

247
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,360
even have cucumbers or potatoes.

248
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,639
Go have some milk tea.

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Take your mind off it.

250
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,080
There’s milk tea too?

251
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,919
How do I scratch that?

252
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,639
Drink it, don’t scratch it.

253
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,399
I’m distracted now.

254
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,639
These days,

255
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,080
I don’t dare let Li Cai

256
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,120
out of my sight at all.

257
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,360
I keep worrying

258
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,320
he’s not eating enough,

259
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,360
his life is hard,

260
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,519
he’s not dressed warm,

261
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,039
and no one helps if he’s in trouble.

262
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,720
I never knew you

263
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,879
were this full of love.

264
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,200
Well, I am his sister.

265
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,080
But I don’t have experience.

266
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,440
I don’t know when

267
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,279
I’ll be a good enough sister.

268
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,200
It’s like scratching lottery tickets.

269
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
One day, you just get there.

270
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
Don’t mention scratch‑offs.

271
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,639
Dad told me

272
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,000
those things are addictive.

273
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,960
With your weak self‑control,

274
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,919
you’d better stay away.

275
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,120
Hey, what’s that supposed to mean?

276
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
How am I weak‑willed?

277
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:47,960
Either way, you’re not allowed.

278
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,399
Fine.

279
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,360
I got it.

280
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,600
But same for you.

281
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,279
From now on you can’t be

282
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,320
cleaning up after Li Cai daily.

283
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,240
As the saying goes,

284
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,759
Give a man a fish

285
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,840
is not as good as teach him.

286
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,600
Can you untie your tongue first?

287
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,000
You know what I mean anyway.

288
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,679
You should let him grow up.

289
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,840
Isn’t that how we grew up?

290
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,440
Wait a second.

291
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,120
Come on.

292
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,039
Explain it in detail.

293
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,080
I’ll learn from you.

294
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,759
When we were kids,

295
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,840
our first life‑choice ritual

296
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,120
was called Zhuazhou.

297
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,200
You’re back.

298
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,000
Sis, I’ve got a question.

299
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,559
How do you even have my key?

300
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,519
You and that huge keychain—

301
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,519
you leave it under the doormat.

302
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,360
What were you thinking?

303
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,720
But I didn’t put it there today.

304
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,840
Yeah, you used the next door mat.

305
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,919
You wouldn’t walk one extra step.

306
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,879
So it’s my fault now.

307
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,480
Come here, I need to talk to you.

308
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,720
About what?

309
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,440
Talk about what?

310
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,039
What’s your dream?

311
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,440
We’re going that big?

312
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,200
I need to fully understand you

313
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,119
so I can actually help you.

314
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,839
I haven’t even planned my lunch,

315
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,880
let alone a life dream.

316
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,599
It’s fine.

317
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,920
I came prepared.

318
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,880
What’s this supposed to mean?

319
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,960
You want me to cook my own lunch?

320
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,839
All you think about is food.

321
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,359
Tie it yourself.

322
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,279
Crawl forward.

323
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,799
Good, keep crawling.

324
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,119
Why does this feel so creepy?

325
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,240
I won’t let this hurt you.

326
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:35,920
And then?

327
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,240
Okay.

328
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:37,880
What is this?

329
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,720
Good, good.

330
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,119
What the heck is this?

331
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,599
Hey, you can’t take that one.

332
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,000
That’s for us—

333
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,799
Sis—

334
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,599
are you making me do Zhuazhou?

335
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What are you taking that for?

336
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,920
Whose is it?

337
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,359
I get it now.

338
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,799
You’re meant to be with animals.

339
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,240
I’ll decide this for you.

340
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,400
You’ll study veterinary medicine.

341
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,880
Get licensed, slide right into a job.

342
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,359
Go work for Meng Hang’s dad.

343
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,599
I can chat with animals,

344
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
but I can’t treat them.

345
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,480
Then be an animal therapist.

346
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,960
Med school can’t save aliens.

347
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:17,640
I’m not studying it.

348
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,799
Yes, you are.

349
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,880
Study hard, then take the exam.

350
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,160
This also has

351
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,920
hundreds of terabytes of videos.

352
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,160
Have a look.

353
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,240
So, joke:

354
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,759
Xu Xian buys Lady White a hat.

355
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,880
Once she puts it on,

356
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,599
she suddenly can’t move.

357
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,480
Question:

358
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,160
what hat is it

359
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,599
that powerful?

360
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,720
Well?

361
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,920
A “snake‑pressing” hat.

362
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,000
A snake‑pressing hat.

363
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,559
This is the funniest joke

364
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,039
I’ve heard this year.

365
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,079
Snake‑pressing hat.

366
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,680
Snake‑pressing hat.

367
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,680
Why aren’t you laughing?

368
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,799
Me?

369
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,000
I’m planning to quit.

370
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,480
Won ¥100,000 on scratch‑offs.

371
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,759
I’m taking a long vacation.

372
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,680
Guys,

373
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,240
good luck.

374
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,519
You really can win.

375
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,000
Lao Cha,

376
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,759
after we eat, let’s scratch another.

377
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,839
Let’s go now.

378
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,279
Go, go, go.

379
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,559
I’m coming too.

380
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,240
Aren’t you studying?

381
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,160
What are you doing here?

382
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,759
Not bad.

383
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,440
You weren’t on your phone, right?

384
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,480
No, I wasn’t.

385
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:27,920
Nice.

386
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,359
This kid’s going places.

387
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,079
This kid…

388
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,240
No money.

389
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,240
Get lost.

390
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,480
Another guy…

391
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,160
Take a guess.

392
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,279
I only boss you around for your own good.

393
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,759
Can you just stop meddling in my life?

394
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,799
I was doing just fine before.

395
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,079
When I had money, I blew it.

396
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,200
When I was broke, I prayed to Buddha.

397
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,440
You even prayed to Buddha?

398
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,880
Burn a few yuan worth of incense,

399
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,039
and wish for millions in return.

400
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,119
You never make things hard for yourself,

401
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,319
you just make it hard on heaven.

402
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,960
Can you stop making things hard for me?

403
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,720
You think I’m making things hard for you?

404
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,119
I’m your big sister.

405
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,400
How could I possibly hurt you?

406
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,880
Sis, you’re getting more and more human.

407
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,039
It’s scaring me.

408
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,319
What’s so good about this to drink?

409
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,440
It’s disgustingly sweet.

410
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,680
Mom.

411
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,319
What’s got you so worried?

412
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,960
You bought lottery tickets.

413
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:44,960
You can even tell that?

414
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,680
The scratch‑off flakes from your ticket

415
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,319
landed all over my hand.

416
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:52,920
Mom…

417
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,599
Just now,

418
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,119
that was the first one I ever bought,

419
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,559
and it’ll also be the last.

420
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,319
Don’t you dare let Li Lili find out.

421
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
I don’t care if she knows or not.

422
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:04,799
I only care about you.

423
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,359
Thanks, Mom.

424
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,839
How much is the hush money?

425
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,079
What’s that thing?

426
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,279
That “last” ticket you mentioned.

427
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,440
I started with a twenty‑yuan one.

428
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,720
Then there were forty‑yuan ones,

429
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,119
fifty‑yuan ones and hundred‑yuan ones.

430
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,079
Th‑that rush is too strong.

431
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,559
I…

432
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,599
I don’t even dare touch them.

433
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,000
What’s fun about those little slips?

434
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,599
My coworker just won 100,000 today.

435
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,279
When he came back,

436
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,799
he told me,

437
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,200
“Get me ten tickets.”

438
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,400
Ten fifty‑yuan ones.

439
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,960
This isn’t enough.

440
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,480
If I win 100,000, dock it from that.

441
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:50,880
Hurry up and go.

442
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,480
Sis, I was wrong.

443
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,759
This is the last one.

444
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,079
Absolutely the last one.

445
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,640
Once I scratch this, I’ll quit.

446
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,039
Look, look.

447
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:40,920
I’ll hit you with a five‑kick combo.

448
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,240
Five…

449
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,640
hit…

450
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,200
combo…

451
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:43,519
sweep kick!

452
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,839
This is my absolute last ticket.

453
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,960
Don’t bother me.

454
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,799
You… you…

455
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,440
Come on, fight!

456
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,440
I’ll jump in and smack you.

457
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,000
I’m telling you,

458
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,839
Okay, okay, okay.

459
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:58,960
Come on, bring it.

460
00:23:59,079 --> 00:23:59,599
This King of Fighters thing—

461
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,319
I’m telling you, KOF ’97,

462
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,400
it’s older than me, but whatever.

463
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,920
I still don’t buy it.

464
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,599
This really, really is my last ticket.

465
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,880
Sis.

466
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,240
Can you please set some boundaries?

467
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,599
I am so done with this.

468
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,039
Been drinking, have you?

469
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,599
You can’t drink while studying.

470
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,440
I mean, can you stop interfering with me?

471
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,640
If I don’t step in,

472
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,960
how will you pass the exam?

473
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,160
Sis, can you come out a sec?

474
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,519
There’s something I want to talk about.

475
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,119
Sis,

476
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,960
just relax, okay?

477
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,759
You don’t need to worry about me.

478
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:14,839
I’m about to “qualify” very soon.

479
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:15,880
Qualify for what?

480
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,599
Clinical depression.

481
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,359
Dad.

482
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,720
Haven’t you quit this for years?

483
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,079
How come you’re scratching again?

484
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,000
Won.

485
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,920
Won, won!

486
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,799
We won one hundred thousand!

487
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,519
One hundred thousand!

488
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,960
What are you talking about?

489
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,920
This is forty‑three, not forty‑eight.

490
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,559
Look.

491
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,000
See?

492
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,680
Dad.

493
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,319
Our eyesight’s this bad now.

494
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,279
Just stop buying these.

495
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,119
I haven’t scratched in ages.

496
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:47,119
My heart and blood pressure shot up.

497
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Don’t be mad, okay?

498
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,599
I’ll never buy them again, alright?

499
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,359
I’m not mad at you.

500
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,640
I just don’t get Li Cai.

501
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,160
Then that’s fine.

502
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,160
He’s got no one to rely on.

503
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,559
I’m his only sister.

504
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,039
I really want him

505
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,519
to feel the warmth of family.

506
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,279
But somehow,

507
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,720
the harder I try,

508
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,359
the more he hates it.

509
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,079
I get it now.

510
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,559
Right now, the two of us

511
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,000
are making the same type of mistake.

512
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,079
What mistake?

513
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,039
Me,

514
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,839
I’m hooked on windfall fantasies.

515
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:39,759
And you,

516
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,720
you’re addicted to being a sister.

517
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,000
Once people get obsessed,

518
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,119
they easily go overboard.

519
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,279
So what do we do?

520
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:51,400
Stay calm about it.

521
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:52,559
Be like me.

522
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,079
From now on, each month

523
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,640
I’ll buy just one scratch card.

524
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,000
Just for fun, that’s all.

525
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,119
Didn’t you just say

526
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,079
you’d never buy them again?

527
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,599
Gotta leave a crack for wealth freedom.

528
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,000
And during this period,

529
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,839
you do absolutely nothing.

530
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,799
Give Li Cai some space.

531
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,359
Later I’ll help smooth things between you.

532
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,400
Can I trust you on that?

533
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,319
You have to.

534
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,559
But on one condition.

535
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,680
During this time

536
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,519
you must respect his boundaries.

537
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,039
I meant you buying only one

538
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,519
scratch card a month.

539
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,400
Deal.

540
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,880
No way.

541
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,079
You really do know me.

542
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,359
Once a week, is that okay?

543
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,440
What I meant was,

544
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,519
I can’t possibly do nothing at all.

545
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,960
Have you already done something?

546
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,160
What did he say?

547
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,039
You wouldn’t let me listen.

548
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,440
Don’t ask.

549
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,200
All words you can’t air on TV.

550
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,119
That kid…

551
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,559
Whe– where did he learn that?

552
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:52,880
From Li Cai.

553
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,759
He was really mad.

554
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,839
He told you, within one week,

555
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,759
don’t bother him again.

556
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,759
Fine.

557
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,519
One week, then one week it is.

558
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,279
It’s only seven days.

559
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,920
One hundred sixty‑eight hours.

560
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,559
Ten thousand and eighty minutes.

561
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:22,799
Darn it.

562
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,319
That’s six more months of potatoes.

563
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,400
How come you’ve got no withdrawal?

564
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
It suddenly clicked for me.

565
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,799
Luck really isn’t my strong suit.

566
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,000
If I had luck, how’d I end up with you?

567
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,119
Didn’t scratch it clean.

568
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,440
When I see half the word “thanks”

569
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,759
on a ticket, I stop scratching.

570
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:03,920
This week,

571
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,799
with my help, your sister

572
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,599
has done some real

573
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:08,559
soul-searching.

574
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:12,559
Um,

575
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,799
the way I acted before

576
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,359
really crossed your boundaries.

577
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,559
It was a bit too much.

578
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,000
Your sister owes you an apology.

579
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,759
I promise I won’t do that again.

580
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,440
Let’s just be like friends.

581
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,240
Really?

582
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,279
Really.

583
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,319
What do you chat about with friends?

584
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:28,799
We can talk about that too.

585
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,440
What I chat about with my friends

586
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
is all complaining about you.

587
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:36,759
Well…

588
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,799
Have you been studying lately?

589
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,519
Yeah.

590
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,799
Good, as long as you have.

591
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,079
Then why’s your book stuck on page three?

592
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:47,960
It’s even covered in dust.

593
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:49,880
How do you know that?

594
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,960
Did you go to my place?

595
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,680
No.

596
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,839
Be honest.

597
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,160
Your room is really dirty.

598
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,599
I have to clean it every day.

599
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:00,400
Wait, what?

600
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,319
I always carry my keys now.

601
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,839
Did you secretly copy my key?

602
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:04,839
No.

603
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:05,799
Tell the truth.

604
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,359
I knew nothing about this.

605
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,079
I only made two spare keys.

606
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,720
One for me, one for your brother-in-law.

607
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:17,759
And also,

608
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,640
that girl you chat with every day,

609
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,680
I read through her Weibo

610
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,319
and everyone she interacts with.

611
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,599
You’re not even a backup.

612
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,160
You’re like backup number three.

613
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,079
You really need to wise up.

614
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,119
Seriously, wake up already.

615
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,759
Weren’t you backing off? Why are you—

616
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,000
Let me tell you a joke.

617
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,720
They say Xu Xian put a hat

618
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,599
on Lady White Snake,

619
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,319
and she couldn’t move.

620
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:38,759
Sis…

621
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,680
I’ve missed you.

622
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,039
Two fledglings, just a month old,

623
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,599
were abandoned in the nest.

624
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,480
A pigeon came bullying them.

625
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,559
Seeing their home invaded,

626
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,119
the timid, cowardly big sister

627
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,599
hid her little brother behind her.

628
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,160
She shouted fiercely at the pigeon.

629
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,039
In the end, under her threats,

630
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:01,920
the pigeon flew off.

631
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,920
I’m saying, get down from there.

632
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,920
Why does this feel so creepy?

633
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,640
I would never hurt you.

634
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:09,039
Okay.

635
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,599
Alright.

636
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,079
What’s this?

637
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
It’s been a long time

638
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,000
since you ate at home, right?

639
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,880
Taste your sister’s cooking today.

640
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,960
There’s this really touching show.

641
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,000
Every time I watch it,

642
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:41,960
it makes me think of us.

643
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:42,799
What show?

644
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,880
It’s about siblings Peppa and George,

645
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,839
they’re so much like us.

646
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,240
Really?

647
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:49,759
Yeah.

648
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,039
How are we alike?

649
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,039
Your skin is just like theirs.

650
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,000
All pink and chubby.

651
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,559
Is it?

652
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,279
Hey, little bro,

653
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,359
I promise you this:

654
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,519
from now on I’ll try

655
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,279
not to cross your boundaries.

656
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,680
But you know,

657
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,680
since I am your own sister,

658
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,559
can I have just a tiny privilege,

659
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,480
to sometimes cross that line

660
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,039
and come a bit closer to you?

661
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,119
Sis, cross my lines all you want.

662
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,200
In front of you

663
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,200
I can have no upper limit,

664
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,319
and no bottom line either.

665
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,759
Okay.

666
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:20,519
That’s wonderful.

667
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,000
This family, honestly…

668
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,319
watch your sense of boundaries.

669
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,759
I’m having a moment with my sis.

670
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,799
Fine, you two be sentimental.

671
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,440
I’ll just finish that joke.

672
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,680
So, Bai Suzhen

673
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,559
couldn’t move after putting on a hat.

674
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,279
Why?

675
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,400
Because the hat she put on

676
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,400
was a “snake–pressing” hat.

677
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,440
Mind reading.

678
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,720
Once again, you and I

679
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:40,720
are totally on the same wavelength.

680
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,960
You even said the exact words

681
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,039
I was about to say next.

682
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,880
The mood’s all built up to this point.

683
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,200
Right now I should shout,

684
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,160
“Everybody,

685
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
let’s make dumplings together!”

686
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,319
Sis, I actually hit a snag today.

687
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,839
I mixed a milk tea at work,

688
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,279
my boss says it’ll never sell.

689
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:00,400
What kind of milk tea?

690
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,000
Stinky tofu, fish mint, and surströmming—

691
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,799
a special–blend milk tea.

692
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,199
Yeah.

693
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,480
My boss had that exact look.

694
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,119
We can fix this.

695
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:15,400
Bro,

696
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,480
don’t you worry.

697
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,400
Your brother–in–law

698
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,599
will definitely back you up.

699
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,039
He can finish every last cup.

700
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,480
It’s so nice having a sister.

701
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,079
Not so nice for your brother–in–law.

702
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:42,840
Addiction—

703
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,599
a bad habit in Earthlings’ shared unconscious.

704
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,039
It can take on

705
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,039
all sorts of different forms.

706
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,199
According to my very rough stats,

707
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,559
every single human

708
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,280
shows at least one sign

709
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,000
of being addicted.

710
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,119
Ridiculous.

711
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,760
We aliens

712
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,760
can’t get addicted to anything.

713
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,760
Where’s my toothbrush?

714
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:07,920
Which toothbrush?

715
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,119
Take a look—

716
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,960
isn’t that the one I use on the toilet?

717
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:12,800
My bad.

718
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,760
I was being a bit absolute.

719
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,679
When it comes to roasting Meng Hang,

720
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,480
I really can’t quit.

721
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,519
Found it.
