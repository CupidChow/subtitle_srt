1
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,560
Buying all sorts of random stuff again.

2
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,319
What random stuff?

3
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,639
Meng Hang is throwing me a birthday.

4
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,439
Shouldn't I show my appreciation?

5
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,199
A return gift, right?

6
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,639
Meng Hang will wear this for the birthday?

7
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,039
I meant myself.

8
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,840
I need to show I care.

9
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,240
Attend in style.

10
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,639
You all have too much free time.

11
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,400
We never celebrated birthdays back home.

12
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,400
Yeah, that's why I'm not living there now.

13
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,560
Now you're at my place.

14
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
We do celebrate here.

15
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,479
Do they have a custom on Earth

16
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,919
where kids give their mom a red envelope on their birthday?

17
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
After all, it's my

18
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,120
day of suffering.

19
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,479
What suffering did you go through?

20
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,919
I was hatched by a machine.

21
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,599
Besides,

22
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,759
all these years,

23
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,680
I've suffered plenty with you.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,319
You never gave me a red envelope.

25
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,360
Technically,

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,280
you should get me a birthday present.

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,639
I can't attend your birthday.

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,479
I've got plans.

29
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,919
Do you even know my birthday?

30
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,319
Whatever day it is, I'm busy.

31
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,639
This color—

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,599
Only I can pull it off.

33
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:57,879
Mom.

34
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,080
Mom.

35
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,400
Mom.

36
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,719
Mom, what's wrong?

37
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,599
Quick, throw that thing far away!

38
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,240
What's wrong with it?

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,120
My neck—

40
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,919
Contact with synthetics poisons me.

41
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,639
Did you forget?

42
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,759
You didn't even tell me it's synthetic.

43
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,360
I didn't forget.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
I had no idea.

45
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,839
My head hurts.

46
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,480
My head hurts.

47
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,319
Are you okay?

48
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,040
Good thing you're here.

49
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,360
Otherwise,

50
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,480
I'd still be lying on the floor.

51
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,000
You didn't help me up.

52
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,079
Headache.

53
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,920
I didn't know what was wrong.

54
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,519
I didn't dare move you.

55
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,920
Good kid.

56
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,680
Help your mom up.

57
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,079
Mom.

58
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:15,920
Or maybe

59
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,199
you could move around yourself?

60
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,879
I'm afraid you'll blame me.

61
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,199
This kid...

62
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,120
My head really hurts.

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,879
I saw that first aid video.

64
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,079
You shouldn't stand up.

65
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,480
My baby girl is so thoughtful.

66
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,600
I'm fine now.

67
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,519
Go do your thing.

68
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,759
Mom, you—

69
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,839
Are you sure you're okay?

70
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,240
In a bit,

71
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm going to the bank

72
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,839
to withdraw some money.

73
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,360
What for?

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,600
Didn't you

75
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
want a birthday present?

76
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,160
I don't know what you like.

77
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,399
I'll just give you a red envelope.

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,199
Wait—

79
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:11,879
Mom, you—

80
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,839
Don't scare me.

81
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,240
I'm really fine.

82
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,480
See?

83
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,920
My arms and legs aren't hurt at all.

84
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,639
Alright, you've been busy all day.

85
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,920
Go get some rest.

86
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,959
I'm off to cook for my baby girl.

87
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,079
Wait a second.

88
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,600
What did you just say?

89
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,839
Going to cook for you.

90
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,920
Not that—before that.

91
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,680
What did you call me?

92
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,800
Baby girl.

93
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,839
You didn't see it.

94
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,920
It was terrifying.

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,839
My mom doesn't even recognize me now.

96
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,120
She calls me baby.

97
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,519
Sis.

98
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,959
Don't worry too much now.

99
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,399
It'll get scarier later.

100
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,519
Why did you two bring me here?

101
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,319
I've got rice simmering on the stove.

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,240
Cai Yi, didn't you get hurt?

103
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,680
So you can't go to the hospital.

104
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm right here.

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,519
We'll get someone to check you out.

106
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,600
Come on, Cai Yi.

107
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,800
Close your eyes, let me take a look.

108
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,519
Alright, open your mouth.

109
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,639
Do you know what you're doing?

110
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,680
On my home planet, I have a double degree in medicine and law.

111
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,360
Double degree?

112
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,120
Medicine and law?

113
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,319
So if you kill a patient,

114
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,680
you can handle your own lawsuit.

115
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,199
No need to trouble anyone else.

116
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,079
All done.

117
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,199
Miracle doctor! Miracle doctor!

118
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,399
All better in an instant.

119
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,839
My head hurts.

120
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,879
This young man is really nice.

121
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,240
He looks good, and he's a good person.

122
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,199
How old is he?

123
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,879
Does he have a girlfriend?

124
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,800
Li Li

125
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,560
What's the name of your friend again?

126
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,519
It's gotten worse again.

127
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,199
Take another look.

128
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:11,920
Let me check again.

129
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,600
Come on, open your mouth.

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,639
Looks like a strained back.

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,720
Strained back.

132
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,399
Right.

133
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,480
How can her personality change?

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,439
It's the strained back.

135
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,079
It also pressed on a nerve

136
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,480
that goes straight to the brain.

137
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,399
It can cause a big personality shift.

138
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,160
It can also come with

139
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,639
mild memory loss.

140
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,159
But you don't need to worry.

141
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,480
After midnight tonight,

142
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,039
it'll recover on its own.

143
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,879
So this personality change,

144
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,919
how drastic can it get?

145
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,519
Compared to before,

146
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,759
it'll make a three hundred sixty degree turn.

147
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,240
Three hundred sixty degrees?

148
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,639
Wouldn't that mean no change?

149
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,440
Yeah.

150
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,639
I meant one eighty.

151
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,919
Anyway, someone who was really nice before

152
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,360
will become really nasty.

153
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,240
So someone like my mom,

154
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,519
she's just a warm-hearted person.

155
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Brother Meng

156
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,440
What did you call me?

157
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,919
Brother Meng.

158
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,159
I'm going grocery shopping.

159
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,799
What do you want for dinner?

160
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,240
I'll cook for you, okay?

161
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,360
What are you doing?

162
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,120
Sorry, sorry.

163
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,320
I'm late.

164
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,200
It's because

165
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,080
I washed all your sheets and covers.

166
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,960
So it took some extra time.

167
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
You aren't mad at me, are you?

168
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,679
I get it.

169
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,919
Look, look, look.

170
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,519
What did I tell you yesterday?

171
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,320
Yesterday, we saw a weasel in the yard.

172
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,559
I told you, don't step on it.

173
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,320
But you did.

174
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,759
See?

175
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,200
That must've been Huang Daxian.

176
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,799
It stole your soul.

177
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,879
What are you talking about?

178
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,440
Co-in-law, co-in-law.

179
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,679
You have to hang in there.

180
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,879
I know a master.

181
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,919
He'll definitely have a way.

182
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,559
I, I, I...

183
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,759
I'll go to Wudang Mountain.

184
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,639
You must hold on.

185
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,919
You must hold on.

186
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,559
You must hold on, co-in-law.

187
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,600
Brother Meng

188
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll wait for you.

189
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,279
Come back for dinner.

190
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,440
So much food!

191
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,279
Mom

192
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,320
That's enough, we can't finish it.

193
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,559
My son-in-law works all day, running to several communities.

194
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,399
It's so tiring for him.

195
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,399
He needs a good meal.

196
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,679
Mom, what's wrong?

197
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,960
I feel bad for you.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,799
You're not sick, are you?

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,759
You're the one who's sick.

200
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,320
Head.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,080
Mom made these dishes.

202
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,039
Tell me if they're too salty or bland.

203
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,159
I'll pay attention next time.

204
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,759
Okay, okay.

205
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,639
What's up with Mom?

206
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,600
It's nothing.

207
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,320
She's just caring about you.

208
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,240
Why is this room so quiet?

209
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,279
Li Cai

210
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,279
Where's the rabbit we kept at home?

211
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Looking for the rabbit?

212
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,279
Having soup.

213
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,679
This...

214
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,720
It's ribs.

215
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,039
You mean that rabbit?

216
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,080
I put it in the pet shop.

217
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,799
At the pet shop?

218
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,960
No, I...

219
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:30,960
Where's my dad?

220
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,240
Dad

221
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,559
Brother Meng went to Wudang Mountain.

222
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,759
Brother Meng

223
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,759
Went to Wudang Mountain.

224
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,639
That doesn't make sense.

225
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,840
What are you looking for?

226
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,679
My dad.

227
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,200
Li Li

228
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm a little scared.

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,120
What are you thinking?

230
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,279
I'm a bit nervous.

231
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,720
What are you nervous about?

232
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,480
Your mom, she...

233
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,320
My mom.

234
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,039
My mom's totally fine.

235
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,159
Don't worry about her.

236
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,480
Let's talk about something important.

237
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,200
What important thing?

238
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,799
Tomorrow is your birthday.

239
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,360
Don't worry, I've got it all planned.

240
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,039
Really?

241
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,240
This is the first birthday I'll celebrate for you.

242
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,679
I took half a day off.

243
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,120
I'll make sure you have an unforgettable birthday.

244
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,240
Actually, I've never celebrated my birthday.

245
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,840
You've never had a birthday celebration?

246
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,559
No.

247
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,360
This is an Earth ID.

248
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,000
It has your identity info on Earth.

249
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,559
Pick one.

250
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,320
I'll take this one.

251
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,799
Birthday.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,360
June 30, 1995.

253
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,559
Never celebrated since I was little.

254
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,120
Never.

255
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,759
My mom said it's pointless.

256
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,879
She never let me celebrate.

257
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,000
Li Li

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,840
I promise

259
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,440
to make up for all your missed birthdays.

260
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll make up for every one.

261
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:23,799
Okay.

262
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,639
This time,

263
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,200
we'll have the most unforgettable birthday ever.

264
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,080
Okay.

265
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,519
Sis, you're pretty popular.

266
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,200
Are these all birthday wishes for you?

267
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,320
Of course.

268
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,960
I've got lots of friends.

269
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,639
Thanks to the Dingguagua Cat Food sisters

270
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,960
Wishing you happiness every day

271
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,000
May your business thrive

272
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,279
Thank you, thank you

273
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,519
How did you know it was my birthday?

274
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,240
Did you see that?

275
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,240
This shows birthdays matter to everyone

276
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,679
Even strangers

277
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,200
will send you their wishes

278
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,799
This is such a warm

279
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,519
and caring planet

280
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,879
I just roughly counted

281
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,200
A total of 137 floor tiles are loose

282
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,039
We need to get someone to fix it soon

283
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,320
Okay

284
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,360
There are so many kids in the yard

285
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,639
running around and playing

286
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,000
If someone falls or twists an ankle

287
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,840
that would be a problem

288
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,120
The parents would be so worried

289
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
You're right, Sister Cai

290
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,039
I'll have the engineering team

291
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,000
handle it this afternoon

292
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:46,039
And what trees are planted in front of Building Seven?

293
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,080
Building Seven

294
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,679
Those should be poplars

295
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,759
I think they look like white poplars

296
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,960
Go check it out

297
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,879
Make sure there's no corruption

298
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,559
That shouldn't be the case

299
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,639
The owners paid their property fees

300
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,360
We have to be responsible for everyone

301
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,639
Yes, yes

302
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,639
I'll verify it right away

303
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,120
By the way

304
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:04,759
Sister Cai

305
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,720
We'd like to invite you as our

306
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,200
Honorary Director of Property Management

307
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,840
Please think it over carefully

308
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,159
I have too much going on

309
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,080
I really can't handle it all

310
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,039
How about this

311
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,440
I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow

312
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,080
Okay

313
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,000
Then I'll wait for your reply

314
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,639
Alright, alright

315
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,559
Okay, that's settled then

316
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,679
Sister Zhou

317
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,840
Send me your son's photo

318
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,480
Xu's daughter from Unit Three is also single

319
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,240
Both of them work at big companies

320
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,000
They could get to know each other

321
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,559
Mom, what are you doing?

322
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,879
Just chatting with the neighbors

323
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,759
Daughter

324
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,600
Look

325
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,039
Mom bought you some fish

326
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,240
Do you want it steamed or braised?

327
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,000
What do you mean?

328
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,960
It's your birthday

329
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
You have to eat fish

330
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,919
May you have surplus year after year

331
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,320
It's my birthday

332
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,399
It's not New Year's

333
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,120
Just make dumplings then

334
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,879
I wanted to make you longevity noodles

335
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,080
Dumplings are fine too

336
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,679
Do you want steamed dumplings

337
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,360
boiled or pan-fried dumplings?

338
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,200
I, uh

339
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,399
Let me think about it

340
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,399
Is Aunt Cai's condition getting worse?

341
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,480
The bar owner said

342
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,440
She'll recover after midnight?

343
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,360
I think Aunt Cai's illness is kind of nice

344
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,120
Don't you think she has a kind of

345
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,120
morbid beauty now?

346
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,480
I think you're a bit morbid

347
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,320
Go play with your cat

348
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,000
Look

349
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,960
Mom got you red-dyed eggs

350
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,000
Mom, that's for postpartum recovery

351
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:33,919
Thanks for the reminder

352
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,720
You're almost thirty now

353
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,679
You should hurry and have another child

354
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,720
Alright, alright, that's enough

355
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,360
Okay, Mom

356
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,039
Stop thinking about it

357
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,440
About my birthday

358
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,759
You don't need to fuss over it

359
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,080
Meng Hang has already arranged everything

360
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,440
Your birthday is a big deal for our family

361
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,080
Of course Mom has to be involved

362
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,600
I've already promised Meng Hang

363
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,960
We'll celebrate just the two of us

364
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,039
It's the first time someone is celebrating my birthday

365
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
And this is something I can experience

366
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,480
One of the most important

367
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,840
rituals for Earthlings

368
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,440
It's a rare opportunity

369
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,720
I don't want any regrets

370
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,839
You should've said so earlier

371
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,160
I get it now

372
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,039
Well

373
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,880
What you regret most now is

374
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,799
your hairstyle

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,480
Let's go

376
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,000
Mom will take you to get your hair done

377
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,920
What's wrong with my hair?

378
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:17,680
Alright

379
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,200
What's up?

380
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,920
Sis.

381
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,000
My brother-in-law told me

382
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,279
to tidy up the house a bit.

383
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,240
He said he wants to surprise you.

384
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,599
Come home a bit later.

385
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,599
Go ahead, do your thing.

386
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,200
As for me,

387
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,640
I can't get back right now.

388
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,799
I'm busy.

389
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:38,680
That's great.

390
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,200
Charles.

391
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,039
Your dad

392
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,240
wants you to come home.

393
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,400
Don't be too anxious.

394
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,319
He's just lonely.

395
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,200
Yeah.

396
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
He's really lonely.

397
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,720
The urgent thing

398
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
is you should find him a companion.

399
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,960
He'd be so happy.

400
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,200
He'd be happy,

401
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,160
but what if my mom isn't?

402
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,640
Mom's still here.

403
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,279
So...

404
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:04,960
Then

405
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,279
get him a dog.

406
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,000
Right? They're so cute.

407
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
It could even attract customers to your restaurant.

408
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,039
What's your restaurant called?

409
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,119
Piaoxiang Dog Meat Restaurant.

410
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,319
Then buy two houses.

411
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,240
One in Sanya,

412
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,880
one in Qiqihar.

413
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,599
Go to Sanya in summer,

414
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,359
Qiqihar in winter.

415
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,720
That'll guarantee a long life.

416
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,160
Mom, you're something else.

417
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,759
How do you manage to step on a landmine
with every sentence?

418
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,279
Sis.

419
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,839
That's not fair of you to say.

420
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,279
Even though my Aunt Cai

421
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,839
comes up with terrible ideas,

422
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,680
her intentions are good.

423
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,279
You're being a bit harsh.

424
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,920
I'm harsh?

425
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,599
Look at Aunt Cai—

426
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,160
she's been saying it's your birthday
since early morning.

427
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,640
She went out early to buy fish and groceries.

428
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,279
She even paid for your hair styling.

429
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,519
Spent half the day fussing.

430
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,599
But you went off with your husband.

431
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,319
Is that fair to her?

432
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
It's not me, it's just—

433
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,640
As long as my daughter is happy,

434
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,119
I'm fine with anything.

435
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,079
Aunt Cai.

436
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,960
Parents as thoughtful as you

437
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,799
are rare these days.

438
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,200
How about this—

439
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,880
I'll make you my godmother.

440
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,200
That's wonderful!

441
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,680
Today is truly a great day.

442
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,200
Not only did I

443
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,319
give birth to Li Li,

444
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,519
I also gained a godson.

445
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,079
You two should celebrate together.

446
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,240
Li Li.

447
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,480
Call him brother.

448
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,480
Say "brother."

449
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,599
Just shave my head.

450
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,759
You two celebrate, I'll become a monk.

451
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:38,680
Li Li.

452
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,640
Li Li.

453
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,359
Don't be mad.

454
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,920
I was just chatting with the neighbor.

455
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,200
I never said

456
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,799
I'd make Charles my godson.

457
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,160
I'm confused too.

458
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,119
Back then,

459
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,799
when you were cold and mean,

460
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,920
our mother-daughter bond was bad.

461
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,559
Now you're warm-hearted,

462
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,400
but our relationship still isn't good.

463
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,079
I must've been awful before.

464
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,079
Did you forget? Back then,

465
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,200
all through my childhood,

466
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,680
you never cared for me.

467
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,799
Only criticism, never praise.

468
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,519
Sarcasm counted as affection.

469
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,960
Putting me down meant you cared.

470
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,839
Seems I'm really not a good person.

471
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,039
It's not all your fault.

472
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,680
Our home planet is just like that.

473
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,480
You and Dad—

474
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,640
weren't happy together,

475
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,319
but not sad apart either.

476
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,480
I don't want that for myself.

477
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,359
Sounds like our family has big issues.

478
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,359
And no one to mediate.

479
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:36,960
So,

480
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,640
no matter how advanced a planet is,

481
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,240
it needs a neighborhood committee.

482
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,240
Our planet doesn't have one.

483
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,640
That's why our planet is way behind Earth.

484
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,039
You really like Earth, huh?

485
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,599
But you'll have to return to the home planet for work.

486
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,119
What about Meng Hang?

487
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,319
I've been thinking—

488
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,599
I'll apply to stay with the editorial department.

489
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,640
If that doesn't work, I'll quit.

490
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,680
I have a job on Earth anyway.

491
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,400
You've really decided?

492
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,160
Not going back to the home planet?

493
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,599
I've made up my mind.

494
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,119
I truly love Meng Hang.

495
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,000
So I can't leave him.

496
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,880
Plus, there's his dad,

497
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,279
and all my friends.

498
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,920
I can't bear to leave.

499
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,119
I don't know what's wrong with me.

500
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,359
Why am I so fragile now?

501
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:30,680
Maybe

502
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,920
that's Earth's superpower.

503
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,480
What?

504
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,359
The thing you just mentioned—

505
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,599
Love.

506
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,920
Li Li, you look beautiful today.

507
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,119
This hairstyle suits you perfectly.

508
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,119
Really?

509
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,759
I prepared these photos of us.

510
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,599
Take a look.

511
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:24,920
Come on, come on.

512
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,039
See what I've got ready.

513
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,279
Come.

514
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,480
Sit.

515
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:36,799
Thank you.

516
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,519
Thank you.

517
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,079
Sis.

518
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,079
Happy birthday.

519
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,079
Thank you.

520
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,839
Why are you here?

521
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,240
To join your birthday party.

522
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,200
What party?

523
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,799
Can't you see this is

524
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,279
a world for two?

525
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,720
But I've been busy all day.

526
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,279
You won't even let me eat dinner?

527
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,799
You call that a dinner?

528
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,839
Hurry up and go.

529
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,720
Brother-in-law, be the judge.

530
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,839
I've been busy all day.

531
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:11,759
My sister won't let me eat.

532
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,720
Let me be fair here.

533
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,200
Use my chopsticks.

534
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,640
Have a shrimp first.

535
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,920
Once you start, you won't stop. Hurry.

536
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,319
I'll eat everything.

537
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,880
I'm hungry.

538
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,839
Go, you're not hungry.

539
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,359
Go, go, go. I'm hungry.

540
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,039
Come here.

541
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,839
Let me tell you,

542
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,839
today is a world for two for me and your brother-in-law.

543
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,880
No one is allowed to interrupt.

544
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,200
Don't worry, sis.

545
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,960
I'll just eat.

546
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,759
I won't talk.

547
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,720
I can't starve at my own sister's house, right?

548
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,079
I'll bring you dinner later.

549
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,599
Stay quiet in this room.

550
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,480
Don't disturb us.

551
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,319
Okay?

552
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:44,920
Okay.

553
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,720
Then later,

554
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,079
keep it down out there, you two.

555
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,559
Don't disturb my meal, okay?

556
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,119
Happy birthday.

557
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,039
Braised fish.

558
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,599
Mom, when did you get back?

559
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,720
I just came to make you two some dishes.

560
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,119
You two go on, keep going.

561
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,599
Li Li.

562
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
Actually, there are a few things

563
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,720
I've wanted to tell you for a while.

564
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,079
It's just that

565
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
I never found the right time.

566
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,319
I...

567
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,599
Braised shrimp.

568
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:30,960
You two go on.

569
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,640
Go on.

570
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,640
The first time

571
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,680
I met you,

572
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,119
my impression of you

573
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,519
wasn't what you think.

574
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,359
What do you mean?

575
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,319
But...

576
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,279
Dumplings.

577
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,839
Li Li wants some.

578
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,880
Mom.

579
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,519
Last one, last one.

580
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,359
The first meeting...

581
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,079
Um...

582
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,400
Wait till all the dishes are here to talk.

583
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,720
What's this?

584
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Cake.

585
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
There's writing on it.

586
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,680
Wishing

587
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,839
Li Li a happy birthday.

588
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,720
Mom.

589
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,079
Your name has too many strokes.

590
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,720
My hand shook a bit,

591
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,400
so it all got smudged together.

592
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,440
More strokes are good.

593
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,279
More strokes are good.

594
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,680
Back in school, to get more cream,

595
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,880
I told the cake seller my name was

596
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,079
Meng XX.

597
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,720
You made this yourself?

598
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,799
First time making it.

599
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,279
It just turned out too ugly.

600
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,160
It's not pretty, you guys...

601
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,799
Just make do and eat it, okay?

602
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,160
Mom, sit down and eat with us.

603
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,240
No, thanks.

604
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,920
I'm going to the pet shop.

605
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,359
No, the pet shop is closed.

606
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,720
Those little animals haven't eaten yet.

607
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,480
When we first met...

608
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,480
That day...

609
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,359
Wait a moment.

610
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,079
Mom.

611
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,599
Mom.

612
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,160
Don't go yet.

613
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:23,960
Wait for me.

614
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,319
Meng Hang.

615
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,720
Thank you for preparing

616
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,960
such a wonderful birthday for me.

617
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,279
I'm really touched.

618
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,880
I promise you,

619
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,759
from now on, we'll spend every birthday together.

620
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:46,960
For a lifetime.

621
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,839
I'll be just as thoughtful as you were today.

622
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,759
But tonight,

623
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,400
I want to spend it with my mom.

624
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,039
Is that okay?

625
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,799
As long as you're happy.

626
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,519
Then I'll go keep Li Cai company.

627
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,559
Keep him in, don't let him out.

628
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,640
Don't worry.

629
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:28,599
Mom.

630
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,799
Come in.

631
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:30,559
What is it?

632
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,640
It's your birthday.

633
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,960
No, no, no.

634
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,200
You celebrate with Xiao Meng.

635
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,319
No Xiao Meng.

636
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,079
Just the two of us.

637
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,079
Happy birthday to you.

638
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,160
Happy birthday to you.

639
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,759
Happy birthday to you.

640
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,720
Happy birthday to you.

641
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,759
I hope my daughter

642
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,799
is as happy every day as she is today.

643
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,720
Then I wish my mom

644
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,960
can be like today every day.

645
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,000
This child...

646
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,160
Mom is sick today.

647
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,279
I don't care.

648
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,720
It's my birthday anyway.

649
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,480
When it's your birthday,

650
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,319
I'll wish you good health then.

651
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,839
In those human TV dramas,

652
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,799
on birthdays,

653
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,920
they talk about happy memories.

654
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,519
But the two of us,

655
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,200
we have nothing.

656
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,240
It's kind of boring.

657
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Oh right, I think

658
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,519
we're supposed to make a wish.

659
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,200
Need to light candles.

660
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,440
Let me try.

661
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:57,960
Hurry, make a wish.

662
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,920
I made a wish.

663
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,799
No.

664
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,079
Why?

665
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,319
Because my wish has already come true.

666
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,680
What wish?

667
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,359
Right now.

668
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,200
Since I was little,

669
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,160
I've always wished for this moment.

670
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,119
This kid...

671
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,720
Mom can't understand you anymore.

672
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,359
Mom.

673
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,000
Should I blow out the candle?

674
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,319
I don't know either.

675
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,119
Let me try.

676
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:30,079
Forget it.

677
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,920
It's fine, Mom.

678
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,200
No, just leave it.

679
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,400
What are you doing?

680
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,400
Getting something to eat.

681
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,519
I'm telling you,

682
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,200
you're not going out tonight.

683
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,359
Just stay here.

684
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,160
I'm so hungry my stomach's in knots.

685
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,559
Do you have any fried dough twists?

686
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,240
No.

687
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,160
Mom, why won't that song stop?

688
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,200
Yeah.

689
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,279
Is it going to play forever?

690
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
I searched everywhere

691
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,279
in Dad's room.

692
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,440
Only found this one can.

693
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,119
When we're out, Brother-in-law will treat you.

694
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:40,680
Brother-in-law.

695
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,119
For both dogs and cats.

696
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,559
Go ahead, eat.

697
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,799
Aren't you a dog in the zodiac?

698
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:48,720
Want to try it?

699
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I don't like this flavor.

700
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,759
It's pretty good.

701
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,480
Isn't it?

702
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,519
Brother-in-law.

703
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,759
Who said you could hold mine?

704
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,640
You even slept in my bed.

705
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,160
No.

706
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,920
Yesterday you said the sofa was cold.

707
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,079
You let me sleep here, remember?

708
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,279
How come I don't remember that?

709
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,640
Darn, you're back to normal.

710
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,200
Yesterday,

711
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
you celebrated my birthday.

712
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,839
I celebrated your birthday?

713
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,240
You're imagining things.

714
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,680
See?

715
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,440
I knew you'd never admit it.

716
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,160
I took pictures.

717
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,079
I'll send them to you now.

718
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,319
You even took photos?

719
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,279
Look.

720
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,039
Sweet, right?

721
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
So gross.

722
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,000
How do I delete this thing?

723
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:34,880
Mom.

724
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,160
You—what "Mom"?

725
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:38,839
You're wearing shoes.

726
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:41,240
You slept in my bed with your shoes on.

727
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,200
No, you said my feet would get cold.

728
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,480
So you made me keep them on.

729
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,359
Hurry up, I'm telling you—

730
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,240
All these sheets and covers,

731
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,160
wash them all, right now.

732
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,119
Don't make me mad.

733
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,159
A birthday party is a special ritual.

734
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,840
I've attended a few before.

735
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,400
But at this one,

736
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,159
this birthday-themed party,

737
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,280
I've never been told

738
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,719
the main person's age.

739
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,440
They relive it year after year,

740
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,360
that eighteenth birthday party.

741
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,159
That party must've been a real mess.

742
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,239
Anyway,

743
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,880
birthdays are the most important day for Earthlings.

744
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,559
But there's no holiday for it.

745
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,199
Yeah.

746
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,559
Even funerals get a day off.

747
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,039
How can birthdays not have one?

748
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,440
You have to fight for your rights.

749
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,960
Sis.

750
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,480
Let me ask you—

751
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,000
Our company gives time off for funerals,

752
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,360
but not for birthdays, right?

753
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,920
So how about this—

754
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,280
On my birthday,

755
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,199
give me a day off.

756
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,440
When I die,

757
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,840
I promise I'll show up to work on time.
