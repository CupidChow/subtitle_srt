1
00:00:57,275 --> 00:01:00,405
Before he got known as Mark Keifer Watson,

2
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:02,872
the public already knew Andres Muhlach.

3
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,047
A showbiz royalty

4
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:07,659
and one of the twins of

5
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:09,984
Aga Muhlach and Charlene Gonzalez.

6
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:14,104
Andres already appeared in many commercials
at a young age.

7
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:17,815
Even though he left the spotlight
to focus on his studies,

8
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:22,112
it seems like he’s
destined to enter showbiz.

9
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:24,842
After a few years of absence,

10
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:27,673
Andres finally entered
the entertainment industry

11
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:28,880
as an actor.

12
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:33,214
With his family in the
sitcom, “Da Pers Family”.

13
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,439
Coming from season one,

14
00:01:34,472 --> 00:01:37,139
that was my first series.

15
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:38,378
And...

16
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:41,814
like I had little to no
experience at that time.

17
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:45,472
Ashtine Olviga was an aspiring singer.

18
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:49,163
and was part of the singing competition,
“Born to be a Star”.

19
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:51,347
Despite not winning the title,

20
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:55,605
it became her stepping
stone to get projects.

21
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:57,298
From supporting roles,

22
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:01,035
to being part of the lead stars in films

23
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,560
like “Sunny”

24
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,706
and “Marita”

25
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,380
I’ve been saying this before

26
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:09,439
that I was praying to
at least get a project.

27
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,205
And my only wish back then was

28
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:15,572
to get picked when there are auditions.

29
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:16,872
Any role will do.

30
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:18,239
As long as it’s work then go.

31
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:24,305
Rabin Angeles was discovered by
renowned director, Jason Paul Laxamana.

32
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:27,003
He appeared in many films

33
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:29,972
Mostly supporting roles.

34
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:35,393
But his charm and
potential was very evident.

35
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,893
I really prayed to God that

36
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,884
Lord, even if I don’t get to sleep

37
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:43,339
I’ll do it.

38
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,347
Even if I get very exhausted.

39
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:46,972
Because I’m happy with this,

40
00:02:46,972 --> 00:02:48,205
I’m happy when we’re taping.

41
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:49,339
I said.

42
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,372
And God gave it to me.

43
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:54,198
It’s really an answered prayer.

44
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:58,325
Before they got known as part
of “Ang Mutya ng Section E”,

45
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,057
some of the cast have already
appeared in different projects.

46
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:07,003
While it’s a debut acting
project for the others.

47
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:11,295
Hoping to get a break from their first
acting project.

48
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:14,372
And they made the right decision.

49
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,170
Last year, I wasn’t as busy as this.

50
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:20,239
But now I’m thankful
when I get a rest time.

51
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:22,414
I've been in Viva for eight years

52
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,772
and this is my first
major project with them.

53
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,395
Even as a supporting role.

54
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:29,276
Really was one of those
dream-come-true moments.

55
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:30,784
They say,

56
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:35,448
the stars aligned for the cast
of “Ang Mutya ng Section E”.

57
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:42,172
Because it’s the most well-received cast

58
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:46,239
for a big and popular Wattpad title.

59
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:51,647
Indeed,

60
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:53,758
they were meant for their roles.

61
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:06,657
The series started with a
record breaking success.

62
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,947
The pilot episode got one million streams,

63
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:12,772
of “Ang Mutya ng Section E”.

64
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,179
And in just two weeks,

65
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,398
it garnered three million streams.

66
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:22,914
Since then, the success
of the series continued.

67
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:26,307
Every episode each week was trending.

68
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,883
Fan edits were getting millions of views.

69
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:33,141
This boosted the show’s
popularity even more.

70
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:37,154
Even the international audience got hooked.

71
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:40,548
Even the soundtrack from the series

72
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:41,970
experienced a boost in popularity.

73
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:56,772
The series catapulted the lead stars Andres
Muhlach, Ashtine Olviga, and Rabin Angeles

74
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,239
into superstardom.

75
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,339
Jam-packed on-ground events,

76
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:04,024
and impressive social media engagements

77
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:07,472
not just for the lead stars
but for the whole cast.

78
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:10,839
The impact of the series is felt

79
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:13,305
in the fast growing careers of the cast.

80
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,872
Impact? It’s big.

81
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,439
If we’re talking about work.

82
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:21,112
I got more opportunities,

83
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:26,318
and so many doors opened
for me and my career.

84
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,893
And...

85
00:05:28,264 --> 00:05:32,064
aside from that, I gained more supporters.

86
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:34,005
And I really felt that.

87
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,405
Because before, I often say this,

88
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,305
when I have solo or group activites,

89
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,268
there’s none of them.

90
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,047
Well there’s some, but very few.

91
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:47,105
But now there’s so many of them.

92
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:49,672
That’s why I’m very thankful.

93
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:54,578
“Ang Mutya ng Section
E” really changed my life.

94
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:56,792
All of us.

95
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,073
Really.

96
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,705
I’m super thankful for this project.

97
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,077
To all the people who followed the series.

98
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,272
We are just so thankful for your support.

99
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,872
The series ended on a high note.

100
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:15,261
To celebrate its success,

101
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:20,739
they held two sold out shows
entitled “Section E Nation”.

102
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:22,405
Let me hear you scream!

103
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:23,572
[crowd screaming]

104
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,905
Followed by “Mutya OST concert”.

105
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:31,005
The cast also performed
at the Araneta Coliseum

106
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:33,800
as part of Vivarkada.

107
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:39,339
It’s very heartwarming because

108
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:46,401
when it started, all of us,
we didn’t expect it to be this big.

109
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,589
Then we had those concerts
and many people came.

110
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:52,042
The impact was huge because

111
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:55,120
people really thought that I’m grumpy.

112
00:06:56,872 --> 00:06:58,737
It had a big impact on us.

113
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:01,011
It was really huge.

114
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:02,307
As in.

115
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,372
Even going international

116
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,323
we didn’t expect that.

117
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:10,172
Even older people watched the show.

118
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:11,772
So we’re very thankful.

119
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,972
It’s crazy. I didn’t really expect that-

120
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,222
I mean I’ve always had faith
and big hopes for Mutya

121
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:23,747
I’ve always known that it will blow up.

122
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:28,205
But it never crossed my mind that

123
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:33,229
we’ll be performing
almost like every other day

124
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,639
to the fans of Mutya.

125
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,872
That’s why we’re so thankful.

126
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,272
“Ang Mutya ng Section E”

127
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:43,505
“Ang Mutya ng Section E”

128
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:46,139
“Ang Mutya ng Section E”

129
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:48,655
“Ang Mutya ng Section E”

130
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,039
“Ang Mutya ng Section E”

131
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,472
“Ang Mutya ng Section E”

132
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:58,139
“Ang Mutya ng Section E”

133
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:05,668
I still haven’t realized the impact
this show has had

134
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,326
for not only my career,

135
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,831
for Ash’s career,

136
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:11,503
Rabin and even everyone on the show.

137
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,872
Like a lot of things has happened

138
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:13,747
and...

139
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:18,011
Overall, I’m honestly really proud
of everyone in Mutya because

140
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:20,139
in a way, coming from this show,

141
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:23,364
we all were able to start our own journeys

142
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:24,580
in our own way and

143
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,739
more and more work came in.

144
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,605
So, I’m really happy that we all got
to experience them.

145
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:32,172
The blessing that is this show.

146
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,047
Because of the phenomenal
success of the series,

147
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:48,272
many of the cast had different projects.

148
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:54,042
Ashtine and Andres starred in their
first movie together entitled “Minamahal”.

149
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:57,472
It received overwhelming support
from all over the country.

150
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:00,159
The clamor for Ashtine and Andres was felt

151
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:03,370
when they had a
provincial tour for the film.

152
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:08,472
It was a bonus that more people
started supporting and loving all of us.

153
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:11,997
And more doors opened for us.

154
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:13,114
And it’s not just us.

155
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,347
It’s not only the lead cast that got
opportunites after the show.

156
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,479
All of us.

157
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,682
You know, we’re given
the chance to do a film.

158
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:28,005
We experienced a promo tour
in different provinces in the Philippines.

159
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,263
We were able to go to Iloilo, even Cebu.

160
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:35,439
And we were able to go to certain campuses

161
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:37,414
for the promo of “Minamahal”.

162
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,172
Of course with Ashtine and...

163
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:40,939
yeah it’s like

164
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:45,005
something new for me.

165
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:47,372
So what we did was...

166
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:52,619
We went to different places
to promote “Minamahal”.

167
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:57,539
It’s so crazy. We didn’t expect that.

168
00:09:57,572 --> 00:10:03,956
Because when we arrived at the school,
so many people were screaming

169
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:09,605
We were actually late
but they were still there.

170
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,667
They really waited for us to see us

171
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,539
even for a short amount of time.

172
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:19,205
But we know we were
able to make them happy.

173
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:24,339
And we didn’t really feel tired at all.

174
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:25,780
It’s like we’re not there to work.

175
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:30,772
Because every scream and every support

176
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,472
wipes away the fatigue.

177
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:37,823
Rabin also starred in the series,
“Seducing Drake Palma”.

178
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:43,401
Co-starring with Angela Muji, who
plays Rakki in “Ang Mutya ng Section E”.

179
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:48,505
He was also joined by other cast members
of “Ang Mutya ng Section E”.

180
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:53,472
I couldn’t believe that so many things
happened in just one year.

181
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:55,305
My life really changed.

182
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,372
GAT appeared in different shows
and released their own singles.

183
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,872
All of us in GAT are very thankful that

184
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:17,972
we were given the chance to do
a rendition of the intro[theme] song.

185
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,505
Of course “Daleng dale”

186
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,672
that’s our hit song.

187
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:25,605
The support from the fans for that song
has been so helpful.

188
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,172
And we’re just so thankful.

189
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:30,339
It’s so fun to go out and perform that
with the boys because

190
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,905
of course we’re bringing
a part of AMNSE with us.

191
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,430
And we’re also showing another side of us,
which is GAT.

192
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,405
Even the other casts
got different projects.

193
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:46,282
A testament to how the series opened doors
for more opportunities for the whole cast.

194
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:50,739
The biggest impact is that the fans
never left us since day one.

195
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:53,639
This is what I like most about this fandom.

196
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,205
Because they’re not just fans to us,
they became a family.

197
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,368
So even if we have projects
outside of “Ang Mutya ng Section E”

198
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:06,472
they’re still there, supporting us.

199
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:13,305
We really appreciate the supporters
who are still active until now.

200
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,407
I just finished taping “Seducing
Drake Palma” a month and a half ago.

201
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:18,947
Some people start recognizing me

202
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,372
even some kids recognize me from
“Ang Mutya ng Section E.”

203
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:28,172
And I got more opportunites
for other projects.

204
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:29,505
Like “Bad Genius”.

205
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,880
After season one, many opportunities came.

206
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:37,305
Especially for me, I’ll be part of a
Viva One project. Another series.

207
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:38,805
So watch out for that.

208
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:44,641
We have an upcoming
play, “Bagets: the Musical.”

209
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:49,774
So many things happened,
so many opportunites came.

210
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,905
And I’m so grateful for season one.

211
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,605
Because it’s been a big
milestone in my career.

212
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,505
Season one.

213
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:03,405
And I’m just so grateful.

214
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,405
It feels so good that
we’re succeeding together.

215
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:26,172
Three, two, one and... action!

216
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,933
And after months of waiting...

217
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:37,331
the series is finally back
for the much-awaited season two.

218
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:40,172
We’re back!

219
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,329
I’m sure you have a long list of people
to say sorry to.

220
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:55,347
I’m not giving up on you, Jay.

221
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,539
I’ll fight for you.

222
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:02,739
Game on.

223
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:14,589
Definitely everytime I
put on the HVIS uniform,

224
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:17,048
I definitely feel Keifer coming back to me.

225
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:20,972
The whole vibe or aura that is
“Ang Mutya ng Section E.”

226
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:22,639
You know it’s a really great feeling.

227
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,239
And honestly, though it’s not even
a year yet since then,

228
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,805
it already feels nostalgic.

229
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:29,939
Everytime we wear our uniforms

230
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,905
it feels like we’re coming back
to what we used to do.

231
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,372
And this is it, this is what made us all.

232
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:38,939
Very exciting and emotional

233
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,672
because it’s almost one year since
we last put these on.

234
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:45,563
So when we put them on,
I really felt like we’re back in HVIS.

235
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:47,205
Feels really good.

236
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:49,439
Actually just wearing it
already makes me happy.

237
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:53,139
Actually last time during
the Vivarkada concert,

238
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:56,139
There’s a part there where we have to
wear the uniforms of Section E.

239
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,772
And when I put it on,

240
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,339
I really missed shooting.

241
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,972
So when we got to wear
them on the first day,

242
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:05,972
it feels great going
back to shooting again.

243
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,105
We’re more comfortable with each other
so it feels better to shoot now.

244
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:10,572
I’m so happy.

245
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:12,714
I’ve been looking
forward to this for so long.

246
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:15,872
Nothing compares to the set of
“Ang Mutya ng Section E.”

247
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:17,472
So being able to wear the uniform

248
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,514
is like a medal of honor.

249
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:22,005
And being Freya is such a delight.

250
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,014
Wow, I’ve been waiting
for this for so long.

251
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,305
I was so happy when the shoot started.

252
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:29,205
It’s the type of work where I feel like

253
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:31,847
I’m getting paid to hang out with friends.

254
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:33,805
I’m so happy to be back on the set.

255
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:38,405
And of course I get to bring life to the
character of Felix again for Season two.

256
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:42,505
My first day as Andrew Klondike Mercado
in season one,

257
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:45,139
I was so nervous and pressured,

258
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:48,295
but now in season two, it’s very nostalgic.

259
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,272
It’s like we’re back to our first day

260
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:53,505
of seeing each other, even though
we often see each other and play.

261
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:56,572
And it’s also nice to meet
new staff also from Viva,

262
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:59,597
who are now part of “Ang Mutya
ng Section E: The Dark Side.”

263
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,695
Some of the cast got
busy with other projects

264
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:07,773
So we’re so happy when we
reunited for the first time.

265
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,339
For season two.

266
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:11,730
We really missed each other.

267
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,888
Even if we don’t see each other a lot,

268
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:16,513
we still have constant communication.

269
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:18,038
We share stories.

270
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,880
I mean nothing ever changes.

271
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,772
The bond that we had in the first season

272
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:33,505
is still here in the second book.

273
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:35,705
On and off work, even
when the book is done,

274
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:38,639
the question of whether or not
the chemistry would still be there

275
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,114
wasn’t something that had to be asked.

276
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,514
Because it’s always been there.

277
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:44,405
This is so fun and memorable for me.

278
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:45,705
Since this is my first series,

279
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,072
I got a new family and friends.

280
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:51,614
My acting skills were improved.

281
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,372
It feels sureal because
I’ve waited for this.

282
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:58,305
I missed being Calix.

283
00:16:58,305 --> 00:16:59,572
I feel so free.

284
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:02,195
And whenever we’re in
Section E at the classroom,

285
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,648
it’s like we’re automatically in character.

286
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,205
And our bond is so natural.

287
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:09,605
I gotta say it feels good.

288
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,247
It feels good to be Edrix again.

289
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:13,839
I miss Edrix because he was
in the backpocket for a while.

290
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,205
But now I finally got to take him out.

291
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:17,505
And it’s really fun.

292
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,772
So here we go Season two, the dark side.

293
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:20,814
Crazy.

294
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,972
First, it’s really fun
because I’m in HVIS again.

295
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:25,572
Of course there’s still pressure.

296
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:27,639
Still learning the ropes at the taping.

297
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,605
I really missed this building.

298
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:31,639
It really became our school.

299
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:34,405
When we returned for our first day,

300
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:36,439
the feeling was nostalgic.

301
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:38,214
This is like our house.

302
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,572
Of course I’m excited to see the boys.

303
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:43,331
And this classroom.

304
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:45,747
It’s full of vandals.

305
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:48,839
I’m so excited to shoot again.

306
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,012
In every location that we go to,

307
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,037
whenever we see each other again,

308
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:57,395
it’s so fun because the
bond is still the same.

309
00:17:57,972 --> 00:18:00,205
So taping is easy for us

310
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,205
because we’re like siblings
who are playing around.

311
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:07,905
It’s so fun to go back
to our old locations.

312
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:10,472
The memories keep coming back.

313
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,272
It’s really good. It feels nostalgic.

314
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:15,505
We don’t feel as pressured as season one.

315
00:18:15,505 --> 00:18:17,972
Because it feels like it’s still the same.

316
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:18,980
Nothing changed.

317
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:20,639
All of the cast are saying
it’s a good pressure.

318
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,239
Which I think is true.

319
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:26,572
Everything that we’re trying to achieve now

320
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:27,947
comes with pressure really.

321
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:30,072
Because what’s a goal without pressure.

322
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,505
Honestly there’s pressure because

323
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:34,114
season one was so incredible.

324
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:36,639
But season two will give a good fight

325
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:38,314
because the dark side is crazy.

326
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:39,905
I wouldn’t say that it’s pressure.

327
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:43,014
We all just wanna come
here and do our best.

328
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,214
And continue to put out something
for the viewers to enjoy.

329
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:48,739
And coming from where
we left off in season one,

330
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:49,914
a lot of things have changed.

331
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,472
First and foremost, we have a new director.

332
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:57,163
One of the biggest surprises
is having a new director.

333
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:01,615
The blockbuster director, Petersen Vargas.

334
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:04,505
I guess the biggest
announcement for today is—

335
00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:06,005
we have a new director.

336
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,905
Yehey!

337
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:14,921
- Hi!
- Hello!

338
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,912
I just want to introduce myself.
I’m Petersen Vargas.

339
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:21,139
We’re not the same age.
I just look like it.

340
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:23,272
But you can call me Direk P.

341
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:26,697
I’ve been working in the industry
for the past 10 years,

342
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:30,088
but I only became really active
during the pandemic.

343
00:19:30,113 --> 00:19:34,213
Hello, I am Petersen Vargas,
and I’m a film director.

344
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:37,212
Of course, I’m already aware of
Ang Mutya ng Section E.

345
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:39,047
So I was really surprised because

346
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:41,609
for such a big and successful show,

347
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:42,654
I’ll be taking it on.

348
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,079
There’s pressure right away.

349
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:48,538
But I think it was the right step

350
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:51,429
because it has always been
one of my dreams

351
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:55,086
and aspirations to direct
and head a youth show.

352
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,111
I’m really just so grateful

353
00:19:57,136 --> 00:20:00,500
because one of the people
I genuinely look up to

354
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:02,925
in the industry is the director
of the first season,

355
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,016
Director Theodore Boborol.

356
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,075
I’ve been a fan of his
since Vince, Kath & James.

357
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,100
I actually watched the pilot because
I was very, very curious back then—

358
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,343
“What is this show that keeps
showing up on my feed?”

359
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:17,202
Actually, after I saw season one

360
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:19,693
my assignment of course
was to read the books,

361
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,242
because our goal is not just
to understand the show

362
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:26,180
but eventually also to understand

363
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:28,839
the voice behind the show, which is Lara.

364
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:30,664
One.

365
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:31,812
Two.

366
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:33,418
Down!

367
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:34,543
Punch!

368
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,102
Down! Punch!

369
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:43,759
There! Your hand—put it in here

370
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:45,705
You’ll feel it.

371
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:47,305
He tapped already. Let go.

372
00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:51,505
Don’t let go of her hand.

373
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:54,339
You gotta go with the wrist.

374
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:58,039
Hold it! Yes!

375
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:01,812
And of course, the preparations.

376
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:05,437
I’m so happy I got time with the actors
even before shooting.

377
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:06,836
We got to do several workshops—

378
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:09,295
I think it was four days of workshops.

379
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,639
Acting workshops with Ms. Ana Feleo.

380
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,005
We had two days of fight choreography,

381
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:17,539
because there are so many
fight scenes to watch out for.

382
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:21,905
Not just battles of the heart,
but real physical fights.

383
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,405
That’s probably why it’s been called

384
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:24,523
“The Dark Side.”

385
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:29,605
So it’s more of a question—

386
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:30,848
“What’s happening?”

387
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:31,580
You are confused.

388
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:32,805
Stand up, stand up.

389
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:36,505
Go there.

390
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,531
Cut!

391
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,531
Out.

392
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,001
Everyone’s going to get rowdy again later,

393
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:47,026
so you’ll join in..

394
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:50,367
The iconic scene in
season 2 will have to be

395
00:21:50,937 --> 00:21:52,705
the scene

396
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:55,305
when Keifer exposes
his plan in front of Jay-jay

397
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:56,211
and in front of the whole Section E,

398
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:58,156
and he says that iconic line,

399
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:00,081
“I used you and the whole Section E knows."

400
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:03,625
That’s definitely the part,
everyone is looking out for.

401
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:05,538
What you should look forward to with Yuri

402
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:07,272
are his secrets—

403
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:09,138
how he attacks from behind.

404
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:14,272
Every one of us has secrets
you still have to uncover.

405
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,672
That’s why it’s really “The Dark Side.”

406
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:20,072
Before, I really struggled.
I used to count all my heavy scenes.

407
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:24,238
But now, when I read the scripts
from Episodes 1–9,

408
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:26,613
it feels like every
episode has heavy scenes.

409
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,638
So I’m expecting it to be more difficult

410
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,747
and that we’ll really need to focus.

411
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:32,538
We’re giving not just one hundred percent—

412
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:34,772
but one thousand percent.

413
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:39,938
I always make sure I maximize
every scene given to me,

414
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,438
I really internalize it,

415
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:44,138
and I make sure I execute it properly—

416
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:46,338
and of course, effectively.

417
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:51,072
Ci-n, try this—sit down. Sit down.

418
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,416
You know that? What is that?

419
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,574
Are you hearing something?

420
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:07,113
Wow! Beautiful! So cool!

421
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:09,238
I’m very happy and
very excited for Season 2

422
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:13,732
now that we’ll be going deeper
into everyone’s lives

423
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:16,372
and the stories behind everyone.

424
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:20,638
In season 2,
you’ll really see their relationships

425
00:23:20,638 --> 00:23:22,138
what they’re going through,

426
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:24,538
all the chaos that’s still about to happen.

427
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:29,172
We prepared so many fight scenes for you.

428
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:34,132
I’m also excited to see
how I’ll interact with JD Axie,

429
00:23:34,157 --> 00:23:36,747
who plays my older brother, Percy.

430
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:41,738
Well, I’m super happy and excited
because in season one,

431
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:43,938
I only shared scenes with Ashtine,

432
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:46,572
so now I’ll be acting with more people,

433
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,742
and my story will finally be revealed.

434
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,013
So I’m super excited.

435
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:52,289
For me, it’s “The Dark Side”
because this is where

436
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:54,813
the characters’ real stories come out—

437
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:57,475
what’s behind their smiles,

438
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,438
behind their- you know, angry faces,

439
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,272
and the reasons why
they are the way they are.

440
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:06,872
You’ll finally see the scene
“I ran away but asked permission first,”

441
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:08,438
the pancake scenes,

442
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:11,072
and I’ll get kidnapped—so
watch out for that.

443
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:13,947
I think, everyone’s familiar already—

444
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:17,138
we have new characters

445
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,338
Rhen as Honey Bee,

446
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,672
Taneo as Sato,

447
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:24,938
and the rest are still the same.

448
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,438
Whenever we have new characters

449
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:29,538
or- you know, new people to the show,

450
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:30,438
to the cast, the team—

451
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:31,613
it’s a different factor.

452
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:36,438
It’s very nice to keep growing
the family we have here.

453
00:24:36,438 --> 00:24:38,038
I’ve worked with them before,

454
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:41,438
and I’m super happy I get to work
with them again now.

455
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,772
And I have nothing to say
about Rhen and Taneo—

456
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:47,338
they’re just genuinely very kind.

457
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:51,238
I’m really looking forward to building
an even deeper friendship

458
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:53,586
than what we already had before.

459
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:34,238
Of course, there’s the dark side.

460
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:36,072
I feel like

461
00:25:36,072 --> 00:25:38,272
the way I understand youth

462
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:40,638
when we come of age,

463
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:42,038
we really deal with a lot—

464
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:43,438
Like overcoming traumas.

465
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:46,638
So I think they can expect something

466
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:47,572
deeper, darker,

467
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:49,338
and more meaningful from these characters.

468
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:51,338
The characters you’ve come to know—

469
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:54,872
this is where their real
reasons will come out.

470
00:25:54,872 --> 00:25:59,046
And I love that Lara’s books provided

471
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,605
the characters’ backstories.

472
00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:13,847
As the second book
of the phenomenal series opens,

473
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,038
watch out for the revelations

474
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:19,238
and the dark sides of each character.

475
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:22,738
I just really want to be grateful because
even before the show airs,

476
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:25,872
I already feel the love
from the community.

477
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:27,438
I feel so welcomed.

478
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:28,372
I feel like-

479
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:32,407
The support feels really strong

480
00:26:32,472 --> 00:26:36,638
even though we’re just
starting to shoot Book 2.

481
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:37,838
So I hope

482
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:42,613
when we finally air
and release the episodes,

483
00:26:42,638 --> 00:26:46,372
I hope the support burns even stronger,

484
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:50,272
because I really feel like this whole team—

485
00:26:50,272 --> 00:26:52,038
the cast, the crew,

486
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:53,838
the entire team of Book 2

487
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:55,071
is really just-

488
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:56,872
“Let’s do this!”

489
00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:58,538
Like we’re all in. Locked in-

490
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:01,372
to give you an even
bigger and better Book 2.

491
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:05,072
First of all, again, thank you.

492
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:06,838
Thank you so much to all of you

493
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:09,547
who supported us in Season one.

494
00:27:09,782 --> 00:27:11,982
If it weren’t for you,
we wouldn’t be here.

495
00:27:12,386 --> 00:27:14,086
I promise all of you that I’ll show

496
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:18,938
a different kind of Yuri here,

497
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,738
and I’ll do everything for Jay-jay.

498
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:24,113
I want to thank you all—

499
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:27,938
endless gratitude
to everyone who supported us

500
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,472
from the very beginning,
from the cast reveal until now

501
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:32,938
as we begin Season two.

502
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:34,838
Thank you so, so much.

503
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:36,772
I just want to say-

504
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:38,393
I know you always
hear this from me.

505
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:40,346
But we wouldn’t be where we are now

506
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:41,705
without your support.

507
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,213
Thank you so so much!

508
00:27:44,238 --> 00:27:45,972
You never let go.

509
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:47,947
Your love continues for us—

510
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:49,947
not just for me, but for all of us.

511
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:50,713
Thank you!

512
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,038
My promise to you, guys—

513
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:52,538
the viewers,

514
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:56,338
the fans who continue supporting us—

515
00:27:56,764 --> 00:27:58,538
is to give you my best

516
00:27:58,538 --> 00:28:02,698
and really try to improve
in every way I can.

517
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:05,089
Cut!

518
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:12,572
Listen. Listen.

519
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:17,172
Was my kick correct, bro?

520
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,944
Cut! Why are you laughing?

521
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,456
Cut!

522
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,138
She was doing this-

523
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:41,577
So overacting!
That’s not how it’s done!

524
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,282
All students who graduate

525
00:28:56,307 --> 00:28:58,005
must go through a retreat.

526
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,405
