1
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:56,666
In-young?

2
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:10,554
In-young...

3
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:50,488
In-young...

4
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:51,572
Ja-young!

5
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:54,742
You okay?

6
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:02,958
Your neck...

7
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,378
Did you scratch it?

8
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:13,678
Uh...

9
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:15,054
just...

10
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:18,057
Must've scratched it
in my sleep.

11
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,310
I'll grab some medicine.
Hang on.

12
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,477
It's fine...

13
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,326
(Gyesang High Punks
invites you to the meeting)

14
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,334
What the hell, Ja-young.
Did you just wake up?

15
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,794
Yeah...

16
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:29,379
Damn, you slept like a rock.

17
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,713
It's break, though.

18
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,215
Where is everyone?

19
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,509
Ugh, these jerks.
No one's logged in yet.

20
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:36,511
And I even washed
my hair this morning.

21
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:38,513
Sorry I'm late.

22
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:39,847
Wait, not everyone's here yet?

23
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,849
Yo, why are you so late?

24
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:42,767
We've been waiting.

25
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,060
Hey, Ja-young.

26
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,020
What happened to
your neck? You okay?

27
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:47,271
Yeah...

28
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:48,355
It's just...

29
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,274
Must've scratched it
in my sleep.

30
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:51,984
Geez... be careful.

31
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,695
Dong-joon, just got
back from training?

32
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:55,947
Yeah.

33
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,198
Where's that jerk
Moon Gi-ho?

34
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:59,450
- Hi.
- He's not here yet.

35
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:01,786
Ugh...

36
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,621
And he's the one
who planned this.

37
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:04,872
Yo!

38
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:07,083
How's everyone's
vacation going?

39
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,459
Dude, took you long enough.

40
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,378
How are you the last one here
when you called us first?

41
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:13,881
Sorry.

42
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:16,342
My deepest apologies
for my tardiness.

43
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,887
I was making some serious
preparations for you guys.

44
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,013
Like what?

45
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:22,806
You know, that thing
we were going to film.

46
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,684
Oh, for the 50 grand prize?

47
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:27,520
The YouTube contest.

48
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:31,232
I finally found
the perfect concept.

49
00:06:31,315 --> 00:06:32,108
Concept?

50
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,442
What kind of concept?

51
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:35,653
Just wait...

52
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,451
The door has opened.

53
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,202
It has opened.

54
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:45,120
It has opened.

55
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,957
Please come in.

56
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,333
Oh, crap!

57
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:52,712
Dude, th-th-that...

58
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,380
Look, look over there.

59
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,882
You...

60
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:57,675
There are letters appearing.

61
00:06:57,758 --> 00:06:59,135
Oh!

62
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,220
It looks like
the character for fire.

63
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:12,690
Wait.

64
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:18,905
Holy...

65
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:19,906
(Seance Method)

66
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,407
(Place a piece of paper with
a question in a bowl of water)

67
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,409
(The possessor stands
in the water with spirit)

68
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:24,577
Smell that, guys?

69
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,370
Smells like 50 grand to me.

70
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,499
This is so damn lame.

71
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,542
It's obviously fake.

72
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:35,671
Oh, come on,
you don't know crap.

73
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:36,755
Hey.

74
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,926
Fake or not, who cares?

75
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,385
We're making a fake one too.

76
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:42,261
Huh?

77
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:43,513
What do you mean?

78
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:44,972
Look, listen.

79
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:47,308
I got this link
from a subscriber.

80
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:49,310
This seance ritual
tells you the future.

81
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:51,103
Of course it's fake.

82
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:56,609
But we're going to
turn this seance thing

83
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,945
into a fake docu-style story.

84
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:03,741
High schoolers hold
a seance for answers...

85
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:05,159
And then they all vanish.

86
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,245
Totally realistic!

87
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,496
We're going to
make this go viral.

88
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:12,792
Sounds kinda legit.

89
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,627
(A seance that tells anything)

90
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,919
So?

91
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,464
Are we doing this?

92
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,259
What do you guys think?

93
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,553
Are we in?

94
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:28,766
I'm in.

95
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:30,726
Okay!

96
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:33,354
Mi-yeon, you're in, right?

97
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:34,939
Well...

98
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:36,231
For the prize money...

99
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:37,608
Hey.

100
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,443
Trust me, you're
in good hands.

101
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,904
And Ye-eun?

102
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,406
Yeah, sure.

103
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,991
Ja-young's in
so I'm in too.

104
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,078
But honestly...

105
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,414
I kinda wish
this stuff was real.

106
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:56,043
I'd ask to bring
my grandma back.

107
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:59,171
If it was real, that'd
be damn insane.

108
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:00,590
But...

109
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,341
This isn't about wishes.

110
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:03,593
It's about seeing the future.

111
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,760
Still...

112
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:06,553
It'd be cool if it was real.

113
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,390
What about our
big bat, Dong-joon?

114
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:10,850
Yeah, I'm in.

115
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,019
Okay! Let's do this.

116
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:15,896
Alright, so since Saturday's
the day after tomorrow,

117
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:16,939
let's meet up.

118
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:18,232
Let's go!

119
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,024
But...

120
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,403
Don't we need six people?

121
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:24,697
There's only five of us.

122
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:26,657
One...

123
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,243
two, three, four, five...

124
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:30,703
Yeah, it's five.
What's the problem?

125
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:34,331
The camera makes six, idiot.

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,669
Dammit, you're right.

127
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,838
You're such an idiot.

128
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,799
Figures, coming from you.

129
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,136
Ugh, dammit...

130
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:52,808
Okay.

131
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:53,893
My bad.

132
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,019
I forgot about
the possessed person.

133
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:59,607
Anyone know someone
dumb enough to join us?

134
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,066
Here, put this on.

135
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:05,821
Guys...

136
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:07,197
Hold up.

137
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,743
- Seo-woo...
- Is she going to take a dump?

138
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:12,411
Dude, why do you
talk like that?

139
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:14,413
We're filming something
fun together...

140
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,458
We're one person short.

141
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,292
Who is it?

142
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,919
Would you be up for it?

143
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,504
Sounds like Seo-woo.

144
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,630
I want to do it too! Sounds fun.

145
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,674
Seo-woo...

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,260
Oh...

147
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:30,638
Her stepmom's...

148
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:32,098
Moon Gi-ho!

149
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:33,223
Shut up.

150
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:38,604
Seo-woo's in.

151
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:39,939
Oh!

152
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:40,940
For real?

153
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,316
That's sick!

154
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,319
Ja-young coming in
clutch again.

155
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:48,489
Alright, team's all set.

156
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:49,364
Now...

157
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:51,701
What's that app for reading
Chinese characters?

158
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,285
Okpyeon?

159
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:54,120
Yeah, Okpyeon.

160
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:56,122
Everyone, download it.

161
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:57,874
If you mess up
reading the characters

162
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,166
and kill the vibe, I swear...

163
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:01,252
Dress code's school uniforms.

164
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:04,505
Big bat Dong-joon,
you wear your baseball uniform.

165
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:05,547
Got it?

166
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:07,883
Alright...

167
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:09,718
Now, scram.

168
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:31,240
(8/13 Day In-young disappeared)

169
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,238
Seriously?

170
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:15,409
Hey.

171
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:17,035
Stop filming me!

172
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,373
Stop messing around.

173
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:22,958
Hey, hurry up!

174
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,669
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go!

175
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:27,213
Yo!

176
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,381
Let's grab a shot in
the reflection before we go.

177
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:30,716
Yeah, sure!

178
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:32,802
- Alright, ready?
- Yeah.

179
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,220
One, two, three...

180
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,471
- It's a video.
- You tricked us!

181
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:37,723
I'll take it now.

182
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:39,725
Dong-joon, you're looking hot.

183
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:40,768
I'm always hot.

184
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:41,852
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's enough.

185
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:44,897
- We should tell her off.
- Let's go.

186
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,898
Right?

187
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,524
- So moody.
- She's prickly.

188
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:54,865
Hey!

189
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,452
- Ja-young!
- Yeah?

190
00:12:58,535 --> 00:12:59,870
Oh...

191
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:04,082
- She's coming.
- Let's go.

192
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:34,529
(The Ghost Game)

193
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,037
This place...

194
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,914
- Oh my god!
- What?

195
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:46,083
I thought
I saw something.

196
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,751
Like, a ghost
or something...

197
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:48,919
Oh, come on, Seo-woo.

198
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,672
Ah, where is it?

199
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,219
You know what?

200
00:13:57,928 --> 00:13:59,972
Back during
the Japanese occupation,

201
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,183
this area was once used
to transport

202
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:02,249
and bury the dead.

203
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:04,310
For real?

204
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:05,519
Yeah.

205
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:08,105
That's why they
call it Shigu-dong.

206
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:09,731
It means
'corpse transportation'.

207
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:13,861
Yo, hold up.

208
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:14,820
What?

209
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:17,072
- What?
- Looks like this is it.

210
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,156
Yeah? And?

211
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:21,451
I mean, I can't
say for sure, but...

212
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,704
An abandoned building...

213
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:25,205
Right here.

214
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,332
Where is it?

215
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:33,213
You're supposed to know.

216
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:34,923
Seriously...

217
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:37,718
Where is it?

218
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,887
- Be patient.
- It must be nearby.

219
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,680
- Where?
- Is it that place?

220
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:43,682
Let's try that place.

221
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:44,850
Okay.

222
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,685
We shouldn't just guess.

223
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,816
Huh?

224
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,067
There it is!

225
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:00,908
Wait...

226
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,409
We're actually going in?

227
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:05,037
- This is scary.
- Yo, what do you think?

228
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,372
Creepy as hell, right?

229
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:07,539
It might collapse.

230
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:09,917
Yeah, it's got the vibes.

231
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,251
Whoa...

232
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:13,111
- We're so doomed.
- Why is it so dark?

233
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,130
Alright, we're set, yeah?

234
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:16,548
- There's...
- Let's go in.

235
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:17,925
no way someone
actually lives here.

236
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:19,843
Keep your flashlight on.

237
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:21,971
Don't worry.
Just look ahead.

238
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,138
Let's go.

239
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:41,615
Stop it.

240
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:42,950
This is freaking me out...

241
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:44,284
Move slowly.

242
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,286
We'll get a million
views for sure.

243
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:49,414
Be careful.

244
00:15:57,964 --> 00:15:59,466
Ja-young,
watch your step.

245
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:05,055
Wait a sec...

246
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:15,816
Guys...

247
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,234
Look at this.

248
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:23,990
Damn...

249
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:27,244
This is the exact ritual symbol
for tonight.

250
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,749
So we really found
the right place.

251
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,922
This stuff gives me chills.

252
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,759
Are seances real?

253
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:44,511
If it is, then holy crap,
this is insane.

254
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:47,430
Come on, let's go.

255
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,615
Whoa...
what the hell is this?

256
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,451
Are we at
the right place?

257
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,747
What is this?

258
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:19,004
Ugh, nasty water...

259
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,505
Is this the right way?

260
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,509
This is it.

261
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:38,982
Ugh, it stinks...

262
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:41,443
Hey, let's just film
something else.

263
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:43,195
Dude, it smells so bad.

264
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:44,404
Can't we film something else?

265
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:46,406
I literally can't breathe.

266
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:47,699
Yo.

267
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:49,618
You guys are so damn annoying.

268
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:51,078
We came all this way.

269
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:53,580
What else are
we supposed to do?

270
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,497
Huh?

271
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,792
Still...

272
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:00,128
Let's do it.

273
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:04,633
Gi-ho's right.
We're already here.

274
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,636
Yeah.

275
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,431
Honestly, we're not going to find

276
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:10,639
a better concept than this.

277
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:12,641
We doing this?

278
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:13,934
Yeah.

279
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:23,443
You know...

280
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:25,404
they say the stronger
the stench,

281
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:27,822
the more spirits gather
in a place like this.

282
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:30,825
This is totally going to be a hit.
Don't you think?

283
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,598
It's okay.

284
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:56,977
What are you doing?

285
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,733
The lights still work, huh?

286
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,532
What is all this?

287
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:19,333
This looks like traces
of an actual ritual.

288
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,251
- Huh?
- What?

289
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,545
Seeing it in real life
is creepy as hell.

290
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:24,922
I know.

291
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:26,464
Not that scary.

292
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:30,135
This is damn...

293
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:34,014
I mean, this is
seriously creepy.

294
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:35,598
What are these pillars for?

295
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,186
Maybe they marked
the water levels?

296
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:41,980
Aren't those usually
on the walls, though?

297
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:49,154
What are you doing?

298
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:53,325
Damn.

299
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,410
It's actually here.

300
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:57,412
What is?

301
00:19:57,954 --> 00:19:59,039
I mean...

302
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:01,875
I was told we had to use
this water for the ritual.

303
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,251
I thought that was total crap.

304
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:05,337
What even is this?

305
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,463
Souls.

306
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:08,257
- Souls?
- Yeah.

307
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,925
Back in the Japanese
occupation era,

308
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,137
all of northern Seoul's water was
processed

309
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,011
right here in this reservoir.

310
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:14,179
Because of that...

311
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:16,265
all sorts of water
ghosts got sucked

312
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,516
through the sewers
and ended up here.

313
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:20,935
Ghosts?
Yeah, right...

314
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:25,106
Yo.

315
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:26,983
Stop trying to pick apart
everything I say.

316
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,239
As you can see...

317
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:34,574
the reservoir's completely
dried up, right?

318
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:36,451
But this black water here...

319
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:39,454
is keeping these souls trapped
so they can't escape.

320
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,957
Ugh... That's creepy.

321
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,086
How deep is it?

322
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,422
These souls are
so concentrated

323
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:49,591
that they absorb the light,

324
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:50,674
making it look deep.

325
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:53,760
But really, it's just
this shallow.

326
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:58,975
If you think about it,

327
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,475
this is basically ghost juice.

328
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,854
Gi-ho, is any of this
actually real?

329
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:04,771
Of course!

330
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:06,523
The account owner
told me directly...

331
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:08,149
You really buy that?

332
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,529
For god's sake...

333
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:13,905
Yo!

334
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:16,658
Why do you always
have to kill the mood?

335
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:18,285
- Cut it out.
- I was just saying...

336
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:20,579
Who here actually thinks
this ritual is real?

337
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:22,497
I'm just trying to
make a solid video.

338
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,999
So we can win that
damn prize money!

339
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,291
Gi-ho!

340
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:28,795
Why are you so pissed?

341
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:30,880
We need someone
playing the skeptic.

342
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:35,969
But Mi-yeon, you should stop
being so negative.

343
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:37,887
Alright.

344
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:39,889
My bad.

345
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:45,395
Okay, okay.

346
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:48,273
So, should we run it again?

347
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:49,274
Huh?

348
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,123
Yeah, looks good.

349
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:06,791
Hold on... just a little more.

350
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,335
It's coming out well.

351
00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:15,175
What's that?

352
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:16,510
Is that blood?

353
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:18,345
Yeah.
Cow blood.

354
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:20,805
Damn, this guy's legit.

355
00:22:22,223 --> 00:22:24,559
You need to go all out
if you want to blow up on YouTube.

356
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,103
Ye-eun...

357
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:29,647
Come with me for a sec.

358
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:34,736
Gi-ho!

359
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:35,779
Yo, what the hell?
Are you crazy?

360
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:37,780
Ugh, just chill for a sec.

361
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:40,033
Everyone,

362
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:42,786
this is how you mix
human blood with cow blood

363
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:45,455
to summon an even
stronger spirit.

364
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:53,964
Cut.

365
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:56,424
Gi-ho! Is your hand okay?

366
00:22:58,426 --> 00:23:00,386
Of course!

367
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:05,475
Geez, I totally thought
it was real!

368
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:07,889
You crazy jerk!
You scared the hell out of me!

369
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,647
You think I'd actually
cut myself?

370
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,274
I even prepped the paper with
the appearing Chinese characters.

371
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:20,240
This is a reversed pentagram.

372
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:23,159
It's a symbol for
summoning demons.

373
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,627
Ah, damn, this is exhausting.

374
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,795
Ugh, it stinks.

375
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:35,755
- You're really committed to this.
- Hand me my phone.

376
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,341
Can't you draw it properly?

377
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,386
What? It looks damn good.

378
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:42,637
Whatever.

379
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,975
Okay! I think we've
got the basics down,

380
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,643
so let's prep the next part.

381
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:50,270
Ugh, it's so hot.

382
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:51,354
What do we do next?

383
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:52,814
I'll give you guys paper.

384
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:55,317
Write down the questions
you've always wanted to ask.

385
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,444
- What should I write?
- What are these?

386
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:58,737
Bowls.

387
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,405
Don't be so thorough.

388
00:24:00,488 --> 00:24:02,908
- Why did you bring these?
- Bring what?

389
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:04,242
What is this?

390
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,036
Don't touch it.

391
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,287
Guys.

392
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:10,832
What if...

393
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,879
We actually try this for real?

394
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,339
Huh?

395
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,756
What are you saying?

396
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,759
You serious?

397
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,220
What if this is real?

398
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:27,265
Let's actually try it once.

399
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:29,058
If nothing happens,
we'll do it your way.

400
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:36,190
I mean...

401
00:24:36,774 --> 00:24:38,776
if it works for real,
that'd be next-level.

402
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:40,695
So what do we do?

403
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:42,155
want to try it for real?

404
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:48,453
I'm in.

405
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,207
What about the vessel?

406
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:55,918
Who's going to do it?

407
00:25:01,591 --> 00:25:02,925
Why are you looking at me?

408
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,305
Ah, come on.

409
00:25:07,388 --> 00:25:08,681
I'll do it.

410
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:13,770
I actually had something
I wanted to ask.

411
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:15,897
Let's do it, then.

412
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:18,984
Yeah, why not? Let's try.

413
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,610
Whatever.

414
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,404
It reeks in here anyway.

415
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,405
Okay!

416
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,407
Then I'll give you guys...

417
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,492
paper to write
your questions on.

418
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,004
Sis!

419
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:40,297
Are you insane?

420
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,339
What's wrong?

421
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:42,257
Ja-young!

422
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,717
Oh...

423
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,759
- Oh my god...
- It's fine.

424
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,052
What the hell?

425
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:48,179
We have to do this for real.

426
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,391
Alright!

427
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:55,478
Everyone, grab
a piece of paper and a bowl.

428
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:57,438
Write down your questions.

429
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,108
And don't write
anything dumb, got it?

430
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,401
Like I'd be as dumb as you.

431
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:03,862
Ja-young, grab one too.

432
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:05,154
Seo-woo
you take one as well.

433
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:10,535
Once it's past midnight,
we're starting,

434
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,495
so think carefully
about what you want to ask.

435
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:27,929
(Will I be able to
see my sister again?)

436
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:40,148
You don't have to do this
if you're scared.

437
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:43,401
No, I want to do it.

438
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:57,623
This is your talisman.

439
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:05,799
This is the first time
you've given me a present.

440
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:07,216
Thanks!

441
00:27:08,718 --> 00:27:09,969
Don't worry.

442
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:13,515
Questioners.

443
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:17,435
Fill your bowls with
spirit-infused water.

444
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:27,904
And sit at the star's points.

445
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:30,490
In the center of the star,

446
00:27:30,573 --> 00:27:33,618
the vessel stands
with their face covered.

447
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,257
Questioners place a lit candle

448
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,963
next to their bowl.

449
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:47,967
Then, place the question paper
in the water,

450
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,760
facing down.

451
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:53,096
The vessel...

452
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:56,557
must step barefoot
into the spirit water.

453
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:59,310
Slowly... take it slow.

454
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:02,939
To end the possession...

455
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:05,692
Before removing the bag,

456
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:09,320
you must say
'Please leave.'

457
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:11,489
And each person must leave

458
00:28:11,572 --> 00:28:14,325
in the order they
got their answers.

459
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,662
Now, all together...

460
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:24,002
The door has opened.

461
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:25,754
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

462
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,255
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

463
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,381
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

464
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:30,633
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

465
00:28:30,716 --> 00:28:32,260
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

466
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:33,427
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

467
00:28:34,095 --> 00:28:35,513
- Please come in.
- Please come in.

468
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,627
Yo.

469
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:09,755
Guess we're just faking it.

470
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:36,783
Do you see that?

471
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:37,867
Huh?

472
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:39,660
See what?

473
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:26,875
Seo-woo...

474
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,125
Stay put.

475
00:30:40,346 --> 00:30:42,890
Holy... this is
so insane.

476
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:46,852
What if something
goes wrong?

477
00:30:47,895 --> 00:30:49,355
Stay still.

478
00:31:28,502 --> 00:31:30,649
(Wrong, Bu)

479
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:46,619
(Right, Ga)

480
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:09,309
(Flower, Young)

481
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:24,909
(Right, Ga)

482
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,929
(Right, Ga)

483
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,899
Six hundred sixty-two.

484
00:32:58,567 --> 00:32:59,985
Six hundred sixty-three.

485
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,030
Six hundred sixty-four.

486
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,366
Six hundred sixty-five.

487
00:33:12,498 --> 00:33:13,833
Six hundred sixty-six.

488
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:50,828
Huh?

489
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:54,039
What's going on?

490
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:32,620
Stop her now!

491
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:33,537
Seo-woo!

492
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:35,581
Seo-woo...

493
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:37,041
- Seo-woo...
- Seo-woo...

494
00:34:37,124 --> 00:34:38,834
- Seo-woo.
- Seo-woo!

495
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:41,545
Seo-woo.

496
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:43,464
Seo-woo.

497
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:44,465
- Seo-woo.
- Seo-woo.

498
00:34:44,548 --> 00:34:45,966
- Seo-woo!
- Seo-woo.

499
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,053
What do we do now?

500
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:52,765
Ugh, stop filming
and do something!

501
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:53,641
Seo-woo...

502
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,143
What the hell is this?

503
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:58,771
What's this?

504
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:00,314
What happened?

505
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:02,191
What the hell...

506
00:35:05,945 --> 00:35:08,072
We need to call 911.

507
00:35:08,155 --> 00:35:09,279
You're right.

508
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:10,658
Seo-woo...

509
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:12,201
(True story! Seance teaser
Upload)

510
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:13,286
This is insane.

511
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:15,788
Guys, holy crap!
This is insane!

512
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:16,581
Seriously...

513
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:18,040
I didn't think we'd get
something this good!

514
00:35:18,123 --> 00:35:19,167
You sick jerk.

515
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,751
Seo-woo's like this

516
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:22,503
and all you care about
is your damn video?

517
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:23,754
Guys...

518
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:27,216
There's no signal.

519
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,676
Bullcrap, it was working
just fine a minute ago.

520
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,178
I'm telling you,
there's no signal!

521
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:32,763
What the hell is going on?

522
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:44,900
Dammit...

523
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,411
What the hell are you doing?

524
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:56,579
It won't open!

525
00:35:56,662 --> 00:35:57,705
Move.

526
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:02,876
Hurry up and open it.

527
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,339
Holy...

528
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:07,840
It won't open.

529
00:36:17,683 --> 00:36:19,184
Step aside.

530
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,527
There.

531
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:32,531
- Huh?
- Wait...

532
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:33,991
What's wrong with this door?

533
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:38,078
Dammit, it's just a decoration!

534
00:36:39,246 --> 00:36:40,331
Damn it, I knew
something felt off.

535
00:36:40,414 --> 00:36:41,707
Then what do we do now?

536
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,542
How the hell do
we open this door?

537
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,628
We're trapped.

538
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:51,967
Damn it, what do we do now?

539
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:59,433
Why won't it open?

540
00:37:56,824 --> 00:37:58,242
Yo!

541
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:00,285
What the heck are you doing?

542
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,626
We have to...

543
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:09,962
get out...

544
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:12,423
What?

545
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:16,176
Are you okay?

546
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,855
I'm fine.

547
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,367
(100,000 views)

548
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,160
The signal's back!

549
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:44,955
Call for help now.

550
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,791
It's gone again.

551
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:53,672
It connects for a second
and then cuts off.

552
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:55,048
I'm fine.

553
00:38:57,217 --> 00:38:58,802
What is up with her?

554
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:00,471
I'm fine.

555
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,431
I'm fine.

556
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,437
Hey, Seo Mi-yeon...

557
00:39:09,396 --> 00:39:10,689
Mi-yeon...

558
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,858
Hey...

559
00:39:13,942 --> 00:39:15,486
Mi-yeon...

560
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:23,327
What's wrong with you?

561
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,122
Hey, Mi-yeon...

562
00:39:31,293 --> 00:39:33,212
I'm fine!

563
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,351
Mi-yeon.

564
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:50,104
Seo Mi-yeon.

565
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,188
Hey.

566
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:52,273
Hey, Mi-yeon
what the hell?

567
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,774
Hey, hey...

568
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:55,192
What the hell are you doing?

569
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:56,777
- Stop!
- Hey.

570
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:08,872
Hey...

571
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:18,173
We have to go.

572
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:24,305
- We have to kill her.
- Okay.

573
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,764
Just put that down first...

574
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:27,266
We have to kill her.

575
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,059
What?

576
00:40:31,186 --> 00:40:32,271
We have to kill her.

577
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:33,939
We have to kill her.

578
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:36,441
We have to kill her.

579
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:45,534
Hey...

580
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:46,410
I told you we
have to kill her.

581
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:47,911
Hey, put that down.

582
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,501
I told you we
have to kill her.

583
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,798
Put it down.

584
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,219
Hey, hey!

585
00:41:03,302 --> 00:41:04,470
Hey!

586
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:06,388
What the heck is
wrong with you?

587
00:41:06,471 --> 00:41:07,848
What the heck?

588
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,528
Stop it!

589
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:29,995
She's not even
your real sister.

590
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:35,584
Hey!

591
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:49,890
What...

592
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,933
What the heck
did you just do?

593
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,438
Hey!

594
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,073
Yo...

595
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,450
What's wrong with her?

596
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:09,493
Yo! What the hell is
wrong with her?

597
00:42:09,576 --> 00:42:10,702
Wait...

598
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:50,034
What do I do...

599
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:51,743
What do I do...

600
00:43:06,925 --> 00:43:08,594
Don't beat yourself
up too much.

601
00:43:08,677 --> 00:43:10,971
It was an accident.
You were trying to save Seo-woo.

602
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:12,389
If you hadn't,
Seo-woo would be dead.

603
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:14,058
That wasn't an accident.
It was murder.

604
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:16,143
I don't remember!

605
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,269
Cut the act.

606
00:43:18,854 --> 00:43:19,897
Yo, Dong-joon.

607
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,608
Why the heck would I be acting,
you prick?

608
00:43:22,691 --> 00:43:24,318
I really don't remember.

609
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,070
Just believe me...

610
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:27,905
Why the heck would I kill Mi-yeon
just to save Seo-woo?

611
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:29,698
Maybe you wanted to.

612
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,201
What?

613
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:35,787
What the heck did you just say,
you piece of crap?

614
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:37,956
This is Mi-yeon's question.

615
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:41,589
(Will I be able to
escape Moon Gi-ho?)

616
00:43:44,963 --> 00:43:46,757
You really killed her
over this?

617
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:49,802
Erase it now.

618
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:51,511
You already got the answers!

619
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:53,222
Oh, come on.

620
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:56,183
You think this ends
with a couple of test answers?

621
00:43:56,725 --> 00:43:57,810
Huh?

622
00:43:57,893 --> 00:43:59,519
Mi-yeon, should I just...

623
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,606
Should I tell everyone

624
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:03,023
you're hooking up
with the teacher?

625
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:04,857
That you only got top mark

626
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,068
because you were
sleeping with her?

627
00:44:14,326 --> 00:44:15,411
Give me that.

628
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:18,205
I can't keep feeding you
answers like this! Dammit!

629
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,456
Hey.

630
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:22,042
If this gets out, I'll never
get into Seoul National.

631
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:23,293
Yeah?

632
00:44:24,044 --> 00:44:26,421
You should've thought of that
before fooling around.

633
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:30,968
Anyway...

634
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:32,886
I'm counting on you
for tomorrow's exam.

635
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,932
Let's just die together.

636
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:39,893
I'll tell them everything.

637
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,064
About your little
spy cam account.

638
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,817
I'll tell them, you prick.

639
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,859
(Spy cam account
300 videos 80 bucks)

640
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,660
Yeah...

641
00:44:57,452 --> 00:44:58,495
I threatened her, but...

642
00:44:58,578 --> 00:45:01,874
You dragged us here
just to kill Mi-yeon.

643
00:45:01,957 --> 00:45:03,458
Dammit... seriously!

644
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:06,044
No...

645
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:07,671
That's not true.

646
00:45:07,754 --> 00:45:10,549
The last thing I remember is
Mi-yeon going after Seo-woo.

647
00:45:10,632 --> 00:45:11,675
Please...

648
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:13,969
just hear me out!

649
00:45:15,387 --> 00:45:17,055
You have to
believe me this time.

650
00:45:17,138 --> 00:45:18,348
Okay?

651
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:19,516
You don't remember?

652
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,686
Then let's check
the damn phone.

653
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:31,319
What is this?

654
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:34,322
This...

655
00:45:34,823 --> 00:45:36,199
this is supposed to be me?

656
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:38,869
No way.

657
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:41,413
No, this isn't me, guys.

658
00:45:41,496 --> 00:45:42,539
What do you mean?

659
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:43,582
That's you.

660
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:44,791
No, I mean...

661
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:46,084
Look.

662
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:47,211
I...

663
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:48,587
No, this person...

664
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,921
he's limping.

665
00:45:50,422 --> 00:45:51,548
But I...

666
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:55,302
I walk just fine.

667
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,512
You hurt your leg, remember?

668
00:45:56,595 --> 00:45:59,472
Maybe you limp
when you run.

669
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:01,141
Yo...

670
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:03,393
Have you ever seen me
limp when I run?

671
00:46:03,476 --> 00:46:04,436
Huh?

672
00:46:16,156 --> 00:46:17,282
Anyway...

673
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:19,034
it's not me.

674
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:21,161
Look!

675
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:22,037
You see?

676
00:46:23,246 --> 00:46:24,246
Huh?

677
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,249
What the hell?

678
00:46:34,257 --> 00:46:35,383
What's wrong with him?

679
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:43,725
Let go.

680
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,227
Let go, dammit!

681
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,699
Mi-yeon's grabbing my leg!

682
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:10,419
What's just happened?

683
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:11,586
Guys...

684
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:20,012
Dong-joon.

685
00:47:20,095 --> 00:47:21,513
Oh, hey.

686
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,758
Where the hell did he go?

687
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,408
'See you soon'?

688
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,660
Was that always there?

689
00:48:26,828 --> 00:48:28,163
I don't know.

690
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:33,937
Die! Die!

691
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,648
Die! Die! Die! Die!

692
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:38,483
What the hell is
wrong with him?

693
00:49:38,566 --> 00:49:39,651
Die! Die!

694
00:49:39,734 --> 00:49:42,239
- Is your arm okay?
- Yeah.

695
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:44,697
I'm sorry.

696
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,285
I shouldn't have said
we should do it for real.

697
00:49:51,454 --> 00:49:52,580
No...

698
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:54,749
We all agreed to this.

699
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:57,877
What do we do now?

700
00:50:19,732 --> 00:50:21,067
Seo-woo!

701
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:22,778
- Seo-woo!
- Seo-woo!

702
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:23,653
- Are you okay?
- Seo-woo.

703
00:50:23,736 --> 00:50:25,405
Seo-woo, snap out of it!

704
00:50:25,488 --> 00:50:26,740
Seo-woo...

705
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:27,783
Guys...

706
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:29,367
Look at this.

707
00:50:31,452 --> 00:50:33,288
It's fading.

708
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:39,794
We have to do it again.

709
00:50:41,379 --> 00:50:42,422
Do what?

710
00:50:43,965 --> 00:50:45,091
I think...

711
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:48,094
something went wrong
during the seance.

712
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,811
The door has opened.

713
00:50:55,894 --> 00:50:58,271
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

714
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,565
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

715
00:51:00,648 --> 00:51:03,318
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

716
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,570
What is this?

717
00:51:05,653 --> 00:51:08,865
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

718
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:11,910
Stop her now!

719
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:13,370
Seo-woo!

720
00:51:13,453 --> 00:51:14,746
Seo-woo!

721
00:51:16,497 --> 00:51:18,291
We're cursed.

722
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:20,668
Because we broke the rules.

723
00:51:21,502 --> 00:51:22,629
Rules?

724
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,842
We were supposed to leave
in the order we got our answers.

725
00:51:30,386 --> 00:51:32,430
But Ye-eun left first.

726
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,225
And...

727
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:42,023
We just took it off.

728
00:51:44,525 --> 00:51:46,152
Then what do we do?

729
00:51:47,987 --> 00:51:50,448
We never said,
"Please leave."

730
00:51:52,158 --> 00:51:54,285
That means it's not over yet.

731
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,038
We have to do it again.

732
00:51:57,956 --> 00:51:58,998
But...

733
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:02,001
Mi-yeon is dead.

734
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,005
Her body is still here...

735
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:10,301
Let's try it again.

736
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,107
You're all going to die.

737
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,525
You're all going to die.

738
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:27,026
You're all going to die.

739
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,280
Everyone dies eventually.

740
00:52:30,822 --> 00:52:33,074
But not here.
Not us.

741
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:43,460
(Will my video reach 1M views?)

742
00:52:43,543 --> 00:52:45,253
Pathetic jerk.

743
00:52:50,758 --> 00:52:52,260
- The door...
- The door...

744
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:54,429
- has opened.
- has opened.

745
00:52:54,512 --> 00:52:56,014
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

746
00:52:56,097 --> 00:52:57,641
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

747
00:52:57,724 --> 00:52:59,309
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

748
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:00,936
- It has opened.
- It has opened.

749
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:02,520
It has opened.

750
00:53:03,688 --> 00:53:05,189
Please come in.

751
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:20,056
It worked.

752
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,498
(Right, Ga)

753
00:54:31,692 --> 00:54:33,152
It's the same.

754
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:39,409
Me too.

755
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:42,870
Same here.

756
00:54:46,374 --> 00:54:48,418
Now, all together...

757
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:50,086
- Please leave.
- Seriously?

758
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,341
Do I really have to leave?

759
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:58,344
Huh?

760
00:55:04,976 --> 00:55:06,185
Ja-young.

761
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,318
Ja-young.

762
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:16,154
Ja-young.

763
00:55:17,613 --> 00:55:18,948
In-young?

764
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:23,286
Should I really go?

765
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:25,913
Ja-young...

766
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:32,420
Ja-young!

767
00:55:33,754 --> 00:55:34,589
Ja-young!

768
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,009
We have to end this now!

769
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:45,809
Ja-young!

770
00:55:45,892 --> 00:55:47,226
See you later.

771
00:55:53,274 --> 00:55:54,609
Ja-young!

772
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:56,694
Snap out of it
Park Ja-young!

773
00:55:56,777 --> 00:55:57,737
That's not your sister.

774
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,363
We have to end this now!

775
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:07,205
Please leave.

776
00:56:07,288 --> 00:56:08,539
- Please leave.
- Please leave.

777
00:56:09,207 --> 00:56:10,750
- Please leave.
- Please leave.

778
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:13,086
- Please leave.
- Please leave.

779
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,879
- Please leave.
- Please leave.

780
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,881
- Please leave.
- Please leave.

781
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:19,258
- Please leave.
- Please leave.

782
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,599
Mi-yeon first.

783
00:56:50,498 --> 00:56:52,041
Is it over?

784
00:56:52,124 --> 00:56:53,376
I think so...

785
00:56:57,338 --> 00:56:59,048
I think it worked.

786
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:08,766
That's Gi-ho's, isn't it?

787
00:57:08,849 --> 00:57:09,601
It's working.

788
00:57:09,684 --> 00:57:11,435
What?
Is there a signal?

789
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:20,487
Help! We're trapped!

790
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,780
This is 911.
What's your location?

791
00:57:22,863 --> 00:57:24,157
Shigu-dong redevelopment zone,

792
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,658
underground, 235.

793
00:57:26,826 --> 00:57:28,578
We'll be right there.

794
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:30,955
Yes. Please hurry!

795
00:57:31,038 --> 00:57:33,124
Okay, Dong-joon.

796
00:57:39,046 --> 00:57:40,089
What?

797
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:43,176
Dong-joon...

798
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,343
What is it?

799
00:57:45,052 --> 00:57:46,220
No, it's nothing.

800
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:50,849
(No service)

801
00:58:09,952 --> 00:58:11,162
Dong-joon...

802
00:58:12,747 --> 00:58:13,748
Yeah.

803
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:22,965
Can I stay here for a bit?

804
00:58:23,758 --> 00:58:24,800
Sure.

805
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:26,886
I had a nightmare.

806
00:58:35,227 --> 00:58:36,562
Ja-young.

807
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:42,234
We might never
get out of here.

808
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,907
So I just want to
say something.

809
00:58:52,745 --> 00:58:53,788
Say what?

810
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,099
(I like you)

811
00:59:21,229 --> 00:59:22,979
(Me too)

812
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:44,213
Let's escape,
no matter what.

813
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:45,881
Okay.

814
01:00:11,365 --> 01:00:12,700
Guys, I'm turning
the lights on.

815
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:22,960
Moon Gi-ho.

816
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,717
Hey, Moon Gi-ho.

817
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,177
Wake up.

818
01:00:39,894 --> 01:00:41,812
What happened?

819
01:01:02,124 --> 01:01:04,084
What's Seo-woo doing?

820
01:01:10,174 --> 01:01:11,718
Seo-woo...

821
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:12,718
Why...

822
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,349
Why...

823
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,649
Why isn't it over?

824
01:01:51,048 --> 01:01:53,259
It's still not over?

825
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,389
Dammit, why isn't it over!

826
01:02:00,307 --> 01:02:01,726
Help!

827
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:03,603
Please help!

828
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,188
Dammit, open the door!

829
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:38,929
What the...

830
01:02:47,521 --> 01:02:48,564
Hey...

831
01:02:49,106 --> 01:02:50,524
- Ye-eun...
- Hey...

832
01:03:01,952 --> 01:03:03,454
- Ye-eun!
- Ye-eun!

833
01:03:05,998 --> 01:03:07,542
Hey, hey!

834
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:08,543
Hey, Ji Ye-eun!

835
01:03:08,626 --> 01:03:09,835
Get out of there!

836
01:03:11,837 --> 01:03:12,963
Hey!

837
01:03:13,547 --> 01:03:14,549
Ye-eun!

838
01:03:14,632 --> 01:03:16,050
- Hey!
- Ye-eun!

839
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:18,010
- Hey, get up.
- Ye-eun!

840
01:03:18,093 --> 01:03:19,386
Get out of there!

841
01:03:20,387 --> 01:03:21,305
Come on!

842
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,104
Are you okay?

843
01:03:43,661 --> 01:03:46,538
Someone pulled me under...

844
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:55,255
We definitely finished
the ritual properly.

845
01:03:57,007 --> 01:03:59,176
Why the hell is this
still happening to us?

846
01:04:01,345 --> 01:04:03,097
What about the call?

847
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,628
The prophecy came true.

848
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,426
Moon Gi-ho's
prophecy came true.

849
01:04:44,972 --> 01:04:46,807
A million views.

850
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:51,270
Mi-yeon's prophecy
came true, too.

851
01:04:51,353 --> 01:04:53,230
Not being able to
escape Moon Gi-ho.

852
01:04:59,486 --> 01:05:01,322
Seo Mi-yeon and
Moon Gi-ho...

853
01:05:01,405 --> 01:05:03,282
They both died after
their prophecies came true.

854
01:05:06,994 --> 01:05:10,080
I think that's what
causes death.

855
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:16,391
(Flower, Young)

856
01:05:20,924 --> 01:05:21,801
Ja-young...

857
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:22,926
This...

858
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:30,019
(Does Ja-young like me?)

859
01:05:35,856 --> 01:05:37,524
I have no regrets.

860
01:05:39,234 --> 01:05:42,237
If I end up dying next...

861
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:44,823
No.

862
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,326
Don't say that.

863
01:05:48,494 --> 01:05:49,953
We can stop this.

864
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,585
Don't give up,
Dong-joon.

865
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:19,608
(Who does Dong-joon like?)

866
01:06:20,608 --> 01:06:25,029
(Flower, Young)

867
01:06:30,285 --> 01:06:31,620
Ye-eun...

868
01:06:33,038 --> 01:06:35,124
I really don't care, okay?

869
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:41,005
Whether the person I like
ends up with my friend...

870
01:06:41,088 --> 01:06:43,632
or my friend ends up
with the person I like.

871
01:06:43,715 --> 01:06:46,093
I really don't care.

872
01:06:50,097 --> 01:06:51,807
But I don't want to die.

873
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,060
What?

874
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,439
I don't want to die.

875
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,442
I don't want to go to hell.

876
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:03,652
I don't want to end like this!

877
01:07:03,735 --> 01:07:05,654
Hey...

878
01:07:07,573 --> 01:07:08,866
Dong-joon.

879
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:13,329
If that wench dies,
we can live, right?

880
01:07:13,412 --> 01:07:14,371
Hey...

881
01:07:14,454 --> 01:07:15,956
What the hell
are you saying?

882
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:17,875
I'll forgive you.

883
01:07:19,793 --> 01:07:21,712
If she dies.

884
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:27,634
Why are you doing
this, Ye-eun?

885
01:07:39,438 --> 01:07:41,607
You damn wench...

886
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,609
Just go to hell.

887
01:07:44,735 --> 01:07:46,070
Dong-joon.

888
01:07:46,153 --> 01:07:47,113
Let go!

889
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,115
Dammit! Let me go!

890
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,782
You want to die too?

891
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:53,410
Let go! Crap!

892
01:07:53,493 --> 01:07:54,703
Let go!

893
01:07:54,786 --> 01:07:56,038
I said let go!

894
01:07:56,914 --> 01:07:58,040
Dammit! Let go!

895
01:07:58,123 --> 01:07:59,666
I said let go!

896
01:08:01,376 --> 01:08:03,295
Let go of me. Dammit!

897
01:08:04,004 --> 01:08:05,548
You dirty skanks.

898
01:08:05,631 --> 01:08:08,843
All you two do is
smooch around!

899
01:08:08,926 --> 01:08:10,386
Let me out of this!

900
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:11,804
You damn wenches!

901
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:14,681
Hey, prick, let me go!

902
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,476
Dammit!

903
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:18,560
I said let go!

904
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,364
Dammit... Untie me!

905
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:32,283
You damn wenches!

906
01:08:32,366 --> 01:08:33,242
I'm sorry!

907
01:08:33,325 --> 01:08:34,952
I messed up!
I'm sorry.

908
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:36,745
Please, just untie me!

909
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,254
What the hell?

910
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:11,071
Be careful.

911
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:15,329
(Death, Sa)

912
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:35,846
I'll check this way.

913
01:10:10,964 --> 01:10:12,132
Ja-young.

914
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:16,679
The four rooms
are exactly the same.

915
01:10:16,762 --> 01:10:17,846
In the corners...

916
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:19,139
Death?

917
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,988
The puddle and
the reservoir...

918
01:10:35,614 --> 01:10:37,574
They have the same shape.

919
01:10:38,992 --> 01:10:40,827
Each corner has...

920
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:42,954
the death character.

921
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:48,043
This might not be a reservoir.

922
01:10:48,126 --> 01:10:49,252
What?

923
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,924
It was built for the ritual
from the start.

924
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:34,881
Six hundred sixty-six.

925
01:11:51,857 --> 01:11:54,484
When five prophecies
are fulfilled...

926
01:11:55,068 --> 01:11:57,487
and five lives are taken...

927
01:11:58,697 --> 01:12:00,699
a body is bestowed?

928
01:12:07,873 --> 01:12:09,458
Ja-young...

929
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:11,418
Ja-young!

930
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:13,670
Ja-young.

931
01:12:18,592 --> 01:12:19,426
Ja-young...

932
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,012
Ja-young...

933
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:31,646
Ja-young...

934
01:13:05,305 --> 01:13:06,807
Dong-joon.

935
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,184
Do you want to
try this together?

936
01:13:09,267 --> 01:13:11,770
Gi-ho wants to do this
and is gathering people.

937
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:14,397
I thought it'd be good
if we did it together.

(2024 YouTube Content Contest)

939
01:13:31,456 --> 01:13:35,126
Moon Gi-ho didn't
gather everyone.

940
01:13:36,253 --> 01:13:37,087
It was you.

941
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,672
Crap...

942
01:13:45,971 --> 01:13:47,722
But why us?

943
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,106
Because I promised
to protect my sister.

944
01:13:56,189 --> 01:13:58,608
Running away?
Get back here.

945
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,864
Did you just splash me?

946
01:14:03,947 --> 01:14:05,156
Get back here.

947
01:14:05,824 --> 01:14:08,159
You really think
I can't catch you?

948
01:14:08,952 --> 01:14:11,038
Look. Mine's bigger.

949
01:14:11,121 --> 01:14:12,372
No, mine's bigger!

950
01:14:12,455 --> 01:14:14,207
No way, mine's bigger.

951
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:16,710
It was bigger earlier.

952
01:14:16,793 --> 01:14:18,253
Because...

953
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,506
I'm the big sis.

954
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,882
Ugh, you always say that.

955
01:14:25,218 --> 01:14:26,929
Then do you want
to be the big sis?

956
01:14:27,012 --> 01:14:28,972
But a big sis has to protect
her younger sibling.

957
01:14:29,055 --> 01:14:30,766
Yeah, I'll be the big sis.

958
01:14:30,849 --> 01:14:33,101
And I'll protect you forever.

959
01:14:33,184 --> 01:14:34,895
Promise me.

960
01:14:34,978 --> 01:14:36,355
I promise!

961
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:39,358
Even when we're old ladies,
I'll protect you.

962
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:41,443
From now on,
I'm the big sis.

963
01:14:42,986 --> 01:14:45,614
Losing my sister
ruined my life.

964
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,742
But you guys were
always laughing.

965
01:14:49,242 --> 01:14:51,244
As if you were
mocking me.

966
01:14:55,832 --> 01:14:58,544
You all told me to just forget
about my sister.

967
01:14:58,627 --> 01:14:59,836
To let her go.

968
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,922
That forgetting is
the only way forward.

969
01:15:04,758 --> 01:15:06,760
That's the only way
to be happy.

970
01:15:06,843 --> 01:15:10,222
You all kept spouting nonsense,
telling me to give up on her.

971
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,849
You knew nothing.
It was annoying.

972
01:15:15,393 --> 01:15:17,521
Sis, help me!

973
01:15:17,604 --> 01:15:19,481
Ja-young, what's wrong?

974
01:15:32,744 --> 01:15:35,914
Because of me, she died
and everyone became unhappy.

975
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:37,832
So, I had to
find a way.

976
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:40,711
Ugh, I told you not to
drink so much.

977
01:15:40,794 --> 01:15:42,254
Why do you always do this?

978
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:43,755
We hadn't seen
each other in six months.

979
01:15:43,838 --> 01:15:45,215
Just drop it, will you?

980
01:15:45,298 --> 01:15:47,050
Ugh, look at this mess.

981
01:15:47,133 --> 01:15:48,176
Ja-young!

982
01:15:48,259 --> 01:15:49,803
Oh, my pretty girl!

983
01:15:49,886 --> 01:15:52,180
Here, this is for you.

984
01:15:52,972 --> 01:15:54,099
Where's your sister?

985
01:15:55,058 --> 01:15:56,977
In-young, we brought gifts!

986
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,895
Ja-young, where is she?

987
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:01,523
In the bathroom.

988
01:16:01,606 --> 01:16:04,610
Then you give this
to In-young, okay?

989
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:05,694
Here.

990
01:16:05,777 --> 01:16:06,986
In-young.

991
01:16:17,831 --> 01:16:18,875
How many times did I tell you

992
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:20,208
we should've come home earlier?

993
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,877
And yet, was that
so hard for you?

994
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,587
- Huh?
- I get it, just stop.

995
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:24,880
This is why everything
ended up like this.

996
01:16:24,963 --> 01:16:26,798
What the hell do you
want me to do?

997
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:27,633
What do you
expect me to do now?

998
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:28,592
That's for you to figure out!

999
01:16:28,675 --> 01:16:31,053
A way my family
could be happy again.

1000
01:16:31,136 --> 01:16:32,054
You figure it out!

1001
01:16:32,137 --> 01:16:33,764
Fine! Then let's just go
our separate ways!

1002
01:16:33,847 --> 01:16:34,723
Ja-young.

1003
01:16:35,682 --> 01:16:37,017
From today...

1004
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,227
She's your new mom.

1005
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:40,937
And this is...

1006
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,856
your little sister, Seo-woo.

1007
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:46,485
Hi, Sis.

1008
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:48,153
Why am I your sister?

1009
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:52,031
A way I could protect
my dead sister.

1010
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:54,743
You know what?

1011
01:16:56,786 --> 01:16:59,122
I need my sister to be happy.

1012
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,084
'O spirits of
the five directions,

1013
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:03,669
The ghost seeks a life,

1014
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,128
Grant it a vessel.'

1015
01:17:05,211 --> 01:17:07,714
When five prophecies
are fulfilled

1016
01:17:07,797 --> 01:17:09,883
and five lives are taken...

1017
01:17:10,717 --> 01:17:13,303
the dead will
come back to life.

1018
01:17:15,054 --> 01:17:16,806
The spell of Gamigin.

1019
01:17:17,724 --> 01:17:20,143
It requires a keepsake
of the deceased.

1020
01:17:21,644 --> 01:17:23,105
Once the prophecy
is fulfilled,

1021
01:17:23,188 --> 01:17:25,607
you must give
the command to leave.

1022
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:28,989
(The dead will revive)

1023
01:17:32,071 --> 01:17:34,741
So, I decided to
bring her back to life.

1024
01:17:38,703 --> 01:17:41,623
Then, my family
will be reunited.

1025
01:17:42,665 --> 01:17:45,585
And I'll be able to
keep my promise.

1026
01:17:48,087 --> 01:17:49,589
It's your turn.

1027
01:17:50,089 --> 01:17:51,466
Dong-joon.

1028
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:12,320
Hands off!

1029
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:34,843
Die!

1030
01:18:55,655 --> 01:18:56,990
Sis...

1031
01:19:02,829 --> 01:19:04,163
Seo-woo.

1032
01:19:09,502 --> 01:19:11,212
It's just a dream.

1033
01:19:11,796 --> 01:19:13,631
What do you mean?

1034
01:19:14,424 --> 01:19:15,508
Just lie down.

1035
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:21,723
I said, stay down!

1036
01:19:21,806 --> 01:19:24,100
If you're really my sister,
you have to listen to me.

1037
01:19:24,183 --> 01:19:25,810
Why are you acting like this?

1038
01:19:27,103 --> 01:19:28,355
Stay down!

1039
01:19:28,438 --> 01:19:30,899
You're scaring me, Sis!

1040
01:19:35,194 --> 01:19:37,030
Sis...

1041
01:19:37,113 --> 01:19:39,073
I can't move.

1042
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:40,909
Sis...

1043
01:19:42,243 --> 01:19:44,203
Why are you doing this to me?

1044
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,876
Sis...

1045
01:19:50,376 --> 01:19:51,836
Sis...

1046
01:19:54,172 --> 01:19:55,882
Why would I be your sister?

1047
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:01,179
Sis...

1048
01:20:03,222 --> 01:20:05,600
Please untie me.

1049
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,521
Sis...

1050
01:20:13,691 --> 01:20:15,693
Why are you doing this?

1051
01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:48,849
(Does my sister truly love me?)

1052
01:20:51,688 --> 01:20:53,022
Sis...

1053
01:20:55,692 --> 01:20:57,735
Do you truly love me?

1054
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:01,114
Yes.

1055
01:21:02,615 --> 01:21:05,201
Then stay still
and let me be happy.

1056
01:21:05,952 --> 01:21:07,329
Why are you doing this?

1057
01:21:07,412 --> 01:21:09,414
Stop messing around!

1058
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:11,499
Don't be scared.

1059
01:21:11,582 --> 01:21:13,918
You're just letting my sister
borrow your body.

1060
01:21:17,088 --> 01:21:18,339
See you soon.

1061
01:21:33,438 --> 01:21:34,898
Sis...

1062
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:36,607
Sis!

1063
01:21:55,495 --> 01:21:57,837
(Right, Ga)

1064
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,047
The door...

1065
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:00,507
has opened.

1066
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:02,175
It has opened.

1067
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:03,342
It has opened.

1068
01:22:03,926 --> 01:22:05,553
It has opened.

1069
01:22:05,636 --> 01:22:07,138
It has opened.

1070
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:09,140
Please come in.

1071
01:22:09,223 --> 01:22:10,349
Please come in.

1072
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,143
Please come in.

1073
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,103
Please come in.

1074
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:39,799
(Right, Ga)

1075
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:43,675
We offer five souls.

1076
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:45,802
Take an eternal body.

1077
01:22:45,885 --> 01:22:48,387
The great being
shall grant us...

1078
01:23:27,218 --> 01:23:28,427
Please...

1079
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:30,721
In-young...

1080
01:24:14,056 --> 01:24:15,600
In-young?

1081
01:24:39,373 --> 01:24:41,125
Who are you?

1082
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:43,502
In-young...

1083
01:24:44,754 --> 01:24:46,172
Are you back to your senses?

1084
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:51,385
It's me, Ja-young.

1085
01:24:53,095 --> 01:24:55,014
I came too late, didn't I?

1086
01:24:56,641 --> 01:24:57,934
I'm sorry.

1087
01:25:00,186 --> 01:25:01,938
It's all my fault.

1088
01:25:05,107 --> 01:25:06,692
Ja-young?

1089
01:25:08,653 --> 01:25:10,905
Ja-young, you said?

1090
01:25:10,988 --> 01:25:11,948
In-young...

1091
01:25:15,034 --> 01:25:17,078
How much time...

1092
01:25:18,037 --> 01:25:20,414
has passed?

1093
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:24,126
I missed you.

1094
01:25:28,422 --> 01:25:29,924
No...

1095
01:25:30,007 --> 01:25:32,010
I remember falling
in the bathroom.

1096
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,220
You woke up in the hospital.

1097
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:35,888
Hospital?

1098
01:25:38,057 --> 01:25:39,225
Then...

1099
01:25:40,059 --> 01:25:41,936
Where are we now?

1100
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:44,105
I'll explain everything.

1101
01:25:44,188 --> 01:25:45,690
First, let's get out of here.

1102
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:48,109
- I'm scared.
- Let's go home.

1103
01:25:48,192 --> 01:25:49,777
I'll protect you forever.

1104
01:26:08,879 --> 01:26:10,172
In-young...

1105
01:26:30,609 --> 01:26:31,444
No...

1106
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:37,241
- Ja-young.
- Ja-young.

1107
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:45,124
- Why did you kill us?
- Why did you kill us?

1108
01:26:47,293 --> 01:26:48,252
- Why?
- Why?

1109
01:26:48,919 --> 01:26:50,505
- Why?
- Why?

1110
01:26:50,588 --> 01:26:51,256
- Why?
- Why?

1111
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:53,341
- Why, why, why!
- Why, why, why!

1112
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,519
What's wrong
with this thing?

1113
01:27:04,602 --> 01:27:05,436
Damn it.

1114
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:09,065
You saw your sister,
didn't you?

1115
01:27:10,232 --> 01:27:11,609
You're next.

1116
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:38,677
Thanks for pulling me
out of hell.

1117
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:41,472
In-young...

1118
01:27:42,556 --> 01:27:44,225
It was all my fault.

1119
