despite what he said?

14

I don't want to give up so soon.

15
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,480
If I had said something,

16
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,160
perhaps

17
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200

Zhou Youning called me

saying that she had a cold suddenly and couldn't come.

24

staged photos

30
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,280

Look.

32

You look so serious in this one.

39

How is it different from a photographer's?

40
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,280
It's not that bad.

Very angry.

154
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,810
But I understand.

155
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,040
You can blame me.

156
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,410
Don't blame Duzhi.

157
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,370
I told him to do that.

158
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,370
Why are you still worried about him?

159
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,370
Worry about yourself first.

160
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,370
What did the doctor say?

161
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,770
The doctor said...

162
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,370
there's not much time left.

163
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,270
But don't worry.

164
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,990
I found a new treatment method in Japan.

165
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,990
Maybe there's still a chance.

166
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,990
Really?

167
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,990
Then you can't lie to me anymore.

168
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,510
Don't worry.

169
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
I'll be fine.

170
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,370
I'll do my treatment.

171
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,950
This is the amulet you gave me when you were young.

172
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,270
I've been wearing it.

173
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,290
Now it's time to protect you.

174

176
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,600
Wang Zhan. I really want to beat you up.

177
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,230
So you wake up.

178
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,600
Why do you misunderstand Duzhi again?

179
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,100
Do you remember the first time you fainted?

180
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,600
The way he acted

181
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,250
was not something I've seen him done before.

182
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,620
Duzhi has known you for a long time.

183
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,470
He has been listening to your songs.

184
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,330
He has even watched

185
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,650
your performances before.

186
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,580
To me,

187
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,980
he's a very special person.

188
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,430
When I listen to his music,

189
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,860
I'll calm down.

190
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,830
He accompanied me through the worst times

191
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,420
of my life.

192
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,450
I don't know why

193
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,450
he doesn't want to show his feelings for you.

194
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,550
But he really cares about you.

195
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,050
He is the one

196
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,590
who truly cares about you.

197
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,310
You

198
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,540
need to learn to listen to others' feelings.

199
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,880
What's important

200
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,580
can't be heard with your ears.

201
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,690
You need to put your heart into it.

202
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,290
Okay.

203
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,420
Yingxiu.

204
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,290
I got it.

205
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,550
Tang Duzhi.

206
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,380
Are you treating me like a fool?

207
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,410
Wang Zhan?

208
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,040
How many more things are you hiding from me?

209
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,600
You kept my brother's situation from me.

210
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,440
You kept the fact that we've met before

211
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,600
from me.

212
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,750
Are you keeping the fact that you like me from me too?

213
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,040
I only found out that

214
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,920
you've watched my performances,

215
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,980
listened to my music

216
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,880
and helped me secretly

217
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,820
because Ji Huiyu told me about it.

218
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,260
Why didn't you tell me?

219
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,050
Do you think it's fun to treat me like a fool?

220
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,560
How many more things do I not know?

221
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,290
Why are you so nice to me when you

222
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,570
keep talking about keeping things professional?

223
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,770
Please.

224
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,810
Can you just be honest for once?

225
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,040
I think it's okay for me to

226
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,670
cheer him up like this.

227
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,040
Your encouragement,

228
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,540
I got it.

229
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,330
Tang Duzhi!

230
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,720
Don't keep your sadness to yourself!

231
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,660
Toss away your sadness!

232
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,080
Thank you.

233
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,109
I first met you

234
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,940
at your performance.

235
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,150
Then I met you at the bus station.

236
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
You were listening to music.

237
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,250
When something happened to my family,

238
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,250
when I wanted to give up on myself the most,

239
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,750
I heard your voice by the lake in the park.

240
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,930
I entered Hongze unconsciously

241
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,820
and became a funeral director,

242
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,890
becoming the person you see now.

243
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,720
I've always wanted to tell you

244
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,610
I want to be close to you.

245
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,820
I want to get close to you.

246
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,010
But my past...

247
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,570
My damn past...

248
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,310
keep telling me,

249
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,810
"You are a person who brings misfortune.

250
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,240
You have no right to live such a happy life."

251
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,740
Don't think like that.

252
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,120
Your parents and Jing'an

253
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,850
all want you to live happily.

254
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,110
Give me some time.

255
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,590
I'll give you an answer

256
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,710
about our relationship.

257
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,070
Are you asleep?

258
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,260
You're right next door,

259
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,740
but I still want to text you.

260
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,020
Why are you typing out so much nonsense?

261
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,580
Delete it.

262
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,300
Thank you for sharing everything with me.

263
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,540
Don't feel pressured.

264
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,630
I'll wait for your answer.

265
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,060
Something feels missing.

266
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,030
I miss you.

267
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,450
This seems too direct.

268
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,560
No.

269
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,160
Get some rest.

270
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,070
Let me help you.

271
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,200
Here.

272
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,520
Your arm.

273
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,080
Let me teach you.

274
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,820
Like this.

275
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,400
Yes, be careful here.

276
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,650
Yes.

277
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:08,850
Okay.

278
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,670
The other side.

279
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,630
Wang Zhan.

280
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,870
Where did you go yesterday?

281
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,330
Did something happen?

282
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,430
I...

283
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,930
We've talked it out.

284
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,180
From now on,

285
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,340
I won't hide anything from him anymore.

286
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,690
Who would believe you?

287
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,220
Let's talk outside.

288
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,520
Today,

289
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,060
Wang Zhan has to follow me.

290
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,220
Where are we going today?

291
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,780
There's a change in today's training schedule.

292
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,150
I need your help.

293
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,030
Help?

294
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,240
Because you're not the one being trained today,

295
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,030
but me.

296
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,010
One, two.

297
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,380
Mr. Tu, hold on.

298
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,640
Here, it's

299
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,760
one, two, three, four.

300
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,770
Okay?

301
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,730
One more time.

302
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,780
Youning, are you okay?

303
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,730
I'm fine.

304
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,210
Tu Jinghe,

305
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,710
we are completely out of sync.

306
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,390
You need emotions when dancing.

307
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,640
Only like this can the guests

308
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,580
feel the happiness between us

309
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,360
during the wedding.

310
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,040
Understand?

311
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,530
Yes.

312
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,780
Let me demonstrate with Vivi.

313
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,530
I've been learning dance from her for a long time.

314
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,170
Let me show you what being in sync is like.

315
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,760
Let me practice with you.

316
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,890
That's right, Mr. Tu.

317
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,200
That's the expression.

318
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,360
We need to talk.

319
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,290
Let me ask you.

320
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,870
Do you not want to get married anymore?

321
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,860
Yes.

322
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,510
I have someone I want to marry more.

323
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,540
Zhang Yiqing, right?

324
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,380
I think he's quite interested in you.

325
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,300
There was a misunderstanding between us,

326
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,000
but now it's resolved.

327
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,070
So... I'm half a matchmaker?

328
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,700
I'm sorry.

329
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,050
You don't have to apologize.

330
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,130
We don't owe each other anything.

331
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,880
No, I broke off the engagement.

332
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,040
I should be responsible.

333
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,950
If you want to take responsibility, then take it till the end.

334
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,020
Even if it's just an act,

335
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,850
finish it up.

336
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,710
What are you talking about?

337
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,590
I just want to tell you

338
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,730
I can't continue acting.

339
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,880
If you break off the engagement now,

340
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,870
I'll tell my dad.

341
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,650
My dad listens to me.

342
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,740
If I complain to him

343
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,640
your company will be over.

344
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,820
Zhou Youning, are you crazy?

345
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,700
I already told you

346
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,900
my relationship with Qing.

347
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,090
Why do I have to go all the way in this act?

348
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,740
You can keep acting, right?

349
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,710
Why are we here again?

350
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,550
Since that accident,

351
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,860
I haven't eaten here again.

352
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,750
I even avoided the area

353
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,320
near this restaurant.

354
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,020
Don't force yourself.

355
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,750
I'm being trained today.

356
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,270
I hope you can help me

357
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,640
celebrate my birthday this year.
