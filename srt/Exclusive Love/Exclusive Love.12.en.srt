00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,500
[Episode 12: Just so you become exclusively mine]

3
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:34,400
Tang Duzhi!

4
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,380
Let's go.

5
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,220
Wang Zhan!

6
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,010
I forgot to ask you to make a wish when eating the cake just now.

7
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,950
Make a wish to me.

8
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,800
Make a wish that

9
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,240
I'll always be by your side.

10
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,420
Tang Duzhi.

11
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,760
I'll wait for you to come back.

12
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,050
This is your birthday gift.

13
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,280
It shielded me from the stab.

14
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,120
Tang Duzhi.

15
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,120
Just trust me.

16
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,640
As long as we are together,

17
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,760
it will all be fine.

18
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,950
The police have caught them.

19
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,070
It was Mr. Zhuang who planned all this.

20
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,510
He said he just wanted to teach Wang Zhan a lesson.

21
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,550
With Yingxiu not around,

22
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,750
he's becoming worse.

23
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,410
We won't let him go.

24
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,170
Thank you for saving me with Tang Duzhi.

25
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,070
Don't say that.

26
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,660
That'd make me feel worse.

27
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,480
Go back first.

28
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,290
I'll take care of the rest.

29
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,550
Also,

30
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,800
I won't be going back to the villa.

31
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
I'll ask someone to get the luggage.

32
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,820
Tang Duzhi!

33
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,150
Take care of Ponyo for me.

34
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,880
Its name is Hua.

35
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,000
I already told you I'm a pet communicator.

36
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,880
It doesn't like that name at all.

37
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,310
Also,

38
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,200
you have to take good care of Wang Zhan.

39
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,060
Do you hear me?

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,500
Of course.

41
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,490
If Tang Duzhi treats you badly,

42
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,830
let me know.

43
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,580
I'll come back and beat him up.

44
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,570
When did you

45
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,100
become good friends?

46
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,670
We're leaving.

47
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,690
Bye bye.

48
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,480
We're leaving.

49
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
Du!

50
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,270
You must be happy!

51
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,780
What are you looking at?

52
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,770
So you're Ji Huiyu.

53
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,390
You were the one who investigated me.

54
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,650
It was also you who sowed discord between Wang Zhan and I.

55
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,220
Because you were trying to tear them apart.

56
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,130
You'd better keep your word.

57
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,380
Don't get involved in their relationship anymore.

58
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,410
As long as Wang Zhan is happy,

59
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,060
I won't do anything.

60
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,740
Me too.

61
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,630
As long as Du is happy,

62
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,640
I won't do anything.

63
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,470
I'm hungry.

64
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,020
After settling the things,

65
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,200
let's go eat.

66
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,240
How's braised pork rice?

67
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,850
Do you eat it mixed up or not?

68
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,270
Mixed up, of course.

69
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,580
That's right. Otherwise it's not delicious.

70
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,460
Let's go.

71
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,210
Let's go.

72
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,020
Give me the bracelet.

73
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,570
It's broken.

74
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,350
All fixed.

75
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,470
You're finally willing to wear it.

76
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,850
Once I wear it,

77
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,860
I won't take it off easily.

78
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,320
Is this your answer?

79
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,490
This...

80
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,170
is my answer.

81
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
Morning, Mr. Wang.

82
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,130
Having attended so many funerals,

83
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,990
it's my first time attending my own.

84
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,380
Brother.

85
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,310
Everything is ready.

86
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,340
Do you know why I want to do it?

87
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,050
In a normal funeral,

88
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,330
those who have passed can't hear anything.

89
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,460
Only by doing a living funeral

90
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,600
can everyone have the chance to tell their true feelings.

91
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,020
That's right.

92
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,470
Yingxiu, please.

93
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,010
Let's go.

94
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,510
Thank you for coming to my living funeral.

95
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,690
Being in this industry,

96
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,210
I've seen too much.

97
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,230
You never know what will happen next.

98
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,440
So,

99
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,020
I still want to hold a funeral.

100
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,360
What worries me the most now

101
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,750
is my brother.

102
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,400
Wang Zhan.

103
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,140
I'm leaving the company to you.

104
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,490
I believe you can do it.

105
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,200
Don't forget you're a funeral director.

106
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,200
Yingxiu is currently your client.

107
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,410
Brother.

108
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,430
I'll wait for you to return.

109
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,270
It's okay.

110
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,950
I have your amulet.

111
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:58,900
[Three years later]

112
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,280
[I'll be the successor. I'll become a pig if I break my promise.
Wang Zhan!]

113
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,330
Are you ready?

114
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,030
Let's go.

115
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,160
Give me a minute.

116
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,460
Let me finish reading this proposal.

117
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,260
Stop reading.

118
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,080
Are you ready?

119
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,020
Let me finish reading the proposal first.

120
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,510
Tang Duzhi, what are you doing?

121
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,310
Let's go!

122
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,470
Tang Duzhi!

123
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,460
Will it kill you to let me finish reading it?

124
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,740
Put me down!

125
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,280
Are you going to put me down or not?

126
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,530
Be good.

127
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,790
Or I will put you in the boot again.

128
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,390
That again?

129
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,510
Do I look good?

130
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,770
Are you satisfied,

131
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,360
my groom?

132
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,130
Yes.

133
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,410
Very much so.

134
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,250
Really?

135
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,910
Yes.

136
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,870
Do you not see us?

137
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,140
My Qing

138
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,630
is the most handsome groom, okay?

139
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Why do you have to get married

140
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,070
on the same day as us?

141
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,370
You insisted on choosing the same venue with us.

142
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,730
Yes, you're not original at all.

143
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,380
You're the copycat.

144
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,560
He's been copying us since we were in high school.

145
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,850
We had this time slot booked long ago.

146
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,980
We've been vying this place for a long time.

147
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,020
You've been copying me since high school.

148
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,120
For how long more are you going to keep this up?

149
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,920
Stop arguing.

150
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,690
You look like a chive

151
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,750
and a sweet potato.

152
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,400
The wedding is about to begin.

153
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,200
Don't let this affect your mood.

154
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,930
Look at this cold-blooded instructor go again.

155
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,420
-You two look like a pair of blue and white slippers.
-You two look like a pair of blue and white slippers.

156
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,300
-Shut up.
-Shut up.

157
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,030
-I don't like to repeat myself.
-He doesn't like to repeat himself.

158
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,540
The perfect relationship in life

159
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,980
is to find a lifelong partner

160
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980
who'll hold an umbrella when you're caught in the rain

161
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,510
and understand you even when no words are exchanged.

162
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,880
From the moment you exchange your wedding rings,

163
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,780
you will start a new journey

164
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,530

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,800
Everyone, are you ready?

189
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,730
Yes!

190
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,120
Three, two, one.

191
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,800
Go!

192
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:15,950
The wedding is so busy.

193
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,950
I'm still hungry.

194
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,890
I've been learning cooking from you for three years.

195
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,060
But Wang Zhan still says my cooking is like trash.

196
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,580
Instant noodles should be fine, right?

197
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,340
Is it good?

198
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,910
Your cooking is as always.

199
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,630
I knew Wang Zhan was talking nonsense.

200
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,380
You're the best.

201
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,690
You never lie to me.

202
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,220
There's something I lied to you about.

203
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,020
I want to confess to you about it.

204
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,080
What is it?

205
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,960
Are you regretting it now?

206
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,570
Actually, when we spent the night here

207
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,570
last time...

208
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,410
Gosh, I was nervous for nothing.

209
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,320
I fell asleep last time.

210
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,250
I forgot.

211
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,990
I've got to do it again when I'm conscious this time.

212
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,310
Didn't I tell you I had to do this event proposal first?

213
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,640
They're rushing us now.

214
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,120
Road running with the urn.

215
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,120
Immersive death experience.

216
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,220
After you took over,

217
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,040
you've been coming up with all these tricks.

218
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,300
Next, I'll be playing

219
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,960
peaceful music to calm the family down.

220
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,350
I'll operate it myself.

221
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,730
Okay.

222
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,700
Ignore that for now.

223
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:30,980
Today,

224
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,550
you are mine.

225
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,670
Very well.

226
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,370
Do you want to have dinner first

227
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,770
or go for the dessert directly?

228
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,340
It's your turn now.

229
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,990
It'll be difficult to surpass us.

230
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,530
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

231
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,680
I won't lose to them.

232
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,240
♫As if I'm trapped in a noisy world♫

233
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,320
♫Should I wish for a better tomorrow?♫

234
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:25,070
♫I can't say I love you♫

235
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,070
♫The grey sky♫

236
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,610
♫It's as if it's laughing at me♫

237
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,320
♫Expectations always bring more disappointment♫

238
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,100
♫But in love, who doesn't get hurt?♫

239
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:52,450
♫The sky is so vast♫

240
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,570
♫There will be someone who will always be the light of each other♫

241
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,570
♫Holding your hand♫

242
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,660
♫Love has to go to the end♫

243
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:12,690
♫Let's take each other as the exit of life♫

244
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:21,090
♫Announce to the world I just want to stay for you♫

245
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,420
♫I want this forever♫

246
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,680
♫Okay?♫

247
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,890
[The End]
