[Episode 2: Annoying and Terrifying Special Training]

3
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,479
The dietary method to overcome blood phobia

4
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,870
is to supplement iron and vitamins.

5
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,770
I have no appetite.

6
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,979
Eat it yourself.

7
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,630
Besides, my hand is injured.

8
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,729
It's inconvenient for me to eat.

9
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,640
Eat with your left hand.

10
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:50,070
My left hand is not my dominant hand.

11
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,130
I don't know how to eat with it.

12
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,000
If you don't eat it yourself,

13
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,990
I can feed you.

14
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,290
I have many ways to make you eat it.

15
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,090
Or do you want to repeat...

16
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,750
What happened last night?

17
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,250
If you spit it out,

18
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,340
the penalty will be tripled.

19
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,030
Continue.

20
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,600
Hello?

21
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,590
You're also still working overtime at this hour?

22
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,820
Are you saying you haven't received the project payment?

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,340
Okay.

24
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,250
I'll ask the accountant to confirm it tomorrow.

25
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,640
Sorry about that.

26
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,450
Mom.

27
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,260
I'm working overtime.

28
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,070
Why are you still up so late?

29
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,329
Another blind date?

30
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,450
Okay.

31
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,390
Alright.

32
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,110
I have to get back to work.

33
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,920
Luckily, I've still got you.

34
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,630
Hungry, huh?

35
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,160
Trying to blow me off with this?

36
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,820
Is this all we can be?

37
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,050
Stop it.

38
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,320
Don't think about sleeping in.

39
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,320
Get up and exercise.

40
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,820
Can't you let me sleep a bit longer?

41
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,530
It's only 5 a.m.

42
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,070
Why did you bring me here so early?

43
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,060
As the successor of the company, you must be on call 24/7.

44
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,659
So you need to improve your physical strength.

45
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,659
So?

46
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,070
You need to jog every morning as exercise.

47
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,700
Training?

48
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,600
Also,

49
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,620
you must memorize all the proper terms

50
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,659
of the funeral industry.

51
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,720
You want me to memorize them while I jog?

52
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,480
Do you understand?

53
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,060
Yes.

54
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,890
Do you understand?

55
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,190
Yes.

56
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,990
Do you understand?

57
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,990
Yes!

58
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,500
Start.

59
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,450
Faster.

60
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,820
-Why should I jog?
-Again.

61
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,130
Repeat after me loudly.

62
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,570
All the arrangements during a funeral...

63
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,710
All the arrangements during a funeral...

64
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,070
Including setting up the memorial tablet, encoffining...

65
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,570
Including setting up the memorial tablet, encoffining...

66
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,120
Burial, date picking...

67
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,800
Burial, date picking...

68
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,480
Obituary printing, content design and writing...

69
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,280
Obituary printing, content design and writing...

70
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,980
Mourning hall decoration,

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
farewell hall reservation and decoration...

72
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,020
Mourning hall decoration and farewell ceremony decoration...

73
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,860
I've sent you the location of my blind date.

74
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,360
I'm going in.

75
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,350
That's weird.

76
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,430
Is he really not coming?

77
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,140
Don't go in there.

78
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,300
Come with me.

79
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,580
It's finally over.

80
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,190
Your reward is too exaggerated, don't you think?

81
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,510
Pick up all the confetti.

82
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,020
Are you kidding me?

83
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,270
Do I look like I'm kidding?

84
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,770
You ran back too slowly.

85
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,770
This is a punishment,

86
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,270
and it can help train your concentration.

87
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,140
This is just a prank.

88
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,270
Take it as concentration training.

89
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,020
Is there any problem?

90
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,370
No.

91
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,610
Start.

92
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,470
This is a prank.

93
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,670
Is there anyone inside?

94
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,930
Whatever.

95
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,610
What are you doing in my room?

96
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,580
My bathroom needs fixing,

97
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,110
so I thought I'd use yours.

98
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,030
I'll ask someone to fix it.

99
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,210
Which way are you going exactly?

100
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,240
Hey!

101
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,960
Sorry! I didn't see anything.

102
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,960
I mean, I didn't see anything.

103
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,960
I'm not saying you've got nothing there.

104
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,560
What the hell am I talking about...

105
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,450
Give me back my towel.

106
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,960
How should I?

107
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,560
Let go,

108
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,960
and give me the towel.

109
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,880
I'll go take a shower.

110
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,030
Transfer student!

111
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,380
Do you live nearby?

112
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,380
I heard from our teacher that you live alone.

113
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,440
Isn't it boring living alone?

114
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,380
My family won't be coming home tonight.

115
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,870
I'm really hungry.

116
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,380
Can I...

117
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,650
Can I go to your place for dinner?

118
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,620
Sir, your food is ready.

119
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,670
I'm starving.

120
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,120
You dragged me here

121
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,190
before I could eat anything.

122
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,350
Promise me one thing first.

123
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,250
Let me have a bite first.

124
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,010
Don't go on blind dates with people you don't like again.

125
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,410
So, if I can never meet someone I like,

126
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,630
will you stay with me?

127
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,390
I think so.

128
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,150
Will you stay with me...

129
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,990
Forever?

130
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,760
Well, we're meant to be friends forever.

131
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,110
Don't worry, Yingxiu.

132
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,460
Everything is under control.

133
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,650
Take a look at this.

134
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,480
Don't let Wang Zhan

135
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,320
about this.

136
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,070
The best late night snack is instant noodles with beer.

137
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,340
Why do I seem to see Tang Duzhi?

138
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,540
It's really you.

139
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,740
Are you sleepwalking?

140
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,740
Who

141
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,780
allowed you to eat these?

142
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,780
Go away!

143
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,140
Clean it up and go back to your room.

144
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,820
You know what?

145
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,260
I know I have my responsibilities.

146
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,800
Although I'm a rich successor,

147
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,070
my soul is empty.

148
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,840
I have two friends who also

149
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,580
took over their family businesses like this.

150
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,640
But I really love singing.

151
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,240
Singing can bring warmth to people.

152
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,410
So,

153
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,750
even if there's only one person,

154
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,390
I will sing for him.

155
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,010
Don't you know how late it is?

156
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,030
What the hell's your problem?

157
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,990
Just let me finish this song.

158
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,990
I'll take over right after that.

159
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,490
Okay?

160
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,490
♫Find the answer that belongs to you♫

161
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,920
What are you doing?

162
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,120
Put me down!

163
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,340
Tang Duzhi!

164
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,380
Let me finish this song!

165
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,140
Put me down.

166
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,160
Tang Duzhi.

167
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,240
Let go of me...

168
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,290
Tang Duzhi!

169
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,660
It's concert time.

170
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,100
Let go.

171
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,930
I can't be the only one at the concert.

172
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,040
I'll be scared

173
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,540
if I'm the only one.

174
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,040
Let go.

175
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,040
Do you know why I'm scared?

176
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,570
Let me tell you a secret.

177
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,700
You can't tell others about it.

178
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,220
Because my brother

179
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,390
would take me to scary places when I was little.

180
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,840
That's why I'm scared.

181
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,100
He only took you to the hospitals and farewell ceremonies

182
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,430
to train you

183
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,930
so that you could get used to it.

184
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,730
All that training was to prepare you

185
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,070
for the succession.

186
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,930
Why do you know me so well?

187
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,250
Have you been watching me in secret?

188
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,410
No way.

189
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,599
That's not possible.

190
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,170
The reason why you know me so well

191
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,710
is that this is your job.

192
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,170
Let me ask you.

193
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,339
Don't you feel scared when you touch

194
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,960
those dead bodies?

195
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,820
Who wouldn't be scared

196
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,070
seeing a dead body,

197
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,600
especially one that is decayed and damaged?

198
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,570
Some funeral directors who are new to the profession

199
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,070
will have nightmares,

200
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,610
and some will have nausea.

201
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,850
So what should I do to not feel scared?

202
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,720
When funeral directors feel scared,

203
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
they need to stay calm themselves

204
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,160
so that the deceased

205
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,750
can go to another world in peace.

206
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,280
As a funeral director, when you feel scared,

207
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,780
take a deep breath

208
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,770
and show respect for the deceased.

209
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,290
What you said...

210
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,330
Is it like this?

211
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,780
Thank you all.

212
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,730
I love you.

213
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,740
It's you again.

214
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,330
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

215
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,440
I was dreaming.

216
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,280
I was catching a ghost.

217
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,070
Enough.

218
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,570
Stop it.

219
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,940
I'm leaving.

220
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,240
Yesterday...

221
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,290
Yesterday?

222
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,770
Yesterday, you said you'd study hard.

223
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,410
Don't forget what you said.

224
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,460
How is that possible?

225
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,650
Don't try to lie to me just because I blacked out last night.

[I'll be the successor. I'll become a pig if I break my promise.

227
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,780
You have to

228
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,110
keep your promise.

229
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,390
Just let me finish this song.

230
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,210
I'll take over right after that.

231
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,800
Okay?

232
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,940
How do you prove it?

233
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,450
I'll sign.

[Wang Zhan]

235
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,630
I was drunk last night.

236
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,490
You're so scheming.

237
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,100
As long as it can solve the problem,

238
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,290
it's a good method.

239
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,340
No one will like you if you behave like this.

240
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,530
I don't need others to like me.

241
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,480
You made a mistake yesterday.

242
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,160
Your training today will be doubled.

243
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,920
Any problem?

244
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,940
Start.

[Postscript of the Successor]

Buddy, your earphone.

247
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,740
Thank you.

248
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,300
What song are you listening to?

249
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,930
It's a song I wrote myself.

250
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,730
Do you want to listen to it?

251
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,850
May I?
