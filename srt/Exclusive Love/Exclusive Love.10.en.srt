[Episode 10: I'm Your Funeral Director]

3
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,870
Why did you bring me back here?

4
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,640
Since that accident,

5
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,720
I haven't eaten at this place again.

6
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,530
I've even been deliberately avoiding

7
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,259
the vicinity of this restaurant.

8
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,900
Don't force yourself.

9
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,900
I'm the one who's being trained today.

10
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,310
Although my birthday this year has passed, I hope you can

11
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,650
help me celebrate it today.

12
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,060
Be careful. Here's your cake.

13
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,210
Thank you.

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,710
How can you miss the birthday cake for a birthday meal?

15
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,240
I just asked someone

16
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,710
to prepare this secretly.

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,210
Do you like it?

18
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,710
Seeing your family photo,

19
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,740
actually, I quite envy you.

20
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,060
Why can't you just open up your heart

21
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,560
and celebrate your birthday with me happily...

22
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,960
Today is my parents' death anniversary,

23
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,180
right on my birthday.

24
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,670
I'm sorry. I might have gone too far.

25
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,890
This is okay, right?

26
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,560
Stand a bit closer.

27
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,060
Happy smile.

28
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,660
Three, two, one.

29
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,640
One more.

30
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,290
Three, two, one.

31
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,070
Look.

32
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,460
You look much better this way.

33
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,970
The long face doesn't suit you.

34
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,710
Thanks,

35
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,210
for coming here with me.

36
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,210
Don't mention it.

37
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,210
Well then,

38
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,960
I also want to thank you.

39
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,300
For everything you've done for me.

40
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,960
I dared not get closer to you

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,550
because I care about you a lot.

42
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,280
And because I care,

43
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,280
I'm really afraid of losing you.

44
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,360
Make a wish to me.

45
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,280
Why do you seem to like wishes?

46
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,880
I forgot to ask you to make a wish when eating the cake just now.

47
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,110
Make a wish to me.

48
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,050
Just make the wish that

49
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,420
I'll always be by your side.

50
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,130
I already made one.

51
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,280
Really?

52
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,770
What did you wish for?

53
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,280
My wish has come true.

54
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,030
Is it...

55
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,320
Tang Duzhi.

56
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,920
Make a wish to me.

57
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,760
I'll go get some water.

58
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,560
Be right back.

59
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,640
Hope we can come here together on my birthday next year!

60
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,550
Is something wrong?

61
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,710
I wish you could go back to how you were before.

62
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,050
I don't like how you're just working every day now,

63
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,150
living an unhappy life.

64
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,870
Wang Zhan.

65
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,070
You are...

66
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,870
I'm Iron Man.

67
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,210
Dad.

68
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,050
Mom.

69
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,030
Now, Brother has someone by his side

70
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,690
and is doing really well.

71
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,440
You...

72
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,600
Oh, you.

73
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,870
How about we take a break

74
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,980
and have some dinner?

75
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,370
I'm not hungry.

76
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,510
I want to finish packing his stuff first.

77
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,050
I'll help you.

78
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,820
You go back first.

79
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,390
I want to keep you company.

80
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,060
Go back first.

81
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,250
Okay.

82
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,909
Take care.

83
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
During this period,

84
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,860
I hope you can help me with one thing.

85
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,910
Go ahead.

86
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,410
I hope you can send Jing'an off.

87
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,080
Good afternoon, family and friends.

88
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,730
Today, we gather here

89
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,460
to bid farewell to a young man who loved music,

90
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,660
Tang Jing'an.

91
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,730
Although Jing'an only lived for 24 years,

92
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,530
he composed a beautiful piece of music

93
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,880
with his short life.

94
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,910
The bracelet I made?

95
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,830
How come?

96
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,470
Jing'an would definitely love

97
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,440
the gift you gave him.

Tang Duzhi.

107
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,760
I've decided.

108
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,480
I will take over.

109
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,330
I like music

110
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,050
because music can bring warmth to people.

111
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,240
This job does that as well.

112
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,720
I hope I can bring some warmth

113
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,260
to the families who have lost their loved ones,

114
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,830
just like you do.

115
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,730
You're already qualified to take over.

116
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,860
I should thank you.

117
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,040
You taught me all these.

118
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,070
The successor training is over.

119
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,260
Next,

120
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,220
I'll be away for a while.

121
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,590
Be away?

122
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,000
Where are you going?

123
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,610
Jing'an has passed away.

124
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,250
It was all my fault.

125
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,740
It was an accident.

126
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,540
Please, don't think like that, okay?

127
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,680
I don't want to, either.

128
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,700
I also hate this side of myself.

129
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,160
I'll keep you company.

130
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,190
No matter what happens,

131
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,530
and no matter how long it takes.

132
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,260
I'm sorry.

133
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,700
I don't want to harm you.

134
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,200
And I can't be so selfish.

135
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,230
I can't accept myself like this

136
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,200
and go on with you.

137
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,270
Tang Duzhi.

138
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,950
Tang Duzhi!

139
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,480
Tang Duzhi, are you home?

140
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,620
You haven't been answering my calls

141
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,920
or replying to my messages.

142
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,320
I don't even know where you are,

143
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,960
so I had to come to your place.

144
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,790
Tang Duzhi.

145
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,120
Can you hear me?

146
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,380
I have an important thing

147
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,490
that only you can help me with.

148
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,830
Didn't you promise me

149
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,550
that you would help me

150
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,630
no matter what happens?

151
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,100
No matter what happens in the future,

152
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,660
I'll be there.

153
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,070
Tang Duzhi.

154
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,990
What do you want me to help you with?

155
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,920
If I didn't need your help,

156
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,160
you wouldn't see me?

157
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,140
Go back if there's nothing.

158
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
What are you doing?

159
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,470
Mr. Tang Duzhi.

160
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,800
As a funeral director, I'm going to purify your body now.

161
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,000
Please relax.

162
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,850
After a person passes away,

163
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,350
the tension of their muscles is very different from when they were alive.

164
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,350
So during purification,

165
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,100
we need to pay extra attention to the pressure.

166
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,740
All these details are meant

167
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,930
to ensure that family members can

168
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,210
say a proper goodbye to their loved ones.

169
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,590
They've entrusted us with

170
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,490
their dearest family,

171
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,050
and it is our responsibility

172
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,800
to ensure they have a proper final farewell.

173
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,360
I'm your funeral director.

174
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,380
I remember everything you said.

175
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,300
But seeing you like this,

176
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,240
I cannot help but think I failed my responsibility

177
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,350
by not letting you bid farewell to Jing'an properly.

178
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,370
Only you can help me with this.

179
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,450
Tang Duzhi.

180
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,990
I'll wait for you to come back.

181
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,530
As the successor, you need to take care of your appearance.

182
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,030
It's a sign of respect for the clients,

183
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,530
and also for yourself.

184
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,920
Are you ready?

185
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,780
Are you ready?

186
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,260
It's time to enter the company.

187
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,090
I'm ready.

188
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,580
You know what?

189
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,340
He's Yingxiu's younger brother.

190
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,340
He's here to take over today.

191
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,050
Regarding Yingxiu's matter,

192
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,400
I think everyone knows about it now.

193
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,740
But since he's in the hospital and can't be here today,

194
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,830
I think,

195
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,130
your first day at work won't be easy.

196
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,000
I know.

197
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,880
I'll take it as it comes.

198
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,660
Be confident.

199
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,100
You promised me that.

200
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,880
The elevator is here.

201
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,180
[Hope we can come here together on my birthday next year!]

202
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,100
All these details are meant

203
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,290
to ensure that family members can

204
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,520
say a proper goodbye to their loved ones.

205
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,680
Tang Duzhi.

206
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,290
I'll wait for you to come back.

207
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,690
Tang Duzhi is the most important partner

208
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,680
of Hongze Funeral Directors.

209
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,490
Mr. Zhuang.

210
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,150
If you can't

211
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,460
respect our company's colleague,

212
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,110
then I'm sorry to tell you that

213
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,780
we're not on the same page.

214
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,480
As for the investment,

215
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,550
I don't think we need to give it any more thought.

216
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,250
Compared to those things you're afraid of,

217
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,260
human nature is much scarier, isn't it?

218
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,040
Mr. Zhuang just wants to

219
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,480
take advantage of my brother's sickness

220
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,480
to steal Hongze's business.

221
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,460
That's right.

222
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,440
But is it necessary for you to offend him

223
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,240
for Tang Duzhi's sake?

224
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,070
You just joined the company.

225
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,190
What if he plays some tricks

226
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,800
behind your back?

227
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,180
He can say whatever he wants about me,

228
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,380
but I won't accept it

229
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,240
if he speaks ill of Tang Duzhi.

230
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,280
So you still care about Tang Duzhi.

231
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,710
He won't help you,

232
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,950
neither is he willing to.

233
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,160
Stop lying to yourself.

234
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,580
If he was willing,

235
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,400
he'd be here today

236
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,650
since it's your first day at the company.

237
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,550
I don't know what's gotten into me,

238
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,050
but I feel like he's right beside me,

239
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,410
encouraging me

240
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,180
and cheering for me.

241
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:24,960
Wang Zhan.

242
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,770
Can't you see

243
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,400
who truly cares for you,

244
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,830
who's always been by your side,

245
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,460
and who truly likes you?

246
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,110
What are you trying to say?

247
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,030
Actually,

248
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,500
the person who really likes you

249
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,770
is not Tang Duzhi,

250
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,860
but me.
