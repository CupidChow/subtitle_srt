[Exclusive Love]

2
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,910
It took me a long time to give up on you.

3
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,990
[Episode 7: Mix It or Not? Love is Complicated]

4
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,479
I can't afford to waver anymore.

5
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,880
Where are you going?

6
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,630
Why am I in bed with you?

7
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,890
I remember being outside yesterday.

8
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,570
Not bad.

9
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,310
You didn't black out from the hangover.

10
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,730
Where are my clothes?

11
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,180
Why did you take off my clothes?

12
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,680
Why don't you ask yourself?

13
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,040
Did you completely forget

14
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,910
what happened last night?

15
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,120
Last night?

16
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,589
Could it be that

17
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,070
something happened

18
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,660
between us last night?

19
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,409
What do you think?

20
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,250
Tu Jinghe.

21
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,290
Tu Jinghe!

22
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,600
I can't even handle my own problems,

23
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,050
and you keep bothering me.

24
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,670
I'm in a nuclear-level situation here.

25
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,270
What the hell did he mean by kissing me?

26
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,040
Isn't it obvious?

27
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,470
He likes you, too.

28
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,700
You two are in a situation where you like each other

29
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,470
but haven't admitted it yet.

30
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,530
But he clearly said before that

31
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,510
he had no feelings for me.

32
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,280
So he lied to you.

33
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,460
Before, his kindness towards you

34
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,400
could barely be explained as him taking care of you.

35
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
But now, he's already kissed you.

36
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,760
What else is there to say?

37
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,450
So now, I should...

38
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,090
Go ask him directly

39
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,360
what that kiss means.

40
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,050
Are you saying I should go head-to-head with him?

41
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,650
That's not appropriate, is it?

42
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,660
In my opinion,

43
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,050
you two are already like a couple.

44
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,600
You just haven't admitted it yet.

45
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
So we are kind of...

46
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,630
A future couple?

47
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,860
Yes.

48
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,200
You guys just need a moment

49
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,210
to get it off your chest.

50
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,520
You must seize the chance.

51
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,450
Otherwise, if you two end up like me and Jinghe,

52
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,220
it would be troublesome.

53
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,850
I can never do something like

54
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,980
kissing someone else's fiancé

55
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,220
and insisting on helping them organize their wedding.

56
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,530
I just want to give it one last try.

57
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,560
Maybe

58
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,500
he'll break off their engagement.

59
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,380
What if he didn't?

60
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,970
If not,

61
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,690
I'll give him my best wishes.

62
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,760
I didn't see you when I woke up today.

63
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,230
Where have you been?

64
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,970
I couldn't sleep last night,

65
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,159
because...

66
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,420
Your room was too hot,

67
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,030
so he came to me.

68
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,820
Yes.

69
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,770
Maybe I was too excited.

70
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,580
But haven't you always been sleeping well?

71
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,550
Well...

72
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,030
Well...

73
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,520
I need to take this call.

74
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,530
The room card and my ID are both in my wallet.

75
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,310
Go check out first.

76
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,480
Hello?

77
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,680
Yes.

78
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
This is the best chance for you to talk.

79
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,340
What?

80
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,260
[Birthday: November 8, 1999]

81
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,900
His birthday is next month.

82
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,200
So on his birthday,

83
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,770
you just...

84
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,390
Wang Zhan!

85
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,690
There's a change to our schedule today.

86
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,180
But

87
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,910
your outfit isn't quite suitable

88
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,930
for the occasion we're going to.

89
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,860
You didn't suddenly get some case

90
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,220
and need to take me to meet the family, did you?

91
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,880
Take it.

92
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,020
Go try these on.

93
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,770
Tell me, okay?

94
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,990
So I can be prepared.

95
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,809
We're having a meeting with an important partner of

96
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,090
Hongze Funeral Directors.

97
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,409
We have a lot of opportunities

98
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,590
to work with him in the future.

99
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,890
An important partner?

100
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,950
As the successor, you need to take care of your appearance.

101
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,820
It's a sign of respect for the clients,

102
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,080
and also for yourself.

103
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,150
I don't like wearing suits.

104
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,270
My first suit

105
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,820
was a disaster.

106
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,000
When I was a little boy, my brother forced me to wear a suit

107
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,320
to attend a relatives' wedding.

108
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,320
At that time, my suit felt tight,

109
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,940
and I accidentally spilled a drink

110
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,960
on the bride.

111
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,310
My first suit was given to me by my dad as a gift.

112
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,480
He said a suit represents a man's maturity

113
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,600
and also his responsibility.

114
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,590
He hopes I can take good care of myself,

115
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,100
and more importantly, understand the importance of giving to others.

116
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,440
I've always

117
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,130
remembered that.

118
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,790
This seems to be the first time.

119
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,050
The first time?

120
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,220
The first time you're telling me about your family.

121
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,050
You look good in a suit.

122
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,490
What are you doing?

123
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,960
Very few drivers are willing to

124
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,390
drive this far to pick up a passenger.

125
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,130
So?

126
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,370
Get in my car.

127
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,590
I'll tip a bit extra.

128
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,650
Someone will come.

129
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,460
If you listen to me,

130
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,040
there's a chance

131
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,070
I'll tell you

132
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,300
what happened last night.

133
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:31,940
Where are we going?

134
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,920
You'll see.

135
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,300
Isn't this near our high school?

136
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,640
Yes.

137
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,650
Why did you bring me here?

138
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,790
Let me find a parking space first.

139
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,530
I've already come with you.

140
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,760
Are you going to tell me or not?

141
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,220
About what?

142
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,110
About...

143
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,810
About whether we

144
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,930
did it or not yesterday.

145
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,310
What do you mean by

146
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,500
"did it"?

147
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,290
So annoying.

148
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,000
Zhang Yiqing, tell me already.

149
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,040
I'll get off if you don't tell me.

150
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,250
You fell asleep outside,

151
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,370
and I carried you inside.

152
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,310
I couldn't have left you out there and let you scare people, could I?

153
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,470
And you spilled wine on yourself,

154
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,750
so I had to help you change.

155
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,430
Or else you'd have to dirty the hotel bed.

156
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,800
So all we did was...

157
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,100
Changing my clothes?

158
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,630
Do you expect us to have done something else?

159
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,520
There's a parking space ahead.

160
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,550
What era is this?

161
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,170
Why are there still people physically reserving a parking space?

162
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,130
He took my parking space.

163
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,270
Of course I should honk at him.

164
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,980
What are you doing?

165
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,220
He took your parking space.

166
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,280
Of course we should honk at him.

167
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,670
Forget it.

168
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,070
I parked too slowly myself.

169
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,950
You're just too steady and slow.

170
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,260
You never ran a yellow light,

171
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,260
never sped, and never got a ticket.

172
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,030
You never handed in any assignments late, skipped any classes,

173
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,730
and you were always top three for every exam.

174
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,930
Don't you think your life is too boring,

175
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,670
Zhang Yiqing?

176
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,600
Are you upset about

177
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,490
me scolding you in the car last time?

178
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,730
All I care about is whether

179
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,690
you like me better the way I am now.

180
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,630
Do you know the difference

181
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,660
between a big tree and a small tree?

182
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,300
I don't.

183
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,870
They're both planted in the ground.

184
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,050
True.

185
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,120
You're boring.

186
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,070
Wait a moment.

187
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,130
I need to take this.

188
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,850
♫I want to grow closer to you day by day♫

189
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,620
♫I want to write a diary together with you♫

190

194
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,840

198
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,810
Thank you.

199
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:31,860
Thank you.

200
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,150
Ian?

201
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,420
You must have waited long.

202
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,510
I'm back.

203
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,550
Why didn't you tell me in advance

204
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,980
that you were coming back from abroad?

205
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,990
I asked Tang Duzhi to keep it a secret.

206
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,110
I wanted to give you a surprise.

207
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,380
Ian's company has always been working closely

208
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,930
with Hongze Funeral Directors.

209
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,340
Back in high school,

210
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,200
we got assigned to the same group for assignments a lot, didn't we?

211
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,240
We have great chemistry.

212
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,260
I told your brother that

213
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,990
if you're willing to take over,

214
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,400
I'll definitely have your back.

215
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,680
It's just...

216
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,930
Do you really want to take over?

217
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,470
When you were watching the performance just now,

218
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,790
you were so focused.

219
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,840
What about your music dream?

220
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,470
I...

221
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,710
I'm not sure yet.

222
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,700
It's okay.

223
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,670
No matter what decision you make,

224
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,230
I'll support you all the way.

225
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,210
Ian just got his MBA degree from the US.

226
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,800
So he'll share his knowledge and information

227
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,710
on corporate management with you.

228
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,210
So he'll participate in the upcoming training sessions

229
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,599
together with us.

230
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,210
Together?

231
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,470
So,

232
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,290
you'll be living with us?

233
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,460
Yes, this is the second surprise.

234
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,460
I just made a reservation at a restaurant.

235
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,460
Let's talk over dinner.

236
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,120
Okay, let me see.

237
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,570
I think this restaurant

238
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,170
is a bit too formal.

239
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,910
I suddenly thought of a restaurant I've been dying to eat at.

240
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,420
For nostalgic reasons.

241
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,070
Can we go to that restaurant instead?

242
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,380
I'm sorry.

243
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,060
I didn't look into your preferences in advance.

244
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,330
It's up to you.

245
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,520
It's okay.

246
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,400
Let's go. I'll take you to eat.

247
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,160
Don't you think he's a bit too serious?

248
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,250
He just looks that way.

249
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,330
You'll see later.

250
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,250
This brings back memories.

251
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,830
It's really been a long time.

252
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,110
Look, the wall has been renovated.

253
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,040
When you climbed up that wall,

254
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,000
I always felt it would collapse.

255
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,410
At that time, I wasn't afraid of anything

256
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,430
but being caught by that instructor.

257
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,880
You were afraid of the math teacher too, okay?

258
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,960
Every time you forgot to do your homework,

259
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,920
you asked me to help you.

260
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,100
Not every time, okay?

261
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,530
By the way, you were too slow.

262
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,140
It was because of you that I almost got caught by the instructor.

263
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,660
I was too slow?

264
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,500
Yeah.

265
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,400
Let's have a race now if you dare.

266
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,810
Why did you start early?

267
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,030
Is this the restaurant you want to eat at?

268
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,290
Yes, I haven't been here for a long time.

269
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,700
I missed it.

270
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,730
Let's eat.

271
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,530
Wang Zhan, listen.

272
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,500
You should mix the braised pork rice like this,

273
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,030
so that the braising sauce evenly coats each grain of rice.

274
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,750
Only then can you truly taste how delicious it is.

275
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,960
Let me mix it for you.

276
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,860
Here, try it.

277
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,090
Thank you.

278
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:45,950
How is it?

279
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,700
Not bad.

280
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,490
Right?

281
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,540
Try mixing too.

282
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,680
It's really delicious.

283
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,090
Just enjoy your meal.

284
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,850
Don't mind me.

285
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,510
So you're the type who doesn't mix it?

286
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,320
The truly delicious way to eat braised pork rice

287
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,260
is definitely not to mix it.

288
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,260
Is this going to be a food war?

289
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,260
Only by not mixing can the texture of the braised meat be preserved

290
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,880
and the rice grains be distinct,

291
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,760
so that they taste crisp.

292
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,480
I'm telling you, braised pork rice needs to be mixed

293
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,880
to truly savor its ultimate deliciousness.

294
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,380
If you mix it all together,

295
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,960
wouldn't the soul of the food be lost?

296
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,050
Just trust me this once.

297
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,280
You won't be disappointed.

298
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,960
Just mix it once.

299
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,980
That's what I insist on.

300
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,230
It's the same with everything.

301
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,010
Boss.

302
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,330
I want another bowl of braised pork rice.

303
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,130
Okay. Right away.

304
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,640
I'll try both.

305
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,450
Is it good?

306
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,170
Yes.

307
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,920
Sir, two more bowls of curry rice, please.

308
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,950
Okay, right away.

309
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,090
Curry rice?

310
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,670
Are you serious?

311
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,530
Yes.

312
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,380
Boss, another bowl.

313
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,960
Gifted student.

314
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,960
Why are you sitting here alone?

315
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,210
You have good grades, so what?

316
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,130
I'm talking to you.

317
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,630
I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

318
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:45,980
What are you doing?

319
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,140
It's none of your business.

320
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,330
I'll teach you a million lessons.

321
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,040
What?

322
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,600
-Stop it!
-What?

323
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,840
It's none of your business!

324
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,440
Don't touch me!

325
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,110
Who are you?

326
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,480
Let's talk calmly. Who are you?

327
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,880
Who gave you the courage to hit me?

328
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,730
What? It's none of your business!

329
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,950
You don't have to fight, do you?

330
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,960
Talk calmly, okay?

331
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,890
Why did you act so tough back then?

332
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,390
To support you.

333
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,080
We used to like this place a lot.

334
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,360
But after that incident,

335
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,970
we seldom came here.

336
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,390
Come to think of it,

337
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,360
we might have missed 102 times.

338
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:31,970
No.

339
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,720
It should be 101 times.

340
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,910
We can count it as one less today.

341
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,030
You're really boring.

342
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,490
What did you want

343
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,910
to tell me at that time?

344
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,990
I wanted to tell you...

345
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,260
That I liked you.

346
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,000
It's just I didn't expect

347
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,690
you to tell your classmate

348
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,650
that we were just friends.

349
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,420
I feel like you've been very close lately.

350
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,620
Is he...

351
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,760
Don't talk nonsense.

352
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,410
We're just...

353
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,620
We're just friends, okay?

354
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,700
From then on,

355
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,220
I believed we were just friends.

356
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,750
If I had said something,

357
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,490
perhaps

358
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,620
I wouldn't have to work so hard

359
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,850
for your wedding now.

360
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,210
But I won't give up.

361
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,790
It was a misunderstanding back then.

362
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,370
But now I believe more in

363
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,660
seizing opportunities.

364
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,500
This place is nice.

365
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,270
Your room is upstairs,

366
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,610
next to Wang Zhan's room.

367
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,900
Wang Zhan, you live next door?

368
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,590
Yes.

369
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,760
If you want to know anything,

370
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,090
you can come to me anytime.

371
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,840
You're afraid of those things, right?

372
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,030
Don't be afraid.

373
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,390
I'm here.

374
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,200
After more than a month of training

375
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,390
and diet,

376
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,800
Wang Zhan's fear of blood

377
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,900
and those things

378
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,890
has improved a lot.

379
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,640
Since I'm here,

380
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,390
I want to help Wang Zhan more.

381
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,890
Although Yingxiu agreed to let you join,

382
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,880
I'm still the one responsible for

383
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,030
everything about Wang Zhan here.

384
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,890
No problem. You make the call.

385
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,890
But I want to remind you that

386
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,890
if you put too much pressure on people,

387
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,930
it can backfire.

388
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,260
Yingxiu, I'm sorry.

389
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,440
Our personalities are really incompatible.

390
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,830
We might have conflicts in future training sessions.

391
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,390
It's okay.

392
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,750
As long as it helps Wang Zhan mature,

393
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,930
it's a good thing.

394
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,630
It's just

395
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,400
you seem to have a problem with Ian.

396
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,090
I'll adjust myself.

397
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,990
You don't have many friends.

398
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,190
I hope you can become good friends

399
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,940
through this opportunity.

400
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,010
It's the best timing for you to talk.

401
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,370
What?

402
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,960
[Birthday: November 8, 1999]

403
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,990
The best timing to talk...

404
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,860
How should I talk to him?

405
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,670
I don't even know

406
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,400
what gift

407
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,630
I should give to Tang Duzhi.

408
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,290
It's you then.

409
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,560
What do you think of

410
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,820
Zhicun's venue we visited today?

411
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:08,940
Not bad.

412
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,430
It's environmentally friendly.

413
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,360
Have you been sleeping late lately?

414
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,640
No.

415
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,970
Funeral director companies have great business potential.

416
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,860
Like Hongze,

417
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,420
there are many investors who are eager to try.

418
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,440
Look. This boss is

419
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,180
Mr. Zhuang.

420
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,920
He's very interested in Hongze.

421
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,340
Wang Zhan, you know, corporate management

422
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,230
is like a master telling a cat to catch a mouse.

423
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,790
The mouse runs for its life,

424
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,040
so why do I run?

425
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,520
The signing of pre-need contracts, as well as the sale

426
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,730
and pre-sale of cemeteries and columbaria.

427
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,550
Not bad.

428
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,970
Next, you can get ready to take over

429
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:34,980
and take the exam for your license.

430
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,460
Let's continue.

431
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,850
Give bonuses to employees,

432
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,800
so that they'll work hard for you.

433
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,730
That's right.

434
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,700
Well done.

435
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,950
You're awake.

436
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:17,900
I fell asleep?

437
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,540
You're not waiting for me to wake up myself,

438
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,290
are you?

439
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,400
We just arrived.

440
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,590
I was just about to wake you up when you woke up on your own.

441
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,980
Thanks.

442
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,270
I'm going out next Saturday afternoon.

443
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,440
Family affairs.

444
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,410
I'll be back at night.

445
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,720
Next Saturday?

446
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,630
[Tang Duzhi's birthday]

447
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,000
His birthday?

448
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,530
Is he going out to celebrate his birthday?

449
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,500
[Exclusive Love Epilogue]

450
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,570
It was a misunderstanding back then.

451
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,170
But now I believe more in

452
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,330
seizing opportunities.
