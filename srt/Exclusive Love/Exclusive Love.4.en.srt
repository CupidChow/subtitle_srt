[Exclusive Love]

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,820
[Episode 4: The past that's difficult to talk about]

3
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:36,940
Tang Duzhi.

4
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,729
What are you doing?

5
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,340
What if you get hit?

6
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,400
If I hadn't saved you, you'd have been hit by the car!

7
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,600
Tang Duzhi.

8
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,400
Are you okay?

9
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,590
What?

10
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,310
You were standing in the middle of the road just now,

11
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,450
and now you look so pale.

12
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,200
I thought I should come ask how you are.

13
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,620
When I'm in a bad mood,

14
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,770
I'd do something to vent my anger.

15
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,770
For example, like talking to Yiqing and Jinghe

16
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,770
or yell somewhere with no one else.

17
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,540
There's no point in talking about things

18
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,490
that can't be changed.

19
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,940
Tang Duzhi!

20
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,360
Don't keep your sadness to yourself!

21
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,270
Toss away your sadness!

22
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,880
Don't you think that will make you feel better?

23
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,400
Thank you.

24
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,050
What for?

25
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,090
For just now?

26
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,820
I rushed out without thinking too much.

27
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,140
Thank you

28
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,950
for saving me.

29
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,060
Why is there a concert ticket

30
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,500
in my wallet?

31
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,990
You've been working too hard.

32
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,810
You need to relax.

33
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,240
You're the one who needs more rest.

34
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,570
Understand?

35
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,180
I'm leaving.

36
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,920
Bro!

37
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,270
I wish you could go back to how you were before.

38
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,760
I don't like how you're just working every day now

39
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,890
living a unhappy life.

40
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,980
Taking care of you is my responsibility.

41
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,210
You didn't cause the accident.

42
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,420
It's not like I can't live a good life or study

43
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,750
because of you.

44
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,030
Why do you have to

45
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,170
take responsibility for it all?

46
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,200
Are you okay?

47
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,659
Take your medicine.

48
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,270
Leave me alone!

49
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,400
What's wrong with Tang Duzhi?

50
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,820
I really want to know that.

51
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,100
What's wrong with you?

52
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,590
I think it's okay for me to

53
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,970
cheer him up like this.

54
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,500
You're here.

55
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,520
This cup...

56
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,460
No matter how you feel about me,

57
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,030
it's nothing more for me:

58
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,690
everything I'm doing for you now

59
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,960
is to have you take over.

60
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,860
I have no other intentions.

61
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,429
This is also for me.

62
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,570
I got it.

63
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,570
What?

64
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,470
Your encouragement,

65
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,070
I got it.

66
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,900
[You have been nominated. The final list of nominations will be revealed in a week.]

67
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,810
I'm nominated?

68
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,590
I brought you here today to teach you about

69
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,500
the services we provide

70
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,250
such as wills,

71
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,300
funeral services,

72
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,480
and cemetery placings.

73
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,270
So...

74
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,580
Brother.

75
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,580
You're back.

76
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you.

77
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,150
Kevin.

78
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,700
Take him to know more about the company's services.

79
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,290
Duzhi.

80
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,820
This way, please.

81
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,980
Let's go.

82
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,300
Wait!

83
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,800
Ever since you handed me over to Tang Duzhi,

84
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,510
you haven't contacted me.

85
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,550
Don't you have anything to say to me?

86
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,810
Just listen to Duzhi.

87
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,190
Hey.

88
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,830
This is so strange.

89
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,230
Why do I have to

90
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,570
take over in such a short time?

91
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,060
Did something happen at home?

92
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,720
Or are you hiding something from me?

93
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,740
Kevin, take him away.

94
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,400
Let's go.

95
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,040
Brother!

96
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
You must be curious

97
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,410
why I don't let him know.

98
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,900
I have a brother too.

99
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,910
If I were you,

100
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,040
I would do the same.

101
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,580
I want him to get used to

102
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,220
the days when I may not be around.

103
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,220
That's why I'm using such a extreme method

104
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,220
for him to get used to it first.

105
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,090
I think he might hate me for the rest of his life.

106
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,120
He will understand

107
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,220
why you did this.

108
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,260
There are so many people out there

109
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,730
coveting the company.

110
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,300
We can't disclose

111
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,720
your illness.

112
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,150
I trust him too.

113
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,600
No matter what happens in the future,

114
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,380
he can bear it.

115
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,280
Don't ever tell me!

116
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,810
Let Tang Duzhi be your loyal dog!

117
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:29,770
So cold...

118
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,490
Cut the crap.

119
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,590
Are you not thirsty?

120
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,490
See?

121
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,520
This is how I vent my anger.

122
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,430
But as you said,

123
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,470
no matter how I vent my anger,

124
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,240
it will never change the reality.

125
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,520
Tang Duzhi.

126
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,710
I'm a bad person to my brother,

127
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,450
right?

128
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,940
The most important thing

129
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,270
a funeral director has to do is to observe people's hearts.

130
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,230
From every detail and every sentence

131
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,340
of the deceased's family,

132
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,590
feel what they really want.

133
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,740
So you mean

134
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,730
I don't know my brother well enough?

135
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,450
You

136
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,800
need learn to listen to others' feelings.

137
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,200
What's important

138
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,700
can't be heard with your ears.

139
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,130
You can only feel it with your heart.

140
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,380
But in my heart,

141
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,420
my brother is like a superman.

142
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,230
My dad passed away.

143
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,720
And my mom left.

144
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,740
He was the only one who took care of me.

145
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,040
He was busy with his work and things in the family.

146
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,960
He only slept four hours a day.

147
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,160
He got up early to make breakfast for me

148
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,950
and took me to school.

149
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,600
He really cares about me.

150
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,600
Tang Duzhi.

151
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,600
Something must have happened to my brother.

152
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,500
Right?

153
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,840
The fourth stage of liver cancer.

154
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,100
The doctor said it's not optimistic.

155
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,100
I'm still worried about Wang Zhan.

156
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,970
I hope you can let Wang Zhan

157
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,650
take over in three months.

158
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,350
I only trust you

159
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,980
to do this.

160
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,610
I won't tell you anything about Yingxiu.

161
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,690
I'll only help you take over.

162
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:10,910
However,

163
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,910
no matter what happens in the future,

164
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,910
I'll be there.

165
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:03,200
[Come to my house tomorrow. My treat.]

166
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:03,200
[Are you busy?]

167
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,270
Are you okay?

168
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,660
Are you still mad?

169
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,580
Give me a reply.

170
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,770
Hello?

171
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm Mr. Tu's friend.

172
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,700
I'm looking for him urgently, but I can't reach him.

173
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,330
Can you tell me where he went?

174
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,400
He's working overtime?

175
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,170
Okay, thank you.

176
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,740
How is it?

177
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,140
It's different from what you heard in the music hall, right?

178
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,450
What's going on?

179
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,350
You have time for a date but no time to talk to me.

180
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,070
Zhang Yiqing?

181
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,000
Hello, I'm Zhou Youning.

182
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,460
How do you know him?

183
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,690
It's my duty to do some research

184
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,960
on the blind date I like.

185
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,720
You're on a blind date?

186
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,080
Let's talk outside.

187
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,030
Let's talk next time.

188
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,200
Youning and I are going to have dinner together.

189
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,350
Do you want to join us?

190
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,600
You're welcome to.

191
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,820
I'm so full.

192
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,650
Let's take a walk.

193
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,530
Are we...

194
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,330
going too fast?

195
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,890
I'm just holding your arm.

196
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,050
You're so cute.

197
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,640
Are you okay?

198
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,570
I'm fine.

199
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,470
It's nothing.

200
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,570
That does it.

201
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,320
Let's go.

202
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,780
Wait.

203
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,470
Does your friend have something important to say?

204
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,560
You can talk first.

205
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,359
I'm fine.

206
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,819
Ignore him.

207
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,390
You guys are weird.

208
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,310
Not at all.

209
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,119
Then ask him to join us.

210
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,040
Otherwise, it's weird

211
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,360
to have someone following us on a date.

212
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,150
I really don't have time.

213
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,820
Go back first.

214
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,680
Let's go.

215
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,480
It's weird to have someone following us on a date.

216
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,540
I really don't have time.

217
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,250
Go back first.

218
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,190
Why have you changed?

219
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,870
Do I really have to do this?

220
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,740
Take off your clothes.

221
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,910
It feels weird.

222
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,400
Lie down.

223
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,680
Is there no other way?

224
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,130
Are you able

225
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,040
to observe an actual dead body now?

226
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,410
It's okay.

227
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,720
No need for now.

228
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,720
Lie down.

229
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Feel it for yourself

230
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,520
how to give the deceased a proper send-off.

231
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,340
Mr. Wang Zhan,

232
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,990
we're going to help you clean your body.

233
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,490
Please relax.

234
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,150
After passing on,

235
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,650
the muscle tension is much different from before.

236
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,390
When you're cleaning them,

237
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,530
you need to pay attention to

238
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,870
these details.

239
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,360
This is to let their families

240
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,380
say a proper goodbye to them.

241
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,030
Say a proper goodbye?

242
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,580
People handed over their beloved family

243
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,400
to us.

244
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,800
We have the responsibility

245
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,540
to let them meet properly for the last time.

246
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,160
Du.

247
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,710
Come in.

248
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,530
I went out to buy some ingredients.

249
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,540
I thought I could cook for you later.

250
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,540
Sorry to bother you.

251
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,540
We're in class.

252
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,040
There are 10 minutes left.

253
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,580
Go prepare.

254
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,370
Okay, I'll go do that then.

255
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,960
Wang Zhan!

256
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,960
I didn't know you were here.

257
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,150
Sorry, I didn't take you into account.

258
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,730
Lie down.

259
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,120
You were so close to Du.

260
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,380
Who would believe that

261
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,470
you were just having a class?

262
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,970
He came to look for Tang Duzhi for no good reason.

263
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,420
Their relationship

264
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,470
is not simple.

265
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,450
Could it be...

266
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,160
he also likes Du?

267
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,660
He is so useless.

268
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,660
He doesn't deserve Du at all.

269
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,360
Could it be

270
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,580
Tang Duzhi likes him?

271
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,600
Is his taste that bad?

272
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,580
I won't lose.

273
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,550
I want to prove

274
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,880
that I'm better than him.

275
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,150
Du, I prepared this for you:

276
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,370
Japanese fried pork cutlet with...

277
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,770
Huiyu's love.

278
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,490
It's not coming out.

279
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,000
Wang Zhan! Are you an idiot?

280
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,950
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

281
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,670
Let me clean you up.

282
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,910
I... Tissue.

283
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,400
No need.

284
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,330
I can do it myself.

285
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,330
Du, I'll go get your clothes.

286
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,580
Let me put this here first.

287
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,580
You got some here too.

288
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,440
Let me wipe it for you.
