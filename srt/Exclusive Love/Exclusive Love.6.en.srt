[Episode 6: Make a wish to me!]

3
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,789
Du, I was just joking about

4
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,400
throwing his guitar on the hill.

5
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,150
I think that idiot really went there to look for it.

6
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,310
There's hardly any people there.

7
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,860
Don't come near me!

8
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,050
No one can get hurt again.

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,130
Wang Zhan!

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,570

Here's NT$300.

14
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,190
Thank you.

15
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,160
Maybe...

16
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,829
It's because he likes you.

17
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,829
Sir, did you forget your stuff?

18
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,329
No.

19
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,230
I'm sorry, sir.

20
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,250
I think I should go back.

21
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,770
Aren't you going to see Wang Zhan's performance?

22
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,870
Where are you going?

23
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,350
I'm going to see Wang Zhan.

24
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,570
What?

25
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,360
You want to avoid me?

26
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,380
You seemed angry last time.

27
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,610
Were you angry because I didn't tell you

28
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,590
I was getting married?

29
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,800
It's okay.

30
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,890
I'm not angry.

31
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,390
I just thought it through.

32
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,890
What do you mean?

33
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,300
We're going to be late.

34
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,910
Let's go watch Wang Zhan's performance first.

35
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,350

36
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,210
Senior?

37
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,600
It's you again.

38
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,930
I'm not a junior.

39
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,940
I'm your senior.

40
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:49,909
Wang Dan–

41
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,780
No, something happened to Wang Zhan!

Wang Zhan!

43
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,680
Why is the signal so unstable?

44
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,660
What's going on?

45
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,310

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,030
How's your foot?

56
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,510
I don't know why

57
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,580
but I wanted to call you right away.

58
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,140
Do you remember what I told you?

59
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,870
No matter what happens in the future,

60
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll be there.

61
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,560
You...

62
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,480
You're injured.

63
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,530
You look pale too.

64
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,250
It's just a minor injury.

65
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,530
Wait.

66
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,400
Done.

67
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,990
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:59,330 --> 00:06:59,940
It's okay.

69
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,410
Let's go.

70
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,560
Wait.

71
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,870
I haven't found Dong Dong yet.

72
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,630
Ji Huiyu lied to you.

73
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,380
It's already at the performance venue.

74
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,380
He lied to me?

75
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,150
He's gone too far...

76
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,300
Let's get out of here.

77
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,270
The show is almost over.

78
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,800
You got hurt because of me.

79
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm useless. I shouldn't perform.

80
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,000
Be confident.

81
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
You promised me that.

82
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,500
Go prove yourself to me on the stage.

83
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,000
Is it too late?

84
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,500
How do you know if you don't try?

85
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,240
Let's go together.

86
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,540
Be careful.

87
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,430
I'll walk in front.

88
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,180
Okay.

89
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,480
Yes.

90
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,490
It was too late after all.

91
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,970
When I auditioned or performed,

92
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,030
no matter what,

93
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,430
it would always end badly.

94
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,910
Those who participated in the auditions

95
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,780
would even call this

96
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,610
Wang Zhan's curse.

97
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,010
It's okay.

98
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,380
I'm used to it.

99
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,020
No one gets used to things like this.

100
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,940
You're right.

101
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,510
But I couldn't do

102
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,410
what I promised you.

103
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,810
Trust yourself.

104
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,650
Take the guitar.

105
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,510
Put on your shoes.

106
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,060
What for?

107
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,160
The performance is not over yet.

108
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,420

110
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,100
You won't lie to me again, right?

111
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,750
Absolutely not.

112
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,280
Come on, bro.

113
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,250
Although everything you do end badly,

114
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,880
all roads lead to Rome.

115
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,750
Maybe you're suitable to take the treacherous path.

116
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,890
Wang Zhan.

117
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,230
I've never

118
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,200
listened to your performance.

119
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,860
But this time, I won't run away.

120
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,670
Hey, you two are terrible.

121
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,780
Come on, Wang Zhan!

122
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,580
Your biggest fan is right here.

123
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,250

Wang Zhan's eyes when he was looking at Tang Duzhi?

149
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,700
-It was so loving.
-It was so loving.

150
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,610
So damn annoying.

151
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,480
I need to go calm down.

152
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,170
This junior must like Tang Duzhi.

153
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,910
It's like a love triangle.

154
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,120
Which side are you on?

155
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,620
Of course, on our bro's.

156
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,170
Are you alright?

157
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,300
It's late.

158
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,680
Stay for a night.

159
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,080
Or are you afraid that Ms. Zhou will be angry?

160
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,180
No way.

161
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,680
She knows we're friends.

162
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,210
Let's go then.

163
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,660
Yiqing and Jinghe

164
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,310
are so disloyal.

165
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,410
They left before I finished the song.

166
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,580
My brother too.

167
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,630
He went offline.

168
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,830
I don't even know where Huiyu went.

169
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,230
Huiyu...

170
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,450
Why isn't he with you?

171
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,850
Don't you need to find him?

172
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,950
Why

173
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,260
should he be with me?

174
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,310
I overheard you last time.

175
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,720
There's nothing between us.

176
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,810
You misunderstood.

177
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,440
He probably

178
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,660
didn't want to be our third wheel then.

179
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,680
Mr. Tang, I'm sorry

180
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,210
I didn't get to say hello just now.

181
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,140
Hi, Ms. Jiang.

182
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,820
Are you the newcomer at Hongze Funeral Directors?

183
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,890
Yes.

184
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,740
Ms. Jiang is the owner of this manor.

185
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,310
Someone just texted you.

186
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,100
[Thank you for signing up for the Wonder Garden Music Fest. We are pleased to inform you that you have been waitlisted.]

187
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,810
What a coincidence.

188
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,310
Since you're here,

189
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,670
have a drink with me.

190
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,820
Let's have a good chat.

191
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,620
No problem.

192
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,760
Ms. Jiang.

193
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,240
You are drunk.

194
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,880
Excuse me.

195
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,650
Ma'am.

196
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
I’ll take you back.

197
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,800
Here, Ms. Jiang.

198
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,280
Be careful.

199
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,380
Here, your bag.

200
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,150
Ms. Jiang, go to bed early.

201
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,630
Be careful.

202
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,430
Bye bye, Ms. Jiang.

203
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,200
Thank you.

204
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,000
Let me ask you.

205
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,750
Is this performance

206
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,650
arranged by...

207
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,810
I asked Ms. Jiang to arrange for it.

208
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,990
Really?

209
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,900
I just did what I should do.

210
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,900
Don't think too much.

211
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,000
Why can't I think too much?

212
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,200
Why did you help me?

213
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,170
Why did you save me

214
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,400
when I'm in trouble?

215
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,640
Are these

216
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,640
really related to the successor training?

217
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,640
Do you really

218
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,240
not feel anything for me?

219
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,730
Don't you like testing?

220
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,230
Now it's my turn to test my feelings for you.

221
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,730
Let's see if you want to hug me again

222
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,060
or go further.

223
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,579
As long as you want,

224
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,060
I can cooperate.

225
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,410
Mr. Tang.

226
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,080
Mr. Tang, the room is ready for you.

227
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,530
Please come and get the room card with me.

228
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,320
The room looks nice.

229
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,800
I'm going to take a shower.

230
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,800
Today was too thrilling.

231
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,530
I need to calm down.

232
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,690
Calm down!

233
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,020
The most important thing now

234
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,990
is that he helped me so much.

235
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,830
How should I thank him?

236
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,570
Tell me honestly.

237
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,590
Why are you suddenly getting married with Zhou Youning?

238
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,230
I know your family is pressuring you.

239
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,560
But you refused all the blind dates before.

240
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,150
Why not this time?

241
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,500
I think she's great.

242
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,990
She has convictions and is classy.

243
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,300
She comes from a good family too.

244
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,480
I'd be blessed if

245
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,640
I could marry her.

246
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,220
You don't love Zhou Youning at all.

247
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,640
You don't want to marry her at all.

248
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,640
Do you really like her?

249
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,010
Yes.

250
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,510
I like Zhou Youning.

251
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,010
Doesn't that prove

252
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,220
you like me?

253
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,490
I admit that I had feelings for you.

254
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,770
But it's all in the past.

255
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,890
So you still want to marry Zhou Youning?

256
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,610
Yes.

257
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
I want to marry her.

258
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,480
Okay.

259
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,430
Zhang Yiqing, what are you doing?

260
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,250
Texting your fiancee.

261
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,570
Tu Jinghe,

262
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,430
I'll prepare your wedding.

263
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,850
Let's take the bath together.

264
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,130
It saves time.

265
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,570
I just wanted to get some water.

266
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,810
Do you want some?

267
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,150
It's okay.

268
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,500
Tang Duzhi.

269
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,860
What's your hobby?

270
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,570
Is there anything you like?

271
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,140
Places you want to go?

272
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,820
Things you want to eat?

273
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,600
You'd better just focus on the company's business

274
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,860
Don't you have anything you like?

275
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,750
Your life can't just be about work.

276
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,980
What do you want to ask?

277
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:08,980
Be straightforward.

278
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,720
Okay, I'll be straightforward.

279
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,220
You helped me so much.

280
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,640
I want to repay you.

281
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,830
No need.

282
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,360
Just tell me.

283
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,860
I will help you achieve it.

284
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,900
Just like how you helped me.

285
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,280
Tang Duzhi...

286
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,500
smiled?

287
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,280
What was he smiling at?

288
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,450
But he looks quite handsome...

289
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,890
when he smiles.

290
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,990
Hey, what am I thinking?

291
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,690
Zhang Yiqing, turn off the TV.

292
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,560
I want to talk to you.

293
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,650
Zhang Yiqing!

294
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,470
We'll have plenty of time to talk in the future.

295
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,910
There's no rush.

296
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,140
I'd rather you give me bombs and poison

297
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,890
than you helping me with my wedding.

298
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,240
You should be happy that someone who knows you so well

299
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,230
is helping you with your wedding.

300
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,320
No.

301
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:17,910
I won't let you

302
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,950
hold this wedding for me.

303
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,140
I've talked to your parents.

304
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,890
They are happy that I will be planning it for you.

305
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,460
And they want me to be your best man.

306
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,380
Tang Duzhi...

307
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,120
Make a wish

308
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,130
to me...
