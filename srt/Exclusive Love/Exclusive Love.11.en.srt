[Exclusive Love]

2
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,539
[Episode 11: It's danger, but also a turning point to love you]

3
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,090
Cheers.

4
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,190
How did you come today?

5
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,520
I took the subway.

6
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,020
The subway?

7
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,020
I came by car.

8
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,060
How could you drive when you're going to be drinking?

9
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,330
Are you sure it's not your girlfriend who sent you here?

10
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,030
No, no.

11
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,930
I'm single today, nope.

12
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,630
No girlfriend.

13
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,430
I'm single today.

14
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,470
What girlfriend?

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,970
It's Tu Jinghe's bachelor's party.

16
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,700
Why are you pulling a long face?

17
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,710
Tang Duzhi is ignoring me

18
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,710
and my close friend Ian suddenly confessed to me.

19
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,340
My brother's sick too.

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,460
After taking over, I met a bunch of troublemakers.

21
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
How can I be happy?

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,430
You're not happy either, right?

23
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,440
Jinghe is getting married today.

24
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,070
What are you going to do?

25
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,300
This time, helping Jinghe prepare the wedding

26
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,030
is a farewell for me.

27
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,030
I bid farewell to the misunderstanding I had with Jinghe

28
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,760
and expressed my feelings.

29
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,610
Can you really let it go?

30
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,360
I told you.

31
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,860
Even if he really didn't choose me

32
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,380
for his family

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,930
and his responsibilities,

34
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,700
I will still give him my best wishes

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,980
and say goodbye to him.

36
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,960
A proper farewell.

37
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,730
Have you ever thought of becoming a funeral director instead?

38
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,970
Just kidding.

39
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,950
Let's go.

40
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,350
Let's go find Jinghe.

41
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,930
Thank you for coming.

42
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,360
Of course.

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,329
Let's hang out again next time.

44
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,700
Sure. I'll go look for you later.

45
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,570
Okay, come to us later.

46
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,490
My friends.

47
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,390
Thank you.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,040
It's been a long time since the three of us

49
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,300
got together to drink.

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
Let's put the wedding and our work aside

51
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,990
for now.

52
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,540
Here.

53
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,310
It's my bachelor party.

54
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,880
Why are you making it seem like a farewell event?

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,190
He's under a lot of pressure lately.

56
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,070
Cheers.

57
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,020
What shall we play next?

58
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,530
Wang Zhan.

59
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,680
Don't go too far.

60
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,090
I have a snack here.

61
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,550
You have to eat it together later.

62
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,350
But there is a rule.

63
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,100
There should be less than 3 cm left to it at the end.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,290
If it breaks when you're eating it,

65
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,700
your punishment is

66
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,700
to drink all of this.

67
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,050
Hurry up.

68
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,400
Drink more! Finish it!

69
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,810
Finish it all!

70
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,560
Quick!

71
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,760
I feel much more relaxed now.

72
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,310
Thank you for today.

73
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,670
You ruined this bachelor party.

74
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,290
When it's your turn,

75
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,120
we'll definitely mess with you.

76
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,030
I've always been stuck between you

77
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,490
hearing your complaints.

78
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,830
But I dared not pass the message for you.

79
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,060
But since I met you,

80
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,450
seeing what you've been through together,

81
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,540
I really think

82
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,460
you have no reason not to be together.

83
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,040
Think about it yourselves.

84
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,620
I'm leaving.

85
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,250
I won't drink the tea.

86
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,460
I'm leaving.

87
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,610
Are you really going to get married?

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,820
My relationship with Youning

89
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,680
is actually...

90
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,490
Let's say goodbye to everything today.

91
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,240
I want to tell you all the mistakes I've made

92
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,670
and end all the misunderstandings

93
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,620
between us tonight.

94
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,640
Tonight.

95
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,870
Just tonight.

96
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,910
Don't care about what others think.

97
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,850
Listen to what your heart really longs for.

98
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,510
What's important is

99
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,520
for you to feel truly happy.

100
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,940
[Wang Zhan]

101
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,750
You were the one who sent the text about

102
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,950
Yingxiu being sick to Wang Zhan, right?

103
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,020
I was right.

104
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,870
If someone is trying to make it public,

105
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,110
they wouldn't have sent it to him alone.

106
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,770
I asked someone to investigate your schedule

107
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,220
and found out that on the day I brought Wang Zhan to the company for training,

108
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,010
you came to talk to Yingxiu.

109
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,670
I don't think

110
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,410
this is a coincidence.

111
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,510
Yes, that's right.

112
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,840
I sent it.

113
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,010
I brought you here today to teach you about

114
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,930
the services we provide.

115
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,630
Like pre-need contracts, funeral services,

116
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,190
and a place in the cemetery.

117
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
So next...

118
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,480
Brother?

119
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,330
You're back.

120
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,600
Thank you.

121
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,030
Kevin.

122
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,490
Take him to familiarize the company's services.

123
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,140
We can't disclose

124
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,340
your illness.

125
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,200
If something happens to me,

126
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,770
I'll be counting on you.

127
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,720
Got it.

128
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,170
You've been keeping this secret.

129
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,780
So why did you suddenly send that text to Wang Zhan?

130
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,330
What are you up to?

131
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,860
What am I up to?

132
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,810
I'd been keeping it in.

133
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,460
But I kept seeing you hurting Wang Zhan,

134
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,620
yet Wang Zhan wasn't unable to let you go,

135
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,350
so I couldn't stand it anymore.

136
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,580
I can only find a way

137
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,330
to let him know what kind of person you really are.

138
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,870
That you're a hypocrite.

139
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,700
Since you heard it,

140
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,780
you should know

141
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,640
Yingxiu and I kept it from him

142
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,970
because we were afraid he couldn't handle it.

143
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,640
It's wrong to hide it to start with.

144
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,280
You were hurting Wang Zhan.

145
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,030
Forget it.

146
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,030
You're just Yingxiu's tool.

147
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,550
You only listen to him.

148
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,900
You don't know

149
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,040
how to treat Wang Zhan well.

150
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,300
And you treat him well?

151
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,730
Or are you trying to take this opportunity

152
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,330
to keep Wang Zhan away from me

153
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,380
so that you can get close to him?

154
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,510
So what if I'm selfish?

155
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,670
Where were you when he was being bullied

156
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,530
in the company?

157
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Where were you when he was upset

158
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,340
and looking for you?

159
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,760
You always run away when there are problems.

160
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,610
If you don't dare to accept him,

161
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,470
then don't show up in front of him!

162
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,150
Why don't you fight back?

163
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,860
Wang Zhan!

164
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,460
Ji Huiyu?

165
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,200
I've been looking for you.

166
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,640
You scared me.

167
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,220
You're right.

168
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,660
I was wrong.

169
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,180
All this time,

170
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,800
I've been running away.

171
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,930
I'm running away from reality, myself,

172
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,090
and Wang Zhan.

173
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,540
I hurt him.

174
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,170
It's my fault.

175
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,890
For the past three months,

176
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,740
I thought I was teaching Wang Zhan.

177
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,970
But actually,

178
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,150
he was also teaching me.

179
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,120
I can't let him down.

180
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,000
He accompanied me,

181
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,890
encouraged me, and comforted me.

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,800
I promised him

183
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,200
I'll try my best to say goodbye to my past...

184
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,160
and face the present with him.

185
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,900
Tang Duzhi.

186
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,190
I'll wait for you to come back.

187
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,110
Don't think by saying that,

188
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,180
I'll give up on Wang Zhan.

189
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,550
I won't back down.

190
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,750
You're saying it's Ian who texted me

191
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,920
about my brother's illness?

192
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,510
Yes.

193
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,620
Du has gone to get even with him.

194
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,560
Are they fighting again?

195
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,020
I have to go back.

196
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,960
Hey!

197
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,380
Don't tell Du that I told you.

198
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,430
Remember! Don't tell him!

199
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,160
Alright!

200
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:51,960
Who are you?

201
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,880
Let me go!

202
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,840
Let me out!

203
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,910
Hey!

204
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,360
Wang Zhan!

205
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,720
What are you doing?

206
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,660
Hello?

207
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,430
Call the police!

208
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,250
Where are you going?

209
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,600
Tang Duzhi!

210
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,380
Mr. Zhuang must be behind this.

211
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,640
The flowers he sent this morning

212
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,050
must be up to no good.

213
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,670
Can you calm down?

214
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,700
This is Mr. Zhuang's place.

215
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,920
Check if there is anyone or any car

216
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,110
suspicious around.

217
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,980
Let go of me!

218
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,890
Who are you?

219
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,460
Let go of me!

220
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,980
Is Tu Jinghe inside?

221
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,490
Zhou Youning?

222
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,700
Why are you here?

223
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,360
Looks like you had fun last night.

224
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,820
Zhou Youning, it's my fault.

225
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,220
I want to talk to you.

226
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,770
What happened last night

227
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,240
was not out of impulsiveness.

228
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,690
I've liked Jinghe for a long time.

229
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,290
We had many concerns

230
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,890
and misunderstandings.

231
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,690
But now,

232
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't want to miss him anymore.

233
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,480
I know

234
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,050
it will cause a lot of distress to

235
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,380
your family and you.

236
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,530
I made a huge mistake.

237
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,859
But I will face it together

238
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,160
with Jinghe–

239
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,940
I'm sorry.

240
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,210
The person I want to marry

241
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,690
is not Tu Jinghe.

242
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,510
We can continue this act, right?

243
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,520
Isn't this Ms. Vivi, our teacher?

244
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,090
Yes.

245
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,590
I promised my parents to go on a blind date and get married

246
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,830
to provoke her.

247
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,910
What do you mean?

248
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,890
So you already know who you want to marry.

249
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,630
You like her.

250
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,010
We like each other.

251
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,120
But she always says

252
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,370
I'm a rich heiress of a bank

253
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,160
and she doesn't deserve to be with me,

254
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,440
that she can only be my friend.

255
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,100
But who wants to be her friend?

256
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
This sentence...

257
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,760
sounds familiar.

258
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,580
Anyway, let's put on a good show

259
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,280
until the plan succeeds.

260
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,620
I was just like you.

261
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,220
I was shocked too.

262
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,800
Then Vivi and you...

263
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,550
Last night at my bachelorette party,

264
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,110
she agreed to go out with me.

265
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,530
So,

266
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,250
the wedding is cancelled.

267
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,420
I'll take full responsibility.

268
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,330
I'll take care of both our parents.

269
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,520
I'll pay for

270
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,600
what your company has provided.

271
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,720
My ex-fiancée

272
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,950
is so cool.

273
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,880
You're so cool

274
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,420
that I pale in comparison.

275
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,670
You can be cool when I leave.

276
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,790
I've tried to matchmake you two

277
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,770
many times.

278
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,720
Do you think I fall sick that easily

279
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,580
and I happen to need a consultant?

280
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,890
Be happy.

281
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,050
So you planned to break off the engagement

282
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,450
but just didn't tell me about it on purpose?

283
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,100
I was forced then.

284
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,690
Or...

285
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,690
you want to confess again?

286
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,190
This time,

287
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,160
I won't just say we're friends.

288
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,530
This is Wang Zhan's bracelet.

289
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,190
Let's go.

290
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,600
Let's go.

291
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,780
Breakfast.

292
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,250
I'll go get Boss.

293
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,510
I found Wang Zhan.

294
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,040
I'll send you the location.

295
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,310
This way.

296
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,240
Okay.

297
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,560
Are you okay?

298
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,710
Tang Duzhi?

299
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,260
Let's get out of here first.

300
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,800
Where are you going?

301
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,360
Go now!

302
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,750
Ian!

303
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,770
Over there.

304
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,180
Tang Duzhi!

305
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,950
Wang Zhan!

306
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,370
Ian!

307
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,220
I got this!

308
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,050
Just go!

309
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,920
Go.

310
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,920
Ian!

311
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,040
Here.

312
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,910
How did you know I was here?

313
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,920
I told you that

314
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,080
I would help you

315
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,940
no matter what.

316
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,070
He must still be around here!

317
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,980
Find him!

318
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,370
Hide here.

319
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,470
Tang Duzhi!

320
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,300
Let's go.

321
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,980
Wang Zhan!
