Wang Zhan is the best. I want to listen to your live performance.

My live performance?

21
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,790
Have you been to one before?

Yes.

00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,930
That's my favorite place to perform at.

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,230
Brother.

58
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,660
Can't you meet me

59
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,940
in a more normal way?

60
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,990
You ran away

61
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,950
and became a street performer.

62
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,050
You refuse to support me.

63
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,380
Am I wrong to rely on myself?

64
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,980
I'll give you three months.

65
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,409
Inherit the business in three months' time.

66
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,409
You know I don't want to do that

67
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,000
but it's because I'm afraid of all the complications that come with it.

68
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,990
You are the legitimate son.

69
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,220
Before Dad left, he told me

70
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,410
to manage the company until you graduate from university.

71
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,410
And what happened?

72
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,580
You studied for six years.

73
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,910
I have no interest in studying funeral etiquette.

He didn't ask me to take over so intently in the past.

There are two floors in the villa.

88
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,280
This is your room.

89
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,370
Everything you need

90
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,440
is in the suitcase.

this is called emotional flooding.

It's for you to overcome your fear

125
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,590
for blood and funerals

126
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,640
in a short time.

127
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,450
You call that a training?

128
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,370
That ghost was part of it too?

129
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,870

130
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,640

133
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,440
Why are you here?

134
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,150
You kept postponing your graduation.

135
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,470
I've graduated long ago.

136
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,160

137
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,310

141
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,470

142
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,790

145
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,030

146
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,030

147
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,790

Okay.

164
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,610

165
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,370
It's very good.

166

Thank you Mr. Zhang for helping test this venue.

167
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,410
Don't you think I'll be a good wedding planner?

168
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,780
Just be the boss of your construction company.

169
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,370
Don't steal my customers.

170
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,310
Are you hungry?

171
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,790

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,470
Wang Zhan.

194
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,750
Wang Zhan, what are you doing?

195
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,490
Let go of me!

196
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,150
Junior.

197
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,440
Now you know how I feel.

198
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,220
Wang Zhan!

199
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,510
My guitar.

200
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,800
Let me out!

201
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,700
Your brother is so cruel.

202
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,700
How can he do this to you?

203
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,810
Yes.

204
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,770
Where did he find that cold-blooded instructor?

205
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,150
Forget it.

206
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,460
Take me to Park No. 10.

207
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,120
Qing. Are you a turtle?

208
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,910
Open the trunk!

209
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,640
Qing, wait.

210
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,770
Who are you calling a turtle?

211
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,840
That's such an old joke.

212
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,630
Aren't you tired of it?

213
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,020
I'll keep telling it.

214
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,270
Okay, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

215
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,000
Happy now?

216
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,770
Open the trunk for me.

217
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,770
Okay, open it for him.

218
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,820
Since you don't have any fans,

219
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,660
I'll help you.

220
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,930
It's Park No. 10.

221
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,550
Okay.

222
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,400
Du.

223
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,910
He's still not answering his phone?

224
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,400
I still can't reach him.

225
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,400
Give me his laptop.

226
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,470
I'll check where he might go.

227
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,150
Okay.

228
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,420
Thanks, bro.

229
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,220
I love you so much.

230
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,920
Okay, hurry up.

231
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,490
How disgusting.

232
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,300
I'll go first.

233
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,270
I'm hungry.

234
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,550
Let's go eat.

235
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,310
I don't want to hear him sing.

236
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,810
Let's buy some food and drinks over

237
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,850
to support him.

238
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,610
Fine.

239
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,110
I'm still late.

240
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,570
Wang Zhan.

241
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,730
You are...

242
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,730
I'm Iron Man.

243
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,780
You're Iron Man?

244
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,310
I don't look like Iron Man, do I?

245
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,290
That's not true.

246
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,810
You're my big fan.

247
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,120
Thank you for listening to my songs.

248
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,110
Of course.

Wang Zhan.

What the hell!

Wang Zhan, you bastard!

Go play elsewhere!

267
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,960
You can perform here.

268
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,880
Hey.

269
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
You're quite feisty.

270
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,380
Don't go too far!

00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,640
Wang Zhan.

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,590
Are you okay?

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,880
How feisty can you get?

274
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,630
Don't touch him!

275
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,400
What?

276
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:17,860
Are you okay?

277
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,130
Help him up.

278
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,610
Don't you know your condition?

279
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,090
Brother, I'm sorry.

280
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,820
You are brothers?

281
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,780
Brother.

282
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,070
Ask Wang Zhan play the guitar on live streams more.

283
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,100
Bye bye!

284
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,750
Bye bye.

285
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,860
Bye bye!

286
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,160
Sorry.

287
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,770
I didn't know his condition.

288
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,580
Don't you think

289
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,580
you should explain about running away first?

290
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,450
I have to keep my promise

291
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,460
to my fans.

292
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,520
Who is he?

293
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,780
The cold-blooded instructor you mentioned.

294
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,050
Are they your friends?

295
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,920
They helped you escape?

296
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,420
Why can't he come out?

297
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,530
Wang Zhan can be considered your boss too.

298
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,150
Who are you to restrict his freedom?

299
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,420
My boss is Wang Yingxiu,

300
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,700
not him.

301
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,220
No matter what,

302
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,020
you shouldn't force someone

303
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,820
to take over like this.

304
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,220
Whether you like it or not,

305
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,930
this is your responsibility.

306
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,560
Why does my brother

307
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,670
want me to take over so badly?

308
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,420
What happened at home?

309
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,420
I'm only responsible for training you.

310
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,490
If you want an answer,

311
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,480
look for it yourself.

312
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,270
Fine.

313
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,940
I'll go back.

314
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,520
Are you serious?

315
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,940
But I'll tell my brother

316
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,280
whether I want to take over or not myself.

317
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,180
Also,

318
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,890
I have another request.

319
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,090
This is coming with me.

320
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,690
Take off your shirt.

321
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
It's just a minor injury.

322
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,790
I don't like repeating myself.

323
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,740
Even if you ask three times, the answer is the same.

324
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,950
I'll say no, thanks.

325
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,090
Do you want me to take it off

326
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,720
or do it yourself?

327
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,390
I'll do it myself.

328
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,040
It hurts.

329
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,380
Why that force?

330
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,580
Clean up the area

331
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,920
and get ready for dinner.

332
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,560
Who told you to hide my guitar?

333
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
The way to overcome blood sickness

334
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,900
is to replenish iron elements and vitamins.

335
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,440
I have no appetite.

336
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,510
Eat it yourself.

337
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,250
Besides, my hand is injured.

338
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,310
It's not convenient to eat.

339
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,310
Eat with your left hand.

340
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,460
I'm right-handed.

341
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,700
I don't know how.

342
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,730
If you don't eat,

343
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,670
I can feed you.
