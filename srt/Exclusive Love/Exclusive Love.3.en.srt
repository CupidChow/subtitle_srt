[Episode 3: The feeling of a fluttering heart]

3
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,600
He's really not interested in me.

4
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,700
Like he said,

5
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,150
we are just friends for life.

6
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,620
Then tell him what you think.

7
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,650
What if...

8
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,250
he refuses?

9
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,300
We can't even be friends then.

10
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,140
Maybe Qing is like you,

11
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,860
thinking that he's friendzoned too.

12
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,490
If you hug...

13
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,539
and kiss him,

14
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,259
you'll be together.

15
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,510
Hug and kiss him?

16
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,910
Like what you did last night?

17
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,910
What?

18
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,910
You're blushing.

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,060
You're shy from just a kiss.

20
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,910
How weak.

21
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,120
It's not like I want to blush.

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,910
It's a hormone problem.

23
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,960
A hormone problem?

24
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,110
More like Stockholm Syndrome.

25
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,510
Think about it.

26
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,650
He trained you

27
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,110
and abused you.

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,550
Yet, just because

29
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,260
of a kiss from him,

30
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,640
you're blushing.

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,860
If this isn't Stockholm Syndrom, then what is it?

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,360
The more he tortures you, the more you love him.

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,720
I don't believe

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,860
you don't feel anything

35
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,360
when you talk and eat with him.

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,700
Don't worry.

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,800
I won't feel anything.

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,210
You'd better.

39
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,579
That's enough about me.

40
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,450
Think of your situation with Qing.

41
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,290
Bye bye.

44
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,320

Are you sure this isn't your twin sister?

His room is quite clean.

64
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,720
I didn't notice it last time.

65
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,420
What are you doing in my room?

66
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,910
To see what your room looks like.

67
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,530
Don't lie.

68

There's still a long time to go for our training.

69
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,820
I thought

70
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,280
we could get to know each other more.

71
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,510
So you hid by my bed?

72
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,350
I got nervous.

73
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,890
You always pull a long face.

The only family photo I remember

85
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,670
was taken when I was very young.

86
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,250
But since my dad got sick,

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,300
I would listen to music when I'm on the bus,

96
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,780
So all along,

97
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,380
it's music that has been keeping me company.

98

Can I drive later?

108
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,400
I have a driver's license. It's been a while since I last drove.

109
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,880
I want to practice.

110
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,260
In movies, when the protagonist drives,

111
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,630
it's very romantic.

112
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,880
If I don't feel it this time,

113
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,460

114
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,870
What are you waiting for?

115
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,220
Drive.

116
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,470
Stop!

117
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,900

119
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,040
Remember this.

120
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,820
Drive.

121
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,750
Basically, this area

122
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,550
is for the first stage of a funeral.

123
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,680
You need to get familiar with the environment.

124
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,870
Ask any questions you may have.

125
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,020

Hello, Wen.

What's wrong?

134
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,020
Let me have a look.

135
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,370
We need to discuss about

136
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,770
Grandpa You’s funeral venue with his family.

137
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,690
His family wants to hold

138
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,870
a special farewell ceremony for grandpa.

139
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,090
When he was young,

140
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,460
he really liked playing basketball.

141
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,450
We can hold a farewell ceremony

142
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,390
related to basketball for this 80 year-old grandpa.

143
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,910
Basketball?

144
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,070
Do you know basketball?

145
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,900
Of course. I used to be an athelete.

146
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,900
I even know how to hurdle.

147
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,820
I was in the school team.

148
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,840
I can dunk with one hand.

149
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,540
Can you?

150
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,540
Sporty style?

151
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,590
That's pretty good.

152
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,540
Let's plan going in that direction.

153
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,800
I also think it’s a good idea.

154
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,170
The rookie is excellent.

155
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,960
MVP.

156
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,870
We have to do our best

157
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,520
to fulfil what the family wants.

158
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,050
That's the duty and meaning of a funeral director.

159
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:26,750
Yes.

160
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,670
This newbie...

161
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,230
Nice.

162
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,870
My mom wants me to go on another blind date.

163
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,230
I quite like

164
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,700
her.

165
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,310
That's great.

166
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,800
Finally, I don't have to act as a bride snatcher.

167
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,040
Yes.

168
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,070
Maybe I'll get married in a flash.

169
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,070
If you need me to help you plan your wedding,

170
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,190
I'll give you a 50% discount.

171
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,260
Will you stay with me...

172
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,090
forever?

173
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,920
Well, we're friends forever.

174
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,020
What are you doing?

175
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,170
He stole your parking space.

176
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,320
Of course you should honk him.

177
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,980
Forget it.

178
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,760
I was parking too slowly.

179
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,250
You're just too steady and slow.

180
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,510
You never ran the yellow lights when driving,

181
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,520
never sped, and never got a ticket.

182
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,260
It's fine to be robbed of parking space.

183
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,440
Back in school, you also never

184
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,230
handed in any assignments late, skipped any classes,

185
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,850
and was always top three for every exam.

186
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,190
Don't you think your life is boring?

187
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,840

188

Be brave.

189
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,490
Make things exciting.

190
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,250
Is it hard

191
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,850
to make a mistake?

192
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,260
I think I'm doing fine now.

193
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,290
Whatever then.

194
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,580
I'm not taking your car anymore.

195
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,260
Tu Jinghe.

196
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,190
Tu Jinghe!

197
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,690
Tu Jinghe!

198
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,160
Relax. Keep the distance.

199
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,940
S-Slow down.

200
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,090
Keep left!

201
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,540
It's so hot.

202
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,480
Why did you turn on the double signal?

203
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,270
Turn it off.

204
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,620
How?

205
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,670
Sorry, I'm not familiar with this car.

206
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,780
Brake!

207
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,680
Breaking news.

208
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,340
-The police issued an emergency report today.
-What are you looking at?

209
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,150
I told you to drive properly.

210
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,520
There is a thrill kill suspect which

211
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,020
witnesses described to be wearing a white knit top,

212
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,920
khaki pants,

213
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,210
and was last seen in New Taipei City.

214
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,710
The police reminds everyone to stay alert

215
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,340
and avoid going out alone at night.

216
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,660
If you have any information,

217
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,200
please contact the police immediately.

218
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,870
It was the radio

219
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,370
that got me nervous.

220
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,990
Can you buy me a drink?

221
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,770
I want to calm down.

222
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,200
Being in the same space with you

223
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,109
makes me so nervous.

224
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,210
Wang Zhan!

225
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,090
Be brave.

226
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,410
Make things exciting.

227
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,710
Is it hard

228
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,600
to make a mistake?

229
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,920
Are you busy?

230
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,380
Come to my house tomorrow.

231
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,380
My treat.

232
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,440
Stop looking.

233
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,880
This is me.

234
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,950
-Attention, all units.
-Police.

235
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,760
-Please show me your ID.
-The thrill killing suspect has been confirmed to be a man in his 20s.

236
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,260
Please open the trunk.

237
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,910
He's wearing a white knit vest

238
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,940
and khaki pants.

239
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,130
Please keep a lookout for him.

240
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,850
What's in the trunk?

241
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,550
-Sir, this isn't mine...
-Get off!

242
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,280
Get out!

243
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,490
-It’s not mine.
-Get off.

244
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,320
Trust me. It's really not mine.

245
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,100
Turn around.

246
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,830
The thrill killing suspect has been confirmed

247
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,430
to be a man in his 20s.

248
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,980
He's wearing a white knit vest

249
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,290
and khaki pants.

250
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Please pay attention.

251
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,420
Stop!

252
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Stop!

253
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,210
What are you doing?

254
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,030
Stop!

255
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,570
What are you doing?

256
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,450
I was mistaken as a fugitive.

257
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,680
It's him!

258
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,180
Him!

259
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,360
Wait for me here.

260
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,020
Crazy!

261
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,990
I'll beat you up.

262
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,420
Go away!

263
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,840
Don't come near me!

264
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,640
Are you okay?

265
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,080
I told you to wait for me.

266
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,420
I'll take care of it.

267
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,310
How could I ask you

268
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,660
to take care of a trouble I caused?

269
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,760
Then why did you trick me to get off?

270
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,700
I just wanted to practice my driving.

271
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,510
It's so obvious you're lying.

272
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,110
Fine.

273
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,010
I just feel...

274
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,730
Chest tightness?

275
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,460
No.

276
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,780
You have a fever?

277
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,610
No, I just...

278
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,540
You are thirsty?

279
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,690
No.

280
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,690
What is it then?

281
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,490
What are you trying to say?

282
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,760
Can you make it clear in one go?

283
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,430
Last time,

284
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,620
when we kissed...

285
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,570
You were dreaming

286
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,930
and you grabbed me by accident.

287
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,580
That's what happened.

288
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,120
But...

289
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,890
I had a familiar figure in my dream.

290
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,110
He made me feel warm.

291
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,220
I think it's you but also not you.

292
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,410
And every time I get close to you,

293
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,500
I'd feel...

294
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,020
I just wanted to test.

295
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,150
No matter how you feel about me,

296
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,120
it's nothing more for me.

297
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,590
Everything I'm doing for you now

298
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,740
is to let you take over.

299
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,300
I have no other intentions.

300
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,540
I got it.

301
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,080
That's good.

302
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,550
Tang Duzhi!

303
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,570
After the accident, my parents passed away.

304
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,110
My brother was in a coma

305
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,780
and had a heart failure.

306
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,090
I thought that was the end for me too.

307
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,860
Wang Yingxiu, I'm only 16.

308
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,050
You just want me to take over?

309
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,710
I'm going back today for your sake.

310
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,310
I won't go back again.

311
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,410
I'm going to sing this song called "Day Break."

312
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:31,370
♫Find the place where the answer is you♫

313
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,410
♫Which direction is it?♫

314
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,760
But that day,

315
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,100
I felt like at least someone caught me.
