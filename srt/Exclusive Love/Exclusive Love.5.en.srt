00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,240
I'll put this here for now.

[Episode 5: Am I Being Jealous?]

4
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,590
You got something on your face.

5
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,530
Let me wipe it for you.

6
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,650
Du's clothes...

7
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,100
This should do.

8
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,120
It smells good.

9
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,810
Wang Zhan?

10
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,829
Could Jinghe be serious this time?

11
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,230
What do you want?

12
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,600
I want to know everything about Jinghe.

13
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,800
Can you be my consultant?

14
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,860
Zhang Yiqing.

15
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,130
What color does Jinghe like?

16
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,190
Green.

17
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,500
He played a tree in high school drama club.

18
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,040
I hate green the most,

19
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,990
yet they asked me to play a tree.

20
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,230
Is it pretty?

21
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,610
Yes.

22
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,900
This one it is then.

23
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,710
Are you thirsty?

24
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,700
Would you like something to drink?

25
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,660
Tu Jinghe's favorite is sugar-free green tea.

26
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,580
It's healthier.

27
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,100
I happened to buy sugar-free green tea.

28
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,150
Drinks are meant to be sweet,

29
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,140
or they won't taste good.

30
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,750
How much is this?

31
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,790
You don't have to care about the price.

32
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,890
Check out its material.

33
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,260
It's actually worth it.

34
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,430
Look at its buttons.

35
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,490
Tu Jinghe, what are you doing?

36
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,710
I'm just checking the price.

37
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,840
We're almost done shopping here.

38
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,780
I'll go check out.

39
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,090
Youning.

40
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,870
I want to talk to Yiqing alone.

41
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,420
This blind date is just an act.

42
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,760
Is it necessary to act so real?

43
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,120
I'm not acting.

44
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,420
I've decided to propose.

45
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,060
Do you like it?

46
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,080
Are you serious?

47
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,040
Qing, I've found someone I really want to marry.

48
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,050
Wish me luck.

49
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,330
You... Are going to propose to me?

50
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,960
You saw it.

51
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,690
Why were you so careless?

52
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,650
Now there's no surprise.

53
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,610
Haven't we been dating on the premise of marriage?

54
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,900
So straightforward.

55
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,780
I like it.

56
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,440
Were you guys fighting?

57
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,120
I don't know why.

58
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,610
He treats me as a friend,

59
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,170
but he didn't bless me.

60
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,440
Why is he mad at me?

61
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,360
Is it because I didn't tell him first?

62
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,520
Maybe...

63
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,350
It's because he likes you.

64
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,150
Go home.

65
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,110
I'll see you off.

66
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,420
Du.

67
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,060
The way you look at Wang Zhan

68
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,400
is a bit different, isn't it?

69
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,970
Just take care of your own business.

70
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,470
Don't worry about anything else.

71
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,960
What about the last time he fainted?

72
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,720
You were very nervous too, right?

73
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,110
Wang Zhan!

74
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,460
Du, he hit me!

75
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,220
Move!

76
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,610
You were never like this before.

77
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,220
You've always been calm.

78
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,220
This is the first time I've seen you

79
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,470
care so much about someone.

80
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,600
This has nothing to do with work.

81
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,470
I don't have to answer your question.

82
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,200
Do you want me to tell Wang Zhan that

83
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,720
you've been listening to his music secretly?

84
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,980
Sorry.

85
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,970
I accidentally saw your computer.

86
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,370
To me,

87
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,870
he's a very special person.

88
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,180
Why?

89
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,230
Have you known each other before?

90
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,990
When I listen to his music,

91
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,440
I'll calm down.

92
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,539
Those memories

93
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,289
seem to

94
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,620
appear in front of my eyes.

95
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,710
Those memories

96
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,710
accompanied me through the worst times

97
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,430
of my life.

98
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,140
But

99
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,300
I can only keep my distance from him

100
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,580
as a working relationship.

101
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,330
That's also the best distance it could be.

102
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,690
I hope you can keep it a secret for me.

103
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,690
Don't tell him.

104
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,550
Thank you for sharing so much with me.

105
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,380
No matter what you think,

106
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,950
I will support you.

107
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,310
But

108
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,500
I still hope to see

109
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
you be happy.

110
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,010
If you like him, pursue him.

111
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,320
Don't leave any regrets.

112
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,610
I'll go home then.

113
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,120
Qing?

114
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,530
What are you doing?

115
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,750
I'm in a bad mood.

116
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,730
Have a drink with me.

117
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,260
Keep your voice down.

118
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,700
Are you going to drink with me or not?

119
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,910
But there's no wine.

120
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,950
Jinghe's marriage is arranged by his family.

121
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,200
Who are you to be mad about it?

122
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,040
I know I'm in no position.

123
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,190
But for some reason, I'm very angry,

124
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,740
and I'm really worried about him.

125
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,850
What will happen when I'm no longer by his side?

126
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,270
When he works overtime and wants to eat chocolate,

127
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,510
no one will buy it for him.

128
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,210
When he wants to have a feast after work,

129
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,510
no one will cook for him.

130
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,180
He doesn't like driving,

131
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,260
and there's no one who can give him a ride.

132
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,760
He can order takeout.

133
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,560
Is there love in takeout food?

134
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,030
Is there any sincerity in it?

135
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,110
I can't beat Zhou Youning.

136
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,500
Now I can't even beat a delivery guy.

137
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,770
Calm down.

138
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,150
If you care so much about him,

139
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
why don't you tell him?

140
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,420
Because back in high school,

141
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,460
he told others himself

142
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,760
that we were just friends.

[Tu Jinghe]

144
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,440
Qing asked me to come here.

145
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,690
I wonder what it's for.

146
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,690
I feel like you've been very close lately.

147
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,930
Is he...

148
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,080
Don't talk nonsense.

We're just...

150
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,940
We're just friends, okay?

151
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Just friends?

152
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,060
Yeah.

153
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,270
Stop asking.

154
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,480
I'll call him.

155
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,470
He's late, and he's not answering his phone.

156
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,040
Maybe something came up.

157
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:40,740
Let's go.

158
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,250
Something came up.

159
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,250
I can't make it.

160
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,400
Let's go have smoothies.

161
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,590
You misunderstood him.

162
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,430
Do high school students

163
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,740
simply admit that they like someone?

164
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,560
So you mean...

165
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,890
I really don't want to get between you two,

166
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,150
but I can't help but want to scold you.

167
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,620
Jinghe has been dropping hints,

168
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,470
but you never responded.

169
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,740
So he thought you only treated him as a friend

170
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,970
and decided to give up on you.

171
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,220
That's why he agreed to the marriage his parents arranged for him.

172
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,700
It's not that I didn't respond.

173
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,640
It was because I thought he only treated me as a friend,

174
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,470
so I dared not respond.

175
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,970
No matter what you say, it's too late now.

176
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,230
He's already proposed.

177
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,950
No.

178
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,600
If he really likes me,

179
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,810
I can't let him get married like this.

180
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,770
He already gave up on you.

181
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,790
What else do you want?

182
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,410
Then I'll get him to fall in love with me again.

I'm going to be someone

184
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,230

185
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,950
Do you have my back or not?

186
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,290
Sure I do.

Try harder next time.

190
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,700
I really want to skate by like this forever.

191
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,520
I can't even perform at a music festival.

192
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,290
What else can I do?

193
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,180
I'll go home then.

194
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,520
There's no point in talking about it.

195
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,670
Come on.

196
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,090
Cheers.

197
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:18,710
Cheers.

198
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,950
At least you know yourself.

199
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,740
I really don't know what I'm doing.

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,810
Qing.

202
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,369
Qing.

203
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,560
Get up.

204
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,260
What's going on?

205
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,760
Why is your friend here?

206
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,480
You reek of alcohol.

207
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,460
A month has passed.

208
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,460
I thought you've improved.

209
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,060
Look what you're doing.

210
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,960
What makes you qualified to take over?

211
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,110
You have no self-awareness at all!

212
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,660
Yes.

213
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,720
I have no self-consciousness.

214
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,010
I still don't understand

215
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,070
why my brother asked me to take over in three months

216
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,890
and why no one's listening to my music.

217
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,870
I don't know what I'm thinking.

218
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,150
I don't know the direction,

219
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,050
let alone where I should go!

220
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,590
Wang Zhan!

221
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,540
What exactly happened to you?

222
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,060
Pull yourself together.

223
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,700
Are you trying to force me again?

224
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,240
All you think about is letting me take over

225
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,700
so that you can complete the task my brother gave you.

226
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,020
You only care about yourself.

227
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,340
Don't go too far.

228
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,490
Du has always been...

229

Wang Zhan.

231
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,150
What exactly happened last night?

232
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,680
[Wonder Garden]

233
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,450
[Ms. Jiang]

234
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,480
I know I'm mad at myself.

235
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,290
Why would I say something like that?

236
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,460
It seems...

237
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,140
Someone just texted you.

238
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,780
[Thank you for signing up for the Wonder Garden Music Fest. We are pleased to inform you that you have been waitlisted.]

239
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,780
[Dear Mr. Wang Zhan, greetings!]

240
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,180
They said someone canceled their performance.

241
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,250
I've been waitlisted.

242
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,040
No way.

243
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,560
So unconfident?

244
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,390
How can you be the successor like this?

245
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,760
The training...

246
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,000
I want you to go.

247
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,930
Go prove yourself to me on the stage.

248
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,380
You can't do it?

249
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,390
Of course I can.

250
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,200
I'll show you.

251
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,510
Wang Zhan.

252
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,540
I believe in him too.

253
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,930
No matter what happens in the future,

254
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,930
he has the ability to handle it.

255
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
My brother said that?

256
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,200
I hope you can

257
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,140
keep those words in mind.

258
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,840
I also believe you can do it.

259
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,360
Du.

260
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,760
Isn't it beautiful here?

261
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,350
I wonder how it's been going between you and Wang Zhan.

262
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,970
This way, please.

263
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,450
Wang Zhan?

00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,690
Ji Huiyu.

265
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,970
Why are you here?

266
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,260
I'm here to perform.

267
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,610
Perform?

268
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,570
How could Du have let you come?

269
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,040
You must have sneaked out.

270
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,860
He agreed. Go ask Tang Duzhi yourself if you don't believe me.

271
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,740
Mr. Wang, right?

272
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,240
Please come with me for dressing and makeup.

273
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,930
This way, please.

274
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,480
Okay.

275
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,610
You're really here to perform?

276
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,010
Yes.

277
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,760
I'll help you take care of your guitar then.

278
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,440
Go get your makeup done. I'll return it to you later.

279
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,560
I mean it.

280
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,800
Trust me.

281
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,300
Take good care of it for me.

282
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,020
Okay.

283
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,910
I'm done.

284
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,840
Where's my guitar?

285
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,910
Guitar?

286
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,120
When I went out for a walk,

287
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,710
I was carrying your precious guitar with me,

288
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,850
but I accidentally slipped.

289
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,700
So I threw your guitar

290
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,110
in the bushes.

291
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,350
I will treat you

292
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,120
the way you treat Du.

293
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,210
This manor is so big.

294
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,710
Take your time looking for it.

295
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,210
Ji Huiyu, you...

296
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,020
My guitar.

297
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,410
Where did Ji Huiyu throw my guitar?

298
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,510
Ji Huiyu, that bastard.

299
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,320
Wait.

300
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,650
Why do I feel like I've just been here?

301
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,990
Don't be nervous. It's okay.

302

Sorry, I...

Hello?

00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,490
Wang Zhan!

307
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,310
Du, I was just joking about

308
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,950
throwing his guitar on the hill.

309
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,810
I think that idiot really went there to look for it.

310
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,810
There's hardly any people there.
