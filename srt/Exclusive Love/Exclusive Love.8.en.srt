00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,800
Is that enough?

192
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm sorry.

193
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,390
I didn't know.

194
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,450
Now you know.

195
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,690
[Jinghe & Youning's wedding]

196
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,710
[Wedding photo shoot at 7 AM
Jinghe and Youning]

197
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,910
Wang Zhan?

198
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,910
Zhang Yiqing.

199
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,410
It's all your fault!

200
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,880
You came up with a terrible idea!

201
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,400
What do you mean?

202
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,410
Tang Duzhi!

203
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,280
If you're not interested in Wang Zhan,

204
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,190
why give him hope?

205
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,120
It's none of your business!

206
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,320
I told you.

207
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,700
I'll do anything for him.

208
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,970
I've put up with you for a long time.

209
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,180
I just can't stand people like you.

210
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,760
If you don't know how to care for someone

211
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,730
who cares about you,

212
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,160
I'll do it.

213
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,070
I'll take care of Wang Zhan.

214
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,970
I agree with you.

215
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,690
What are you talking about?

216
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,960
I'm not like you.

217
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,880
As long as it's good for Wang Zhan,

218
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,880
I won't have any objections.

219
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,030
You still want to be the good person?

220
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,960
What you should do now

221
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,530
is to stay away from him.

222
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,710
This is the best for him.

223
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,210
In the future,

224
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,550
I'll take care of Wang Zhan

225
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,460
in my own way.

226
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,510
Clean this up yourself.

227
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,950
To your failed confession.

228
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,990
Cheers.

229
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,340
It's a pity that you're a wedding planner.

230
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,680
You really know how to eat.

231
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,390
You know what food

232
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,240
can heal me now.

233
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,740
But why do I just not know Tang Duzhi?

234
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,990
His problem can only

235
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,630
be solved over time.

236
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,720
Just like making instant noodles:

237
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,970
it's only delicious when you cook it for the perfect amount of time.

238
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,220
So I should give up

239
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,630
and keep things professional between the two of us?

240
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,150
I want you to spend it with him,

241
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,220
not to give up.

242
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,490
Jinghe's getting married now

243
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,990
but I didn't give up either.

244
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,490
So promise me,

245
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,800
you can't give up either.

246
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:36,900
Wang Zhan.

247
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,270
You must be hungry.

248
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,230
Let's go eat something.

249
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,780
What happened to your faces?

250
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,590
We bumped into each other

251
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,670
when we came back just now.

252
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,170
Then...

253
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,730
You...

254
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,100
fought?

255
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,100
It's fine.

256
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,890
After we bumped into each other,

257
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,060
we had a chance to talk some things out.

258
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,670
He asked me to take good care of you.

259
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,480
Tang Duzhi.

260
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,170
Right?

261
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,670
Tang Duzhi.

262
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,870
Is that true?

263
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,250
Get some rest today.

264
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,080
Wait.

265
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,010
I want to talk to you about what happened tonight.

266
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,800
[Exclusive Love Epilogue]

267
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,120
So you were the one

268
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,260
who has been feeding the cat.

269
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,250
How can a cold-blooded person like you feed cats?

270
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,310
I wish you were as nice to Wang Zhan.

271
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,120
Hua.

272
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,250
Come and eat.

273
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,580
What Hua?

274
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,960
It's Ponyo.

275
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,640
I always call it Hua.

276
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,950
It doesn't like this name at all.

277
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,840
How do you know?

278
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,840
Come on, I'm a pet communicator.

279
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,790
I just know.

280
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,090
Please communicate with Hua.

281
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,900
Tell it dinner is ready.

282
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,780
Ponyo. Come here.
