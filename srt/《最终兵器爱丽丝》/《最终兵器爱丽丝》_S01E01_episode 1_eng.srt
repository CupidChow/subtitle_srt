10
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,820
♫  Stay with me  ♫

♫  I'm lonely when you leave me  ♫

♫  Ever since I saw you  ♫

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,090
♫  I can't stop thinking about you  ♫

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,200
♫  I just want to say  ♫

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,201
♫  Hold me tight  ♫

17
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:35,371
 Who are you?

18
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,840
 Me? I don't know

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,665
 how to answer that.

20
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:42,211
 Is that so? Then who am I?

21
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,687
 That is even harder to answer.

22
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,890
 Who on earth are you?

23
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,840
♫  About you  ♫

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,230
♫  I just want to say, I love you  ♫

25
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:08,490
♫  Never leave me alone  ♫

26
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,027
 My name is Seo Yeo Reum.

27
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:17,645
 I'm 19.

28
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:19,989
 It's an age where you are fearless.

29
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,201
 But in my case, I have trouble sleeping.

30
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:26,345
 Because I killed someone.

31
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,840
 The person I've killed...

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,751
 is my mom.

33
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:40,251
 But I didn't feel a thing.

34
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,686
 I just hated her.

35
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:45,072
 It's why I did nothing.

36
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,851
 I could have saved her life.

37
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:55,666
 But I did nothing.

38
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,708
 When I go to sleep,

39
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:16,562
 my mom dies in my dreams over and over again.

40
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:19,607
 Will I have to die for it to stop?

41
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,160

42
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,355

43
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:28,441
 I was minding my own business, talking to my girl.

44
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,194
- It was that prick who butted in. 
 - Sit.

45
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:34,080
- It's true. 
 - Just sit down.

46
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,008
What was it this time?

47
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,268
He was beating up a girl.

48
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,228
So you offered to be beaten instead again?

49
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:41,831
Well, as usual.

50
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:45,690
Have you moved onto thugs now? He's a lieutenant in the Orion Gang.

51
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,327
He could have actually killed you.

52
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,514
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:01,298
Can you please cut this out?

54
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:07,888
Well, I guess this is better than before.

55
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:09,692
You never get hit in the face, though.

56
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:12,134
Because I'm handsome.

57
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:14,261
That little...

58
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:16,164
- Don't look. 
 - A slap on the wrist?

59
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,325
Gosh.

60
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,392
- Would you like to share a cell? 
 - I wouldn't mind.

61
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,329
You little rascal.

62
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:23,623
I thought I did a good job raising you.

63
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:25,975
When did you get like this?

64
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,127
 I became like this a long time ago.

65
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:32,396
 I started taking beatings during the summer of last year.

66
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,500
♫  Sweet dream  ♫

67
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,410
♫  All those summer nights  ♫

68
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,120
♫  Stars in your eyes  ♫

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,519
♫   Dancing in the rainbows   ♫

70
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,905
Here. 
 ♫   Like a summer breeze  ♫

71
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:57,606
Damn it.

72
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:58,832
Come on.

73
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,141
One, two...

74
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:02,627
three.

75
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:08,808
You adorable dweeb. Look at you.

76
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,900
♫   Swaying in the wind   ♫

77
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,231
My friends, you told on me when all I did was borrow a little cigarette money.

78
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:18,885
What's with that look on your face?

79
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,663
It's as if you're going to take revenge on me tomorrow.

80
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,535
Sorry. You, on the other hand, just get on my nerves.

81
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:30,729
Let's beat you a little more.

82
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:42,683
Shit. When did you get in line with them?

83
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:49,833
Your hand...

84
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,043
- What the... 
 - It hurt.

85
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:54,687
Why's he looking at me as if he has a hard-on?

86
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,780
Who the hell are you?

87
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,365
Him? He's the N.O.

88
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:59,159
- The N.O.? 
 - The Nutty Outcast.

89
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,578
No one goes near him since he might kill himself.

90
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,055
So he's the infamous nutjob.

91
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:07,057
Right. That's me.

92
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:09,127
It's a pleasure to meet you

93
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,912
but just get lost.

94
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,498
I'm a little short on money because of these two.

95
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,850
Off you go then.

96
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,944
How was your break?

97
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:21,497
Get ready for round two.

98
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:29,105
Once more.

99
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:31,816
Can you hit me again?

100
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:34,377
You little shit.

101
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,905
I get a feeling I shouldn't,

102
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:40,916
but I'm willing to take that chance, you fucking nutjob.

103
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,212
Hit me once more.

104
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,148
What? You're insane.

105
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,508
Now I get it.

106
00:06:56,508 --> 00:07:00,561
It wasn't that I shouldn't. I just needed more training.

107
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,822
You'll be my punching bag today, Punk.

108
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,089
 I was able to finally understand myself.

109
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,825
 Pain eliminates other pain.

110
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:34,564
 Pain brings me solace.

111
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,889
Hey, stop filming.

112
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:42,979
There is nothing to film. Lower your phones.

113
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,862
More. Hit me again.

114
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,615
That's enough.

115
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:57,168
Okay? That's enough.

116
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:59,195
No.

117
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,997
I'm all right.

118
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,834
I can take it.

119
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,570
I'll stop then.

120
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,614
At this rate, you'll die.

121
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,774
You'll actually die.

122
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:18,240
I'll die? Me?

123
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,467
Why would I fucking die?

124
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,427
If you're going to die, take me with you.

125
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:24,562
Just kill me!

126
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,835
Hey, help him up.

127
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:39,302
Do Gyun.

128
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:40,705
Do Gyun!

129
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:42,347
- Hey. 
 - Wake up.

130
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:43,823
Get him up.

131
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,091
Move, you pricks!

132
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,102
- There's nothing to see. 
 - Move!

133
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:49,145
Damn it.

134
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,940
Bastards!

135
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,785
You didn't even have to use violence.

136
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,353
Seo Yeo Reum.

137
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:59,482
 Seo Yeo Reum. Seo Yeo Reum.

138
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:04,469
 Seo Yeo Reum. Seo Yeo Reum. Seo Yeo Reum

139
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:06,771
 Seo Yeo Reum.

140
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:08,648
Are you all right?

141
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,546
- We need your help. 
 - What?

142
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,756
 They're the top students in my year.

143
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,042
He's right. Can you take care of the school bullies?

144
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,252
 Myeong Tae and Hwang Tae.

145
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:22,278
 Please. We'll help.

146
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,315
Well...

147
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:32,096
How hard can they hit?

148
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,817
Those idiots.

149
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,207
There's only

150
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,351
one rule. You either die...

151
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,828
Or give up and admit defeat.

152
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:50,240
There's no time limit.

153
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,117
Which comic book are you from?

154
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:55,127
You there. Last time...

155
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,542
I couldn't focus because of my midterms.

156
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,069
Attack!

157
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,142
Why won't you go down?

158
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:30,129
- What? 
 - Why won't you go down?

159
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,239
What was that?

160
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:34,608
You little shithead.

161
00:10:34,608 --> 00:10:36,144
I give up.

162
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,646
I give up.

163
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:41,949
He gave up.

164
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,561
Right.

165
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,964
Don't steal their money,

166
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:49,924
and don't bully them.

167
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,859
Because...

168
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:54,054
it hurts when you do.

169
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,156
Whatever, you little bastard.

170
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,996
 Seo Yeo Reum! Seo Yeo Reum!

171
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,089
 Seo Yeo Reum.

172
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:06,150
-  And thus, they found their freedom. 
 - Seo Yeo Reum!

173
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:11,053
 And I started to suffer again because there was no one to hit me.

174
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,285
Do you still want to die?

175
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:20,905
Well, sometimes.

176
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:26,911
- The urge is strong, though. 
 - Yeo Reum, please live your life. It wasn't your fault.

177
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,006
I know that,

178
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:33,667
but I can't help it.

179
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,572
I'm already messed up anyway.

180
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:39,724
What have I been telling you? Get yourself a girlfriend.

181
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:41,643
It'll give you the will to live.

182
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:44,470
I tried that,

183
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,205
but it didn't help.

184
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,949
When? Who was the girl?

185
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:50,901
It was just some girl.

186
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:54,647
And it was sticky.

187
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,711
 Yeo Reum.

188
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:09,237
 Why aren't you doing anything?

189
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:13,009
 You just kissed the prettiest girl in school.

190
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,035
 - That bastard. 
 - It's because you're the strongest.

191
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,978
 Tell me what it is you want from me.

192
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:20,016
 What the hell is wrong with you?

193
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:22,334
 Shouldn't that make you hard? Where are you looking?

194
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,185
 Damn it!

195
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,563
 Don't you know how to kiss a girl?

196
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,648
That's because you haven't experienced true love.

197
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:30,175
Make that your ultimate goal. That way, you'll live.

198
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:34,739
You know what they say. "Only those who love can survive."

199
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:36,189
Right.

200
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,033
Love?

201
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:41,661
Is it edible?

202
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:43,688
I don't know what that is.

203
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:46,757
As if. Of course, you do.

204
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:48,517
Love is like...

205
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:52,171
a knee-jerk reaction.

206
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,676
Did you see that? You can't control it.

207
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:58,060
You'll know if she's the one.

208
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,838
I told you to get rid of that photo.

209
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,541
Then what about you?

210
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,844
- What? 
 - Why didn't you risk everything for my mom?

211
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,056
I was clueless back then.

212
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:44,225
Do you regret not marrying my mom?

213
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:46,433
Very much.

214
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,602
I see.

215
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:51,065
That must be why you're looking after me.

216
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:55,142
Of course. Men should be responsible.

217
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,813
I love you, Yeo Reum.

218
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:38,019
Oppa, it's me. 
  (T/N: Affectionate term women use for men older than them.)

219
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,743
 That's a fatal blow.

220
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,830
 I'll die for sure.

221
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:04,136
 My shitty life

222
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,430
 will come to an end.

223
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,876
What? Ask me to hit you again.

224
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,573
No one's around to help, so you won't be able to.

225
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:25,599
See, you twerp?

226
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:28,787
You shouldn't have interrupted

227
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:30,580
while I was teaching my girl a lesson for cheating on me.

228
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,048
Why are you telling him that?

229
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,962
I had no idea.

230
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:40,481
I wasn't really trying to save her or anything.

231
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:45,159
Are you laughing?

232
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,639
You're actually laughing. Unbelievable.

233
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,644
Maybe we should get him to join us.

234
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:55,554
How about you work for us, you little shit?

235
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:59,492
No.

236
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,277
I'm not interested.

237
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:04,013
Just finish what you were doing.

238
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,823
Fine.

239
00:16:05,823 --> 00:16:08,584
You little rascal.

240
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:14,549
-  Wait.  
 - Damn it.

241
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:17,410
Let's see how long you can hold it out.

242
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,471
You–

243
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:22,139
Who are you?

244
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:26,752
 Strong.

245
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,024
 A strong and beautiful being.

246
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:35,286
Damn it.

247
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:39,782
 And cold.

248
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:51,068
 As cold as ice.

249
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:57,608
 But one that's pretty.

250
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,539
A knee-jerk reaction.

251
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:19,329
What the hell?

252
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,074
Who is this handsome nutcase?

253
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:26,029
Are you bored?

254
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:27,488
Yes.

255
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:30,392
- And lonely? 
 - Desperately.

256
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:34,104
Then quietly die on your own. Don't get others to do it for you.

257
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:36,055
That's easier said than done.

258
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,491
My world is a mess.

259
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,754
Did all the studying finally get to you?

260
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,409
I saved you, so forget it.

261
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,251
My face, I mean.

262
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:06,611

263
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:34,513
 My world is filled with screams and gunshots.

264
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:40,469
 It's broken...

265
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:43,697
 and painted in blood.

266
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,872
Hello, Teacher.

267
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:53,350
Goodness, you must be Han Gyeo Wool.

268
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,626
I hear you're from England.

269
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,830
Your Korean is perfect, though.

270
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:59,914
I still have a lot to learn.

271
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:02,067
With your guidance, I'm sure it'll get better.

272
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,944
No, it's good enough.

273
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:07,071
There are others who are worse than you.

274
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:08,956
They don't answer me back.

275
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:14,646

276
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:18,399
Hold on. Your photo...

277
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:22,087
I heard that my dad had already explained that.

278
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:23,713
Of course.

279
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:28,366
Oh, right. I'm sorry. You were in an accident two years ago and had to receive plastic surgery.

280
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,202
Goodness.

281
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,823
It must've been hard on you.

282
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:35,767
I hear you avoid taking photos and only use your old ones.

283
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,252
That's right.

284
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:41,605
Still, it made me a lot prettier.

285
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,617
What a positive attitude.

286
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,888
Absolutely beaming. You also have good grades.

287
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:53,734
For some reason, though,

288
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,306
you have constantly had the fourth highest GPA  (Grade Point Average)  in your year.

289
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:59,183
 Being in the top three gets you noticed,

290
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:01,352
 and it hurts my pride to come in fifth.

291
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:03,061

292
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,322
- Here is the Nurse's office. 
 - Right.

293
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:08,257
And down the hall is the broadcast studio.

294
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:09,467
Right.

295
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,761
It may be the weekend, but you won't be bored

296
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:16,023
because there are students who live in the dormitory.

297
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:17,928
How peaceful.

298
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:21,696
- What? 
 - Sorry? Oh...

299
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:25,533
Your guitar.

300
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:29,672
Right. I was in the Guitar Club at my old school.

301
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:32,715
Is that so?

302
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:34,592
Are you perhaps interested in comics?

303
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:36,052
I supervise the comic book club, you see.

304
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:37,495
 Comic books?

305
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:41,506
- I see. 
 -  Comic books? When she teaches seniors?

306
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,479
 My name is Han Gyeo Wool, and I'm 19.

307
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,971
 I moved to Korea from England.

308
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,840
 And I also...

309
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,959
 kill people.

310
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:57,516
 An international society of assassins called the Company

311
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:58,993
 takes the children of fallen killers

312
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:03,120
 and brings them here.

313
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:07,191
 And we are trained to be assassins here.

314
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:09,628
 In order to stay alive, we had to compete

315
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:11,130
 and come out on top.

316
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,557
 - Do it. 
 - Get it done!

317
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:16,950
 - Go on. 
 - What are you waiting for?

318
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,220
 Kill her. You won. You deserve it.

319
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:25,818
 When you lose, you die.

320
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:36,012
 But I managed to stay alive

321
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:38,214
 without killing anyone.

322
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:41,751
 And then came an opportunity.

323
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:52,428
 Where will you go, Alice?

324
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:54,981
 There's nowhere to run.

325
00:21:57,742 --> 00:21:59,804
 I thought I had made it clear.

326
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:04,014
 You either kill or get killed. Those are your only options.

327
00:22:04,014 --> 00:22:06,442
 Why would it be different for you?

328
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:08,761
 This is your world.

329
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,288
 You chose to run away while I was chasing that crazy bastard.

330
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:21,723
 Good job.

331
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:25,319
 I've worked so hard to make you special.

332
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:34,929
 How dare you run away?

333
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,166
 This will be your last lesson.

334
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,030
 Shoot me and go.

335
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,015
 Shoot everyone, including your friends.

336
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:50,077
 Why can't you do it? Kill us all and survive!

337
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,130
 Shoot me!

338
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:05,718
 You really are broken.

339
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:18,522
 Then I guess I'll have to dispose of you.

340
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:56,627
 You won't be able to shoot.

341
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:59,430
 It's not that I can't. It's because I chose not to.

342
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:18,416
 That crazy bastard he was after...

343
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,635
 This man who came looking for his daughter

344
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:23,004
 is a killer known as Mr. Ban.

345
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,991
 He ended up in a coma after a botched job

346
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:27,958
 and woke up after three years.

347
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:33,931
 Your daughter Gyeo Wool...

348
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,226
 is dead.

349
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:58,523
 Come.

350
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:03,494
 Let's get out of here.

351
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:19,201
 And that's how I ran from my world.

352
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:22,880
 They're looking for me, and I must hide.

353
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,142
 But when the time comes, I'll be the one hunting them.

354
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:28,370
 Because I'm a killer.

355
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,089
- Seriously? 
 - I mean it!

356
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:34,066
- You! 
 - Die, you skank.

357
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,804
 But first, I need to survive this hellhole.

358
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:42,917
You girls...

359
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:49,158
Forget it. This is Han Gyeo Wool. I mentioned her to you.

360
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:51,025
Hey.

361
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,537
Hi.

362
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:58,191
As I said, they never answer back.

363
00:25:58,191 --> 00:25:59,992
I see.

364
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,654
- Gyeo Wool gets good grades. 
 - What?

365
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:06,532
It's why she's bunking with you, so take notes from her.

366
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:11,221
 This is bad. I'm already in a tight spot.

367
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,914
Let me see.

368
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:15,858
You're a pretty one, aren't you?

369
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:19,511
Do you have a boyfriend?

370
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,681
- No. 
 - I see.

371
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:26,987
There's a boy I've called dibs on. Talk to him in any way,

372
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:29,021
and I'll kill you.

373
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:33,959
Right. I'm not really interested in boys yet, anyway.

374
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,855
 Fucking skanks.

375
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:39,899
 Should I just kill them?

376
00:27:16,328 --> 00:27:18,662
Forget it. My face, I mean.

377
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,348
- You didn't come back last night. 
 - I was sleeping.

378
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:56,458
- Where? 
 - On the street.

379
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,044
Are you insane? On the street?

380
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,705
I actually slept well. Like a baby.

381
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:03,057
I feel fantastic.

382
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:06,027
Good for you. Why don't you keep sleeping on the streets?

383
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:09,230
Then I won't have to suffer because of your nightmares.

384
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:11,717
But who was she?

385
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:13,442
Who?

386
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,461
- Ice. 
 - Ice?

387
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:19,874
- Yes. 
 - Attention, everyone.

388
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:23,177
A very pretty ice.

389
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,040

390
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,092
♫  Alone, here in the dark   ♫

391
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,559
 It's now obvious.

392
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,772
 I chose the wrong school yet again.

393
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:49,477

394
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,781
 I miss the girl from the alley.

395
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:54,317
 Don't talk to Yeo Reum.

396
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:57,628
 He killed someone. You won't be able to handle him.

397
00:28:57,628 --> 00:28:59,056
 She messed up big time.

398
00:28:59,056 --> 00:29:00,923
 This isn't me.

399
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:06,303
 Bring them on right now. I'm ready, you know.

400
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:09,882
 It's not just you. Everyone involved will also die.

401
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:13,178
 I've got a lead.

402
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:17,031
 Then I could take down the bastards who did this to me!

403
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:19,375
 I guess we'll see each other soon.
