1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:17,390

2
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,340

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,700

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,530

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,990

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,040

7
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,447

8
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:49,909

9
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,059

10
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,379
What the hell? Did he fall asleep?

11
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:03,630
So how will we do this?

12
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,623
The usual way.

13
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:07,267
We'll clean things up,

14
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,961
quietly and earnestly.

15
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,957
I found her adorable, you know.

16
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:16,925
She might grow on me soon.

17
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:18,229
Alice, was it?

18
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:19,554
What?

19
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,519
After I graduated from High School, we were going to show ourselves,

20
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,973
lure them to this university,

21
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:56,199
kill them all,

22
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,659
and also die in the process.

23
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,987
Not us, per se.

24
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:01,529
We'd burn cadavers and disappear.

25
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:03,156
And then decide.

26
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,499
Whether I'll get my revenge

27
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:07,710
or live a normal life.

28
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:10,805
That's right.

29
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:15,176
Revenge against those who made you this way.

30
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,313
You don't remember anything?

31
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:20,807
No.

32
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,913
- But– 
 - Did you remember something?

33
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,248
What they want

34
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,217
are me and the list.

35
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,636
That's right.

36
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,956
Then they wouldn't kill Yeo Reum.

37
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,024
They'd keep him as a hostage.

38
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,106
Yeo Reum.

39
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:50,461
Yeo Reum.

40
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,939
Why is it so damn hot?

41
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,535
Who is he anyway?

42
00:02:57,535 --> 00:03:00,338
My... boyfriend?

43
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:03,458
Why were you at a motel when you are high school kids?

44
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,851
Who is he, Casanova?

45
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,753
Why are you yelling at me?

46
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,530
We had nowhere else to hide.

47
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,116
If you were that worried, why not stay close to protect me?

48
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,826
Because you kept causing trouble!

49
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,494
Consider the recent news article.

50
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,056
What I did to clean up your mess... Damn it!

51
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,307
Unbelievable.

52
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:20,567
I never asked you to clean up after me!

53
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,527
I don't seem like the type who would ask for things like that.

54
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:27,150
You did ask me though. You did!

55
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:31,025
You had this in your hand and threatened me to watch your back. You made that kind of scary request.

56
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:33,598
With or without your memory, you're still a brat!

57
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,399
You always do as you please.

58
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:42,863
Thank you for looking after me.

59
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,818
I'll leave now,

60
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,321
so just tell me where Yeo Reum is.

61
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,066
Seriously?

62
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,170
In order to save him,

63
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,599
you'll have to kill them all.

64
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:01,366
Do you think you can kill someone?

65
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,492
Can you?

66
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:12,793
Then help me.

67
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:14,489
I have to save Yeo Reum.

68
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,532
How is this a kind request when I'm at gunpoint?

69
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:18,230
Should I threaten you

70
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:21,051
or make a request?

71
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:22,803
It's your pick.

72
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:36,049
Fine, let's go and save that brat.

73
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:40,220
Just promise me you'll do as I say. Can you do that?

74
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,590
Do I have any other choice?

75
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,468
Once it's all over,

76
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,121
you'll live as Han Gyeo Wool and not Alice.

77
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,817
Even if you regain your memory,

78
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:56,495
getting revenge will no longer be an option.

79
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,130
Got it?

80
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:06,046
I don't know anything about revenge right now.

81
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:09,266
Do we have time to spare though? What if Yeo Reum dies?

82
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:12,220
First, I need to find out where he's being held.

83
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,256
We can't run into random buildings flashing our guns around!

84
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:18,426
Unbelievable. You're clueless, aren't you?

85
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:20,120
Absolutely clueless.

86
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,805
Damn it. All this time,

87
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:26,327
I had to move the weapons alone and install the bombs.

88
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:27,694
All that work...

89
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:32,706
Seo Yeo Reum, that prick.

90
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:33,858
Hello?

91
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,527
Aló?

92
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:38,196
Hello?

93
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:39,622
Aló?

94
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,205

95
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,511
By the way...

96
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,872
why are you still here?

97
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,965
Because of you, of course.

98
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,918
Just in case you kill him.

99
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,053
What?

100
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:20,254
You're wrong.

101
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,073
I won't kill him.

102
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:24,726
Right? You were ordered not to–

103
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:25,953
I'm going to play with him.

104
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,153
What?

105
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,205
You can't.

106
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:31,417
You killed the last one you played with.

107
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,835
Isn't there information you need from him?

108
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,529
I've gotten better at it now.

109
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:40,474
Just give me a few minutes. I promise not to kill him.

110
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:48,975
Do what you want then.

111
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,977
Just don't leave any marks.

112
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,320
He can't bleed either.

113
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:57,099
Right. Thanks!

114
00:06:57,901 --> 00:06:59,210
Noona?

115
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,322
Noona! You can't just leave me with him.

116
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:06,742
Hey, Noona. I have all the time in the world. Can't you stay here a little while longer?

117
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:09,286
Noona!

118
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:10,939
No scars.

119
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,399
No blood.

120
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,859
No scars.

121
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:15,402
No blood.

122
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,153
No scars.

123
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:19,196
No blood.

124
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,161
It looks like both cars changed their plates

125
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,663
and went in different directions.

126
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,498
How long will it take to track both?

127
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,500
A few turned up on the scanner,

128
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,285
and we're supposed to track one of them.

129
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:36,755
Also, we've been getting tips.

130
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,457
Take a look at this.

131
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:57,669

132
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:04,692
Don't tell anyone about this.

133
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:07,070
- Is Yeo Reum really– 
 - Don't.

134
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,822
I'll go have a look first, so call me once you find the car.

135
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:12,783
What are you going to do?

136
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,402
I don't know. Fuck.

137
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:36,124

138
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:23,488
Hey.

139
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:27,801
You're awesome, you know.

140
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,652
You handle pain well.

141
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,292
Ajusshi,

142
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,719
are you going...

143
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:43,165
to do this to Gyeo Wool, too?

144
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,747
If you do,

145
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,467
I'll come after you.

146
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,951
Worry about yourself, Boy.

147
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:25,224
Harder.

148
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,174
Harder.

149
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,703
Harder, you fucking asshole!

150
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,371
Harder.

151
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,098
Up the voltage.

152
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,833
Bring it on harder.

153
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,502
Harder!

154
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:07,199
I can't hold back anymore. It's too much fun.

155
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,585
I'd rather get yelled at later on.

156
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:20,988
 What the hell?

157
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:23,374
 Who is this handsome nutcase?

158
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:33,100
 Being a high schooler in Korea is so fucking hard.

159
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,680
 You said that all you wanted was a beating.

160
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,523
 You're a bully, aren't you?

161
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:41,384
 Should I not give a damn?

162
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:43,327
 I won't bother you anymore.

163
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,912
 Go back.

164
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,648
 The library fantasy from yesterday.

165
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:48,316
 The story after that.

166
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,520
 We dated.

167
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:55,423
 And then we hung out at the beach.

168
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:00,545
 Right. We argued over our crappy grades.

169
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:02,047
 How can you make up for my low GPA?

170
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:04,648
 My grades are worse–

171
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,518
 My heart is in pieces.

172
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,895
 Right. And our parents came to drag us back home.

173
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,381
 You mean the weird older guys.

174
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,700
 That's right. It was terrifying

175
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,203
 After locking us up in the library...

176
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,445
 Do we have to break up?

177
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,481
 - Yes, you do. 
 - Why do we have to break up?

178
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:22,533
 I shouldn't have to get handcuffed and locked up here for dating someone.

179
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,961
 As if you don't know. Love steals your time.

180
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,938
 Of course, I have to hurry up and catch you so I can make you study.

181
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:29,382
 Squashing our love won't get us to study!

182
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:34,377
 After all the time and money we spent on our dates?

183
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:35,805
 Isn't it a waste?

184
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,506
 It is.

185
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,643
 Of course, it's a waste. All of that was my money!

186
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:42,329
 All the money I spent on your books and classes...

187
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,582
 Because of him, I became a credit delinquent.

188
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:47,591
 Oh, dear.

189
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:49,411
 All this over our grades?

190
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:52,012
 - Because we came in last in the class? 
 - Sit.

191
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:56,075
 Young man, how dare you speak to your father like that!

192
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,995
 I apologize. I should've done a better job raising him.

193
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:01,540
 Please don't. I should've respected our different values.

194
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,084
 But I overstepped my bounds in a sacred library.

195
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,793
 The two of us...

196
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:11,415
 are normal high schoolers receiving a public education.

197
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,978
 High schoolers?

198
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:21,067
 - What about that? 
 - And what about public education?

199
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,337
 The fundamental role of education

200
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,240
 is to develop a new mindset in people,

201
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,177
 so they won't become complacent and blindly copy older generations.

202
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:38,316
 It's a new world. Education isn't an achievement, but a tool to grow.

203
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,153
 It's a way to find happiness in life.

204
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,038
 Grades and higher education

205
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:45,132
 are simply options as one navigates the process.

206
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:47,878
 And right now, we are happy.

207
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,679
 And we are in love!

208
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,591
 Sit.

209
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,873
 Hey.

210
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:10,416
 Let's go, Yeo Reum.

211
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:14,587
 A library is no place to search for our future.

212
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,540
 You're right. Our parent's generation

213
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,026
 couldn't care less about our happiness.

214
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,214
 Happiness, my ass.

215
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,190
 You need to survive first.

216
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:33,097
 He's right. Will love put food on the table?

217
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,399
 Think about what's important.

218
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,418
 We're doing just fine, you know.

219
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,953
 What good will that do

220
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:40,630
 when they're trying to kill you?

221
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,789
 Whom?

222
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,534
 Who is trying to kill us?

223
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:47,453
 You're currently on the brink of death.

224
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,389
 Snap out of it, Yeo Reum!

225
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:22,360
Yeo Reum, pick up the phone before I do something stupid.

226
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,479

227
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:33,048

228
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,037
What the hell?

229
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,545
Why does he keep coming back?

230
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,873

231
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:14,715
Fuck!

232
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,362
You!

233
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:03,497
You little shit!

234
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:07,451
I told you not to mess with him, you son of a bitch. Didn't I?

235
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:10,363
- You shithead. 
 - She just said not to leave a mark.

236
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,198
Shut up, you freak.

237
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:26,654
So tell me.

238
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:27,989
Is that your dad?

239
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:30,099
Is your dad a cop?

240
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:35,463
Yes.

241
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,274
My dad?

242
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,377
Yes, he's my dad.

243
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:52,188
My dad. It's my dad.

244
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:54,832
Just so you know,

245
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:58,461
he earned the silver medal for Lightweight Boxing

246
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:01,363
in Sydney in the year 2000.

247
00:18:10,682 --> 00:18:12,283
Geun Dae.

248
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:20,257
Shred him to pieces.

249
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,211
Who the fucking hell are you?

250
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,721
Where's Yeo Reum? Is he in there?

251
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:12,485
You fucking assholes.

252
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,153
By the way...

253
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:16,797
Did you swap out your blanks?

254
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,784
I'm going to shred you to pieces.

255
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,930
Fuck. You little shit.

256
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:29,847
Shit.

257
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:52,995
- What now? 
 - What else can we do?

258
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:16,786
Yeo Reum!

259
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:18,838
Are you in there?

260
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:21,949
If you're in there,

261
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:24,494
answer me, you brat.

262
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,902
Shit.

263
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:11,006
That wasn't even a tricky shot.

264
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:13,643
Stop worrying and stay close.

265
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:48,386
Yeo Reum, is that you?

266
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:01,983
Yeo Reum?

267
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:11,402
You brat.

268
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,364
What are you doing here?

269
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:58,958
Yeo Reum.

270
00:26:03,154 --> 00:26:04,955
Live your life.

271
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,973
Ajusshi?

272
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,779
I should be the one to die, not you.

273
00:26:38,915 --> 00:26:41,617
It should be me who dies.

274
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:45,871
I should be the one to die!

275
00:27:59,537 --> 00:28:01,797
I'm sorry, Sir.

276
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,594
I'm sorry.

277
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:12,108
I don't think I can die, though.

278
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:17,672
I want to keep living.

279
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:24,053
It's just like you said.

280
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:28,441
You said a girlfriend

281
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:30,918
would give me a reason to live,

282
00:28:31,987 --> 00:28:34,438
and you were right.

283
00:28:34,438 --> 00:28:36,732
Just like you wished for...

284
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:41,696
I won't ever think about dying again.

285
00:28:42,747 --> 00:28:44,499
I'll live...

286
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:51,506
and kill them all.

287
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:07,080

288
00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:18,058

289
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:21,829
 He's all I can think about.

290
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:24,138
 Would it kill him to answer his phone?

291
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,425
 Alice!

292
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:27,609
 If you can't escape,

293
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:29,110
 shoot yourself in the head.

294
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,663
 Are you sure you can kill him?

295
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:33,055
 I'll end it with one shot.

296
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:36,133
 You can't miss out on seeing your daughter kill someone.

297
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:37,302
 He's still alive.

298
00:29:37,302 --> 00:29:39,171
 And I know for sure he's waiting for me.

299
00:29:39,171 --> 00:29:41,830
 I'll be right behind you, so get out of here.

300
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:47,094
 Do you still like me after what you saw?
