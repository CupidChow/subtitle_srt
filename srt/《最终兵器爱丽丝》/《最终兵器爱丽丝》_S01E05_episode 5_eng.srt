1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,930

2
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,290

3
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,710

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,490

5
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,010

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,060

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,347

8
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:49,909

9
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,059

10
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:59,859
And you call yourself

11
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,861
a teacher?

12
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:07,233
Fuck. You got me with the edge.

13
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:11,812
Gyeo Wool, are you all right?

14
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:13,331
Gyeo Wool.

15
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,613
Han Gyeo Wool.

16
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,807
Class 3-2, Seo Yeo Reum.

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,982
Yes?

18
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,123
That's no way to treat a teacher.

19
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,649
But...

20
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,111
I'm a teacher, damn it.

21
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,587
Kids these days have no damn respect.

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,589
Are you with her knowing what she really is?

23
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,199
She's Han Gyeo Wool,

24
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,361
a student in class 3-2.

25
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,307
You really had me confused.

26
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,051
I actually thought you were a teacher.

27
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:32,251
I am a teacher.

28
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,824
Are you going to kill me?

29
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,519
Of course, I won't, you nutcase.

30
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,810
You are going to kill me, aren't you?

31
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,262
I said I wouldn't.

32
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,438
Gyeo Wool, run!

33
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,798
You surprised me. I just fell for you a little bit.

34
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:06,727
 Gyeo Wool.

35
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,088
 Gyeo Wool!

36
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,673
 Gyeo Wool!

37
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:16,988
 Where will you go, Alice?

38
00:03:17,747 --> 00:03:19,382
Alice...

39
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,143
She'll come with me,

40
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:25,589
and I'll have you die by suicide, just like the rumors say about you

41
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:27,423
right here at school.

42
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:32,136
My ear!

43
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,691
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,559
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,895
I'll end you both right here.

46
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,536
Let's get out of here.

47
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:28,059
Fuck! Are you kidding me?

48
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:16,916
Who's Alice?

49
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:20,011
Is it me?

50
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:27,193
Gyeo Wool, don't.

51
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,455
You can't.

52
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:34,175
Why not?

53
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:37,861
Why can't I kill him?

54
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,189
He's trying to kill me.

55
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,983
It'll haunt you forever.

56
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:45,335
Trust me.

57
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:47,838
I can live with it.

58
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:50,091
No, you fucking can't.

59
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,011
You're already trembling.

60
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:11,929
This must be my world, Yeo Reum.

61
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:17,151
Do you still like me knowing all this?

62
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,720
Yes.

63
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:22,773
You're really pretty.

64
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,479
Let's run away

65
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,223
from here.

66
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,503
What the hell is this?

67
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,690
She must've won.

68
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,579
Have her followed.

69
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,115
Fucking idiots.

70
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,019
Go.

71
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:13,400
We have to go. Someone's following us.

72
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,917
Hurry!

73
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,612
Who?

74
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,016
I don't know.

75
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:33,402
I almost wet myself.

76
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,501
We can't run around like this.

77
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,878
Let's hide somewhere for now.

78
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,589
Where?

79
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,802
Beats me.

80
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:59,678
Anyway,

81
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,431
you need to wipe the blood off your face.

82
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:05,392
Worry about your own face.

83
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,984

84
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,461
What the hell?

85
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:41,203
I don't know.

86
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:44,690
I really don't know.

87
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,927
Hang on.

88
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:47,093

89
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:50,755
Are you older than me?

90
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:52,742
What the...

91
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:53,792

92
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:57,378
This should be a guy's job.

93
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:00,030
What does gender have to do with anything?

94
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,861
I haven't stayed at a place like this before.

95
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,014
Do you think I have?

96
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,890
Forget it.

97
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,717
Let's go elsewhere.

98
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,220
This doesn't seem right.

99
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:28,709
You've got this.

100
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:34,984
- You're older, remember? 
 - Hey!

101
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,452
Where else can we go at this hour?

102
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,079
You said someone was following us.

103
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,579
Good luck.

104
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,162
It's on you if I get busted.

105
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:57,522

106
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,750
That was easy.

107
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:03,628
Tell me about it.

108
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:05,871
Do I look that old?

109
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:12,704
No.

110
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,915
You hesitated.

111
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,466
I was lost in thought.

112
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:18,943
About what?

113
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:22,388
We're fucked, right?

114
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,875
School is a dangerous place.

115
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:04,398
- And the police? 
 - Nothing yet.

116
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,132
- And Spicy? 
 - On his way. First class.

117
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,709
Damn it!

118
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,805
We have to get her before Spicy arrives.

119
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:15,635
Everywhere he goes, bodies drop like flies.

120
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:19,403
There isn't a line he won't cross. He'll probably take off with the list as well

121
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,314
which means we won't be able to sell it.

122
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,683
That, I can't allow.

123
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,878
Send more men after her.

124
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:27,720
And the boy?

125
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,776
Kill him.

126
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,176
Is this a real bullet?

127
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:46,073
Yes, it is.

128
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,115
No wonder you kept it hidden.

129
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,703
Why aren't you asking why I have it?

130
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:00,546
- Did someone drop it? 
 - What about who I am?

131
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:02,957
- You don't know yourself. 
 - What about Alice and the list?

132
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,792
Are you not going to ask about what's happening?

133
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,650
You don't know that either.

134
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,348
You're too calm for your own good.

135
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,986
You should call the police.

136
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,380
Is that your solution? It isn't for me.

137
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,708
Then contact that guy from earlier.

138
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,553
And say what? How am I supposed to explain this?

139
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:43,163
What's there to explain? Just play dumb.

140
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,600
- As if that makes sense. 
 - Anyway, just go back.

141
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,426
- I won't. 
 - Why not?

142
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:48,509
And leave you all alone?

143
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:56,342
You like me, is that it?

144
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,362
Okay, I get it. I'm grateful.

145
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:00,338
But right now...

146
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,912
That's my handwriting.

147
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,266
What you see are guns, gunpowder, and chemicals.

148
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,527
There are even instructions on how to assemble bombs.

149
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,644
I'm the one who wrote all of that.

150
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:20,591
What do you think this all means?

151
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:24,545
That Han Gyeo Wool...

152
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,214
is dangerous.

153
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,293
Go back.

154
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:33,005
I don't know who they are, but they will kill you, too.

155
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:34,830
I don't want to.

156
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:39,919
Have you really lost your mind?

157
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,397
Why risk your life for me? You shouldn't even like me.

158
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,276
It's not that simple.

159
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,766
"I want to live for the first time in my life because of you."

160
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:54,725
I don't want to die anymore. I've started to want to live.

161
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,914
Back in the teacher's office, I wanted to live so much.

162
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,900
I also wanted to save you.

163
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,462
That's how much I like you.

164
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,301
That's good to hear.

165
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,714
Then you should live. You have a home to go back to.

166
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:23,879
That guy from earlier. Don't you feel guilty at all?

167
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,457
I'm taking a shower.

168
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,958
I want you gone when I get out.

169
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,303

170
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,489
Why didn't you leave?

171
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,128
How should I put it? Leaving a motel without–

172
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:19,128
So you'll pounce on me?

173
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:22,981
I do believe we should do something productive.

174
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:28,613
Call it the survival instincts of a man whose life was threatened today.

175
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,984
So what now?

176
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:38,184
There's an address in the notebook.

177
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:42,143
It's an abandoned school, but I'm sure something or someone will be there.

178
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,921
Let's go together.

179
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:49,318
If it gets dangerous, I'll take off without you.

180
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:52,778
And call the police. How's that?

181
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:57,393
That looks like gratitude on your face.

182
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:59,718
I'm not grateful at all.

183
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,777
- I'll take a shower too. 
 - Hold me.

184
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,730
- What? 
 - Hold me in your arms.

185
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,854
Then let me shower first.

186
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:21,499
Shut up and don't get any funny ideas.

187
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,181
I can see your boobs.

188
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:54,439
Look all you want.

189
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,660
That cut looks deep.

190
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,928
There seems to be something important inside.

191
00:17:57,928 --> 00:18:00,371
One's heart usually is important.

192
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,865
Stop looking, will you?

193
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:05,017
I must've liked being in school.

194
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,678
While leaving earlier,

195
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:09,740
I worried about not being able to study again

196
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,216
and not being able to go back,

197
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,785
even though I remember nothing.

198
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:15,328
I envy that.

199
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,640
- What do you mean? 
 - I'd like to forget a lot of things.

200
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,137
I don't want to remember what happened today, either.

201
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,170
Promise me.

202
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,630
Promise that you won't kill anyone.

203
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,484
I won't kill anyone.

204
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,303
I don't think I can.

205
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,673
Can you keep talking?

206
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:39,760
Let me fill my memories with your stories.

207
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,314
Sure.

208
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:46,550
It's something you already know,

209
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,531
but I killed someone.

210
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,201
That person was my mom.

211
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:56,227
It's not like I actually killed her, but–

212
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:02,433
Sorry. I just didn't want to hear about that.

213
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,761
Don't be.

214
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,096
I'm grateful.

215
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,666
What should I talk about then?

216
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,827
I don't have many happy memories.

217
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:14,370
Well,

218
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:17,297
anything will do.

219
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:20,609
What if we weren't in this situation?

220
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:26,590
What if we had met as normal high school kids?

221
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,851
Normal high school kids?

222
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:30,545
Where exactly?

223
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,955
Well...

224
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:36,259
How about the library?

225
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,378
 What would we be like?

226
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,856
 I'd be the Student Council President who gets top grades.

227
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:44,210
 Not only am I smart, but I'm also pretty and privileged.

228
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,046
 Although admired by the whole student body,

229
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:49,090
 I'm not aware of it.

230
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,818
 All I am is a kind soul who loves books and her friends more than her phone.

231
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,304
 - That's too much. 
 - Just accept it.

232
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:56,662
 What about you?

233
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,890
 You decide for me.

234
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,735
 You're a normal kid who's more into books

235
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:02,685
 than your smartphone.

236
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:07,006
 What's important though is that you like me. Obviously, I'm unaware of it.

237
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,444
 I guess you can say I'm only slightly interested.

238
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:13,179
 And? So you only have eyes for books?

239
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,732
 And I only have eyes for you?

240
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:18,067
 No. What should we do together?

241
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,520
 How about we dance?

242
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,771
 This is all in our head,

243
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:48,856
 so I get why Myeong Tae and Hwang Tae are here, but why those two?

244
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:51,142
 Who knows? They texted and said they had something to say.

245
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:52,837
 - About? 
 - They're sorry,

246
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:54,345
 and will confess to the police.

247
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:55,807
 - How did you respond? 
 - I didn't.

248
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,834
This is exactly why I hate you.

249
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,659
Why do you look down on me?

250
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,380
Being a bully wasn't what I wanted.

251
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,459
But a single fight in Elementary School

252
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:08,409
- taught me of my potential– 
 -  I don't want to hear this.

253
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:10,061
 Mute.

254
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:12,356
How could you not know

255
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,592
that bullies have no stories to tell?

256
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:16,159
But you're one too.

257
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,212
Don't say it like that. I wanted to go to the police, you know.

258
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,573
And to be honest,

259
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,176
thanks to my stunning beauty,

260
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:26,236
- I was destined to date 
 -  Her too.

261
00:21:26,236 --> 00:21:28,304
- ...bullies. 
 -  Mute.

262
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:29,856
 How's that?

263
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,482
 A little better.

264
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:33,694
 You shut them up in a peaceful manner.

265
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:36,237
 Like a true non-violent hero.

266
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:37,847
 A school with no bullies.

267
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,675
-  Together, we go! 
 - Together, we go!

268
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,327
-  Together, we go! 
 -  They're too loud.

269
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:43,846
-  I'd rather we be alone. 
 - Together, we go!

270
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:47,839
-  Me too. 
 - Together, we go!

271
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,967
 So what now?

272
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:52,520
 Then...

273
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:59,877
 How about a first kiss that we'll definitely remember?

274
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,248
 It's too soon.

275
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:12,406
 This isn't how I do things.

276
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,122
Nothing is missing, right?

277
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:56,425
Not that I know of. The other teachers checked as well.

278
00:22:57,652 --> 00:23:01,282
Could the students have fought here? Or was there a prank?

279
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:02,574
Beats me. But it seems

280
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:04,917
too messy to be student-related.

281
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,187
Anyway, we'll investigate.

282
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,223
But I wanted to ask,

283
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,811
last night, up on the rooftop, Yeo Reum–

284
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:16,839
- Seo Yeo Reum! 
 - Ma'am, could you keep it down?

285
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,739
Right, Yeo Reum.

286
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:22,595
Anyway, I was going to check the CCTV footage.

287
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:24,704
Has he perhaps been in trouble or–

288
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,305
Detective?

289
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,190
Can I talk to you?

290
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,009
Just a second, please.

291
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,216
What's that?

292
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:40,478
An ear.

293
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:48,979
Contact local hospitals and don't inform the school of the ear. They'll panic.

294
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:50,322
Of course, they will.

295
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:52,165
What about the cameras in the area?

296
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,225
We've been checking,

297
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,310
but nothing's been found.

298
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,371
So you're giving up?

299
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:01,007
That's why I came prepared.

300
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:04,894
This was caught on the camera by the town hall.

301
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:06,138
It's not much.

302
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:08,522
These two are running away.

303
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,409
Hold on.

304
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,432
You're being ridiculous.

305
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:18,784
How can this be related to the shooting?

306
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:20,795
That's why we should check.

307
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:23,663
The car has to be stolen. It was back then too.

308
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,324
You're going too far again.

309
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:28,119
Hey, it's me. Can you run a plate for me?

310
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,663
It's 285J...

311
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:33,875
 Detective, it didn't come back as stolen.

312
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,518
 It's a valid license plate,

313
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:38,087
 but the car was registered in South Jeolla Province.

314
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:40,047
 And it wasn't registered to the car you saw.

315
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:43,240
 It's the same with the other cars, but...

316
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,050

317
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:05,154
Who's he?

318
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:09,233
Should I kill him?

319
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:12,570
What do you mean kill? It's still morning, damn it.

320
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,551
Hold on. Isn't he...

321
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,521
Isn't that Nam Woo?

322
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:26,426

323
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,398

324
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:06,223
Damn it.

325
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,134
Bro, I'm ready.

326
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,002
Stay put!

327
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:13,756
That annoying prick.

328
00:26:13,756 --> 00:26:16,310
He's the reason I was shut down for months.

329
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,920
It cost us a lot.

330
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,964
It's why I suggested that we move.

331
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:24,667
And dig another basement this spacious?

332
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,544
I would've bled money.

333
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,732
Fuck. I usually don't mess with cops.

334
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:34,118
But he gives me no choice.

335
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:37,754
He has to go.

336
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:40,049
I'm suddenly motivated.

337
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:43,761
Let's focus on catching the kids for now.

338
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:47,698
It's almost time, right?

339
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:49,342
Did you get the photo?

340
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:50,894
Same plate, different car.

341
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,729

342
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:57,124
What's illegal about looking into used cars?

343
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,115
 I'm checking them right now.

344
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:14,842
 I still think that plan of yours is absurd.

345
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,396
 Luring all the killers to one location

346
00:27:17,396 --> 00:27:19,981
 and wiping them all out?

347
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:23,526
 I'm only helping because I owe you.

348
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:26,337
 You may have a location and the explosives,

349
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:28,297
 but it won't work.

350
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:32,678
 You thought you bought time by not making the list public,

351
00:27:32,678 --> 00:27:35,296
 but they'll eventually get you.

352
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:39,500
 Be careful anyway.

353
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,336
 They're after you.

354
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,210

355
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,120

356
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,690

357
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:58,662

358
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:20,058

359
00:28:56,594 --> 00:28:58,638

360
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:06,905
No, don't go.

361
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,726

362
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:22,194
Who is it?

363
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,546
I don't know.

364
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:31,270
Do you know this number?

365
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:40,930

366
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,698
 Where are you?

367
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:46,995
Who is this?

368
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,555
"Who is this?"

369
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:50,265
I asked who you are.

370
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:54,593
Why don't you recognize my voice? It's Mr. Ban!

371
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:59,907
Gyeo Wool, are you saying you don't remember me, either?

372
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,098
I'll ask you this.

373
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,625
Are you in danger right now?

374
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,544
 Just tell me that. Are you in danger?

375
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,714
I am.

376
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:19,737
- Someone's trying to kill us, right? 
 -  Us?

377
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:21,764
- Who are you with? 
 - Hello, Sir.

378
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:23,432
- A boy? 
 - Well...

379
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:25,768
Are you with a boy? Where?

380
00:30:25,768 --> 00:30:28,427
- A motel. 
 - A motel?

381
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,038
- Why did you tell him that? 
 -  With a boy?

382
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,199
But it's true.

383
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,692
- Gyeo Wool– 
 -  Enough about that.

384
00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:35,501
Who exactly is trying to kill us?

385
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,821
We'll talk in person.

386
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:38,614
How could we possibly trust you?

387
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:40,783
 There's a small pouch in your guitar case.

388
00:30:40,783 --> 00:30:43,234
 I bet you have it on you.

389
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:44,996
 Did you see the bullet that's inside?

390
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:47,031
Why do I have it?

391
00:30:47,031 --> 00:30:48,082
To not forget.

392
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:49,799
Not forget what?

393
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,379
I'll tell you that in person. That is enough proof, right?

394
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:56,357
- For now. 
 -  Good. Then listen up.

395
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:58,192
They'll be outside the motel by now.

396
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,636
 Their plan will be to quietly abduct you

397
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:02,380
 since that's the safest solution.

398
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,014
 So if we stay inside–

399
00:31:04,014 --> 00:31:06,309
 Then you'll be sitting ducks.

400
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:08,686
As soon as you get out, run toward a crowded area.

401
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:10,730
- And go where? 
 -  I'm headed to your school.

402
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,740
-  Which subway station is closest to you?  
 - Baegam Station.

403
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,343
 I'll be there in twenty minutes, so be there in time.

404
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:18,020
What if they get to us?

405
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,547
Just run.

406
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:22,148
 And fight. I'll be in touch.

407
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:29,189

408
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:31,934
-  He's right. 
 - Are you sure?

409
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:34,435
 Are you sure he can be trusted?

410
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,563
 What was it?

411
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:37,313
 Are you sure it's this way?

412
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,882
 I'll tell you about your world.

413
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:41,802
 Let me out, you asshole!

414
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:43,894
 Do you think...

415
00:31:43,894 --> 00:31:44,955
 we'll die?

416
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:46,456
 "Let's get out of here."

417
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:48,482
 Are you saying it's my fault?

418
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,103
 Yes, I made her

419
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:53,923
 to become the world's greatest assassin.

420
00:31:53,923 --> 00:31:55,216
 No, he's still alive!

421
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:56,658
 It won't do you any good.

422
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:59,644
 Cry all you want now so that you won't ever cry again.

423
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,856
 You want to know about Alice?
