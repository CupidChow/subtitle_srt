1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:17,250

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,320

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,630

4
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,490

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,980

6
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,030

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,347

8
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:49,909

9
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,059

10
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:57,748

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,798
- What is it? 
 - What that guy said was right.

12
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,969
The car outside is the same one I saw yesterday.

13
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:18,470
Are you sure?

14
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,208
Yes, I'm sure.

15
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,793
Are you sure he can be trusted?

16
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:29,048
Yes, I remember his voice.

17
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:33,010
He's the only one who told me to run.

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,370
- Then maybe out the front door– 
 - No.

19
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,881
They'll probably be there as well.

20
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,159
This option seems better.

21
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,861
- I vote for the front entrance. 
 - No.

22
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:48,583
Just trust me. We only need to ditch one car.

23
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,393
- But this morning that side– 
 - Yeo Reum.

24
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,470
- He was right. 
 - It was true.

25
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,364
Where? Are you sure it's this way?

26
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:29,851
Yes, I'm sure. Just a few more blocks to go.

27
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:32,802
- How many? 
 - A shitload.

28
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:06,570
-  Are you there?  
 - Almost. But it looks like we could get caught.

29
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,398
- Where are you right now? 
 - In an officetel. We've been running through it forever.  
 (T/N: portmanteau of office and hotel; building of mixed use)

30
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,925
 How am I supposed to know which one?

31
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,309
What is the name of the officetel?

32
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:13,593
Which building is this?

33
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,811
How the hell should I know?

34
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:18,255
Run outside, and I'll find you.

35
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:20,185
- How do we know it's him? 
 - How do we know it's you?

36
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:22,552
-  You'll know when you see me.  
 - He said I'd know.

37
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:24,145
- Damn it. 
 - What the hell?

38
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:25,755
Look for a black SUV.

39
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,115
Look for a black SUV!

40
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,131
What was the car again?

41
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,408
Hold on.

42
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,392
What was it again?

43
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,429
What was it?

44
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,785
A black SUV.

45
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,541
Phones.

46
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,621
You two, get in the trunk.

47
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:09,484
But the trunk is a bit too small for both of us...

48
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:14,205
but I'm sure we'll fit in perfectly.

49
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,210

50
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,460

51
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,350
 But

52
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,186
why am I craving music in this situation?

53
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:10,161
I want to sing a song.

54
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,087
I'd love to hear it.

55
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,231
Do you think...

56
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,675
we will die?

57
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,868
Can't we talk about something else?

58
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:25,576
What were you dreaming about earlier? You were laughing.

59
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,903
The library fantasy from yesterday.

60
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:29,456
The story after that.

61
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,690
What was that?

62
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,675
- We dated. 
 - Nice.

63
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:37,096
And then we went to hang out at the beach.

64
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:45,771
 But we had too much fun...

65
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,734
  and it ruined us both.

66
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,239
 I'm 237th in our year. How can you make up for my low GPA?

67
00:06:56,239 --> 00:07:01,143
 And I'm 238th in our year. My grades are worse, so it should be me yelling!

68
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:04,281
 I have the lowest GPA out of all the girls,

69
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,909
 and it's your fault.

70
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,012
 This is all because you seduced me!

71
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,845
 Going to the movies,

72
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:13,924
 the amusement park, playing hooky, and stuffing ourselves with ice cream.

73
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:16,977
 You suggested all of that!

74
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:20,414
 Why did you buy me ice cream? I gained weight!

75
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:26,386
 I need to get into SNU, I'm going to become a doctor,

76
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:29,249
 and make a name for myself at a big prestigious university hospital.

77
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,327
 And at the pinnacle of my career,

78
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,403
 I was going to join Doctors Without Borders.

79
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,106
 Borders, nationality, race, and religion.

80
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,731
 I was going to transcend them all

81
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:40,367
 and devote myself to humanity, but...

82
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:46,190
 But you ruined it all...

83
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,578
 The hope for humanity is now lost because of you!

84
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:50,829
 SNU, where all the white-collar criminals are from?

85
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,556
 Selfish doctors, who won't agree to security cameras in the OR?

86
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,318
 My dream was to enroll in an American Ivy League school.

87
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:58,929
 I was going to attend Yale as a Humanities Major.

88
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,530
 But then

89
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,849
 after witnessing the glaciers melting from global warming,

90
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,968
 I'd decided to become a Greenpeace activist.

91
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:06,728
 Your end goal is to treat people,

92
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:09,256
 but mine is to heal Earth.

93
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,749
 Humans are Earth's worst enemies!

94
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:15,803
 My grand masterpiece of a plan was ruined

95
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,205
 because of you.

96
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:20,342
 And my heart is in pieces.

97
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:23,546
 We just got crappy grades. Can't we just not argue like that?

98
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:26,706
 Really? But we had no choice.

99
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,717
 Our parents came looking for us, you see.

100
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,135
 The cop dude for you

101
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,063
 and the weird guy for me.

102
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,215
The weird guy?

103
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,700
Yes, the weird guy.

104
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,662
 His explosion of anger sent chills down my spine.

105
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,972
I was so scared that I cried like a baby.

106
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:45,650
All that over crappy grades?

107
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,360
 Then what happened?

108
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,500

109
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,285
 Are you curious?

110
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:06,554
 Yes, I'm dying to know.

111
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,407
 Well, after that,

112
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:13,702
 he was dragging me off to some weird college.

113
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:14,838
A weird college?

114
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:16,514
 Yes.

115
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,525
There we were together and...

116
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,640
Die.

117
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,102
"Let's get out of here."

118
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:57,581
You're the one who said that to me, right?

119
00:10:57,581 --> 00:10:59,100
That's right.

120
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,501
Who is that?

121
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,519
His name is Seo Yeo Reum.

122
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,546
Yeo Reum, get up.

123
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,853
Gyeo Wool.

124
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:46,597
It really hurts.

125
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:21,866
Come on. We should go after him!

126
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,623
Fuck you, damn it!

127
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:47,441
 Let me out!

128
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,555
Let me out, you asshole!

129
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,490

130
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,625

131
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,287

132
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,229

133
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:11,359

134
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,641
 Let me out!

135
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,475
Open up!

136
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:39,045
I suddenly have an urge to see Yeo Reum.

137
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,931
You're creeping me out.

138
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:45,150
Maybe it's the beginning of a midlife crisis.

139
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,811
I just want to see him all of a sudden.

140
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,480
You're already doing enough.

141
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,166
The money you spend on that kid is proof of that.

142
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,002
I honestly thought he'd join a gang.

143
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:57,538
Especially when he drove 200 km after stealing your car.

144
00:14:57,538 --> 00:15:00,075
I still can't believe I managed to catch him.

145
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:02,984
Anyway, you raised him well. He's a good kid.

146
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:06,414
The lines are blurry when it comes to being good or bad for him.

147
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:07,949
He doesn't have boundaries.

148
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,809
Nothing scares him either.

149
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,710
Says who?

150
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,855
- The doctor. 
 - Sounds difficult.

151
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:16,098
It is.

152
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:18,635
Being this devoted to the son of your first love

153
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,095
doesn't suit you.

154
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:22,137
It's too much.

155
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,808
I never went to the wedding.

156
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,654
I left his mom at the altar.

157
00:15:29,654 --> 00:15:32,348
And then two months later, she married some other guy.

158
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,592
But he turned out...

159
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,237
to be a psychopath.

160
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,039
He hit her

161
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,816
over and over again.

162
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,627
She stayed with him for ten years for Yeo Reum's sake.

163
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:48,656
It led to depression and mental illness.

164
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,399
And then...

165
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:01,487
 Yeo Reum.

166
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:03,412
 Mister,

167
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:07,049
 I want to die.

168
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,279
 It's all my fault.

169
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:16,909
If only I had married her

170
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,353
and been Yeo Reum's dad.

171
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,566
That's when I made up my mind.

172
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,168
 To raise the kid...

173
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:29,413
 into one who can be loved

174
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:32,033
 and knows how to love others.

175
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,480
Is that the person?

176
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,832
He's not a person.

177
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:41,535
Why? Are the rumors about him true?

178
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:43,187
I hear he does drugs.

179
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,880
Well, that's obvious.

180
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:47,583
Anyway, he's just the worst.

181
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:21,943
You're here.

182
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:24,970
I bet it was tough flying out here.

183
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:39,593
What are you doing?

184
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:42,722
He's under my wing, you shit.

185
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:58,871
But he's been exposed.

186
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,689
We met again quite soon, didn't we?

187
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,661
Move. I'm going after him.

188
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:39,921
That's enough. That kid is definitely dead by now.

189
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:40,864
No, he's not.

190
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,324
Believe me when I say he is.

191
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:44,775
No, he's still alive!

192
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,348
Why did you have to make a friend?

193
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:53,468
I told you not to. I told you that it wouldn't do you any good.

194
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:55,203
Why didn't you just stick to studying?

195
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:57,096
So I'm to blame?

196
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,356
Are you saying it's my fault?

197
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:03,394
Gyeo Wool.

198
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,279
First off,

199
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:08,783
just drop the knife. You must be hungry.

200
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:11,852
I'll cook kalguksu, so drop the knife. 
  (T/N: Kalguksu literally means "knife noodles." It refers to hot noodle soup that was handmade and cut with a knife.)

201
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:15,314
Okay, fine. We'll order in.

202
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,235
Would you please drop the knife?

203
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,989
Cry all you want now

204
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:34,959
so you won't ever cry again.

205
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:37,987
Then

206
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,531
I'll tell you about your world.

207
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:58,799
You seem tired.

208
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,052
I didn't get much sleep

209
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,945
due to the excitement.

210
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:27,970
You feel that, right?

211
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:31,324
I do.

212
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:35,153
I hear she goes by Han Gyeo Wool

213
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:37,505
and that she has lost her memory.

214
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,834
What is she like?

215
00:21:43,144 --> 00:21:44,729
Ah.

216
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,215
Alice, right?

217
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,215
Do you want to know about Alice?

218
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:57,267

219
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:59,494
 You asked about Mr. Barky.

220
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:01,906
 Well, he resides with a bunch of other retired assassins.

221
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:04,942
 Why would they risk their lives for you?

222
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:06,101
 It's not for me.

223
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:09,103
 One of them escaped.

224
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:12,022
 Didn't they also want to shut down the school as well?

225
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:18,312
 That's the only place we can seek refuge.

226
00:22:25,604 --> 00:22:27,597
I didn't know you had one.

227
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,959
It's fake.

228
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:36,355
It's time you told me.

229
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,125
Tell me everything.

230
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:41,537
An assassin?

231
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:43,330
Am I an assassin?

232
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,808
Yes, I made her become the world's greatest assassin.

233
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:48,652
Then has Gyeo Wool...

234
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:50,928
Have I...

235
00:22:50,928 --> 00:22:52,572
killed someone before?

236
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:55,199
I wonder how many.

237
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:58,528
No.

238
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:00,496
 I'm glad

239
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:02,390
that all she did was train.

240
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,892
You ran off before graduating.

241
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:06,035
Before the last test.

242
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:07,137
Before the killing.

243
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,455
Then why do they want me dead?

244
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,198
Because I ran off?

245
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,228
So you know where she has it hidden.

246
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:17,872
Do you remember where you hid the list?

247
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,811
Don't tell me, though.

248
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:26,422
What will you do to Gyeo Wool?

249
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,893
I'll keep her alive until I find it.

250
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:31,118
Then

251
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,506
starting from her toes, I'll slowly melt her body,

252
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:37,408
slicing away at her piece by piece until I acquire it.

253
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,820
She's lost her memory

254
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,657
and doesn't remember where that list is.

255
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:44,707
Just let her be.

256
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:49,537
She won't do anything with it, so leave her alone.

257
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:51,760
Do you know...

258
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,710

259
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,731
why I walk this way?

260
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,992
She ran away again.

261
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:05,836
You won't find her. Even I don't know where she is.

262
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:11,100
You asshole. Don't go anywhere near her.

263
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,947
Don't go near her. Don't you fucking dare!

264
00:24:13,947 --> 00:24:16,573
Stay away from her, you asshole.

265
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:19,176
Don't go, you fucking bastard!

266
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:23,880
Let me go. Let me out of here, you assholes!

267
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,074
What should I do with him?

268
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:28,768
 You fucking assholes. Let me go!

269
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,754
He's off-limits. I want him alive.

270
00:24:30,754 --> 00:24:34,083
 You bastard. Fuck you!

271
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,894
- Him and Mr. Ban. 
 -  Fuck!

272
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:40,287
I want to know which one she'll want to save.

273
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:43,301
You fucking asshole.

274
00:24:43,301 --> 00:24:45,410
Stay away from her, you bastard!

275
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,331

276
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:51,775
 Both cars changed their plates

277
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:53,635
 and went in different directions.

278
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:56,003
 Also, we've been getting tips.

279
00:24:57,889 --> 00:24:59,690
 Whether I'll get my revenge

280
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,694
 or live a normal life.

281
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:03,370
 Do you think you can kill someone?

282
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,797
 Kill them all

283
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:06,697
 and also die in the process.

284
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:08,458
 Then help me.

285
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,118
 I have to save Yeo Reum.

286
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:13,779
 You're currently on the brink of death.

287
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,740
 Snap out of it, Yeo Reum!

288
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,987
♫   Even if you call me for a short time. Alice.  ♫

289
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,888
 Let's go, Yeo Reum.
