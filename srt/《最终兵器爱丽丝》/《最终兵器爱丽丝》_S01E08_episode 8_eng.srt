1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:17,440

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,290

3
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,630

4
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,520

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,980

6
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,040

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,347

8
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:49,909

9
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,159

10
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,786

11
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:17,970

12
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,621
Han Gyeo Wool…

13
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,415
Seriously? Indoors?

14
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:57,193
You damn smoker.

15
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,139
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

16
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:05,151
I'm just biting down on this because I'm bored.

17
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,920
Besides, I never smoked in front of you.

18
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,781
You say you have memory loss, but you nag just the same.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,651
Just keep packing.

20
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,410

21
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:33,638

22
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:36,273
Why isn't this guy answering the phone?

23
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,603
What's up with you?

24
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:51,906
That's not something to wave around–

25
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,942
Yes, he's a cop.

26
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:30,102
 It felt nice…

27
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:34,248
 to receive your call.

28
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:40,613
I was glad that there was someone who remembered me.

29
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:43,824
And…

30
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,181
I'm sorry…

31
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,378
for having no memory of you.

32
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,656
Do you like him a lot?

33
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:08,049
Yes.

34
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,562
He's all I can think about.

35
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,584
Fine.

36
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:29,337
Maybe dating and having a good life

37
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,347
is the best revenge.

38
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,854
Date as much as you want.

39
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,604
What do you think you're doing?

40
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:50,760
Alice!

41
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,313
Listen to me. There's something I haven't told you.

42
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,132
Someone from England named Spicy… He holds a grudge against you

43
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:59,293
and will try to take you in alive. You can't let him.

44
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,137
Alice!

45
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:03,050
 If you can't escape,

46
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,150
shoot yourself in the head no matter what.

47
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,198
Gyeo Wool.

48
00:07:58,328 --> 00:08:00,913
I missed you, Alice.

49
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,105
Do you think I'll kill her?

50
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:46,935
Never.

51
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:49,670
That's why she's better off dead.

52
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:53,241
- Go on then. 
 - The list.

53
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,480
You can have the list.

54
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,105
No.

55
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,242
Do you remember me?

56
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,186
As if you'd leave an impression.

57
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:07,572
But you should remember me.

58
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,558
It's me of all people.

59
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:13,444
After all the love I showered you with and the training I put you through?

60
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,273
And this…

61
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,056
Alice will die, too.

62
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,853
Gyeo Wool, go ahead first.

63
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,115
But what about you?

64
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,234
I'll be right behind you, so get out of here.

65
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,687
You've got to be kidding me.

66
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,500
Go.

67
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,434
Run away.

68
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,231
You'll end up coming back for me anyway.

69
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,170
Don't take too long.

70
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,674
Blow us up.

71
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,202
Why do I think it won't pop?

72
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,901
Is that the best you could do with the kid?

73
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,978
She can barely shoot a gun now.

74
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,373
This gun isn't designed to instantly kill.

75
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:15,943
Where's the fun in dying quickly, right?

76
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,205
But

77
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,908
the Mr. Ban I remember…

78
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,851
She's not even your real daughter.

79
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:25,803
How fascinating.

80
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:29,249
She is. She's my sweet daughter.

81
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,034
No, your daughter died by my hand.

82
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:35,530
I dumped her in the river.

83
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:38,916
Or did I burn her body?

84
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,708
As a mentor, you should've done your job.

85
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,620
Look at her running away, not even able to fire a gun.

86
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,982
This reminds me of her final test.

87
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:01,631
Let's watch her together.

88
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:11,165
You can't feel pain?

89
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,092
Same here.

90
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,935
Ever since that day.

91
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:25,196
I'll make you feel pain again.

92
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:30,242
I'll cut you up into little pieces.

93
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:26,980
Die.

94
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:21,395
Gyeo Wool

95
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,863
Gyeo Wool

96
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,095
Let's go.

97
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:50,716
Let's get out of here.

98
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:45,765
You'll keep on following me, won't you?

99
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:50,653
Gyeo Wool.

100
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:08,537
Do you still like me after what you saw?

101
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:48,144
You seem different.

102
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:52,390
Because Nam Woo Ajusshi is dead.

103
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,551
I need to go.

104
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,754
Take me with you.

105
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:43,749
But I might die.

106
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,276
No.

107
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,871
You're going to kill.

108
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,334
You'll kill them all.

109
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:18,976
Ban.

110
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:22,588
You're not going to die.

111
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,125
Instead, you'll go insane.

112
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,787
You can't miss out on seeing your daughter kill someone.

113
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:31,072
She'll fire.

114
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:34,625
I wouldn't have created a failure.

115
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,538
Alice will kill.

116
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,440
She should kill and survive.

117
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,688
Come on.

118
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:50,491
We were supposed to watch her together.

119
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,884
 He's still alive.

120
00:21:49,884 --> 00:21:52,370
 And I know for sure that he's waiting for me.

121
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:57,725
 That lunatic always told me

122
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,619
 that killing or dying

123
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,348
 were my only options.

124
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:05,266
 He wants to see me kill someone.

125
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:07,169
 Are your memories back?

126
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:10,171
 Yes. Not all of them,

127
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:12,257
 but a few of the good ones

128
00:22:12,257 --> 00:22:14,402
 and a whole lot of bad ones.

129
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:15,987
 That's how it always is.

130
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:19,997
 The few good memories help us cope with all the bad ones.

131
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:21,492
 I experienced that earlier today.

132
00:22:21,492 --> 00:22:24,443
 But it'll only get worse from here.

133
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,278
 I'm okay with that.

134
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,974
 I'm done running, Yeo Reum.

135
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,185
 But…

136
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,246
Are you sure you can kill him?

137
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:38,274
You hesitated earlier.

138
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:42,853
I can do it.

139
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:46,841
I have to end it with one shot.

140
00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:52,930
 Tonight, I'll kill them and make it out alive.

141
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:05,176
If I get caught, though,

142
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,253
will you kill me?

143
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,600
Deal.

144
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:13,091
That was fast.

145
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,486
Well, I heard things.

146
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:17,580
He cuts people and melts them.

147
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,959
So I'll end you instead.

148
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:33,088
 Even though we were off to kill someone,

149
00:23:33,088 --> 00:23:35,766
 we were surprisingly calm.

150
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:38,167
 As if this

151
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,928
 had always been our world.

152
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:43,655
Will she shoot or will she not?

153
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:44,999
What do you think?

154
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:52,457
She's here.

155
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,913
Alice.

156
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:10,199
Alice!

157
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:27,191
 But the reality before my very eyes

158
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:29,927
 prevented me from feeling that calm.

159
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:39,304
She must finally be ready.

160
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,940
Gyeo Wool...

161
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,670
Run.

162
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:10,180
Shoot if you can.

163
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,945
Gyeo Wool…

164
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,282
Shoot.

165
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,875
Shoot!

166
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,502
What is it?

167
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:22,988
Are you worried that Ban will die, too?

168
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:38,638
How long are you going to keep hesitating?

169
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:41,307
Shoot!

170
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:57,122
Gyeo Wool…

171
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,025
Shoot him.

172
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:07,157
Why won't you listen to me, you brat?

173
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:16,384
You still haven't changed, have you?

174
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,429
You won't be able to shoot me.

175
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:24,418
 "Only those who love have the will to live."

176
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:28,789
 That's what Nam Woo Ajusshi said.

177
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:35,830
 Mr. Ban!

178
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,709
 Mr. Ban...

179
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:41,836
 Or maybe I heard wrong.

180
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:45,873
 Was it, "Sacrifice yourself for those you love"?

181
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:09,705
 Or maybe it wasn't.

182
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:19,240
 How much should one love to survive in this world?

183
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:59,338
I knew you could shoot.

184
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:06,621
You're capable of killing.

185
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,929
Die, you sick bastard.

186
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:15,481
You idiot.

187
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:20,403
Why die when you were supposed to kill me?

188
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:27,093
Because I love you.

189
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:35,434
Because I fucking love you.

190
00:30:43,727 --> 00:30:45,553
Gyeo Wool,

191
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:49,740
let's live.

192
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,019
Let's…

193
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:56,914
live.

194
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:54,605
 Mr. Ban is dead and so is Mr. Nam Woo.

195
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:56,025
 It's really just us now.

196
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:58,069
 All we have is each other.

197
00:31:58,069 --> 00:31:59,654
 We're alone in this world.

198
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:01,662
 We're fucked.

199
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:03,223
 How did our lives get this way?

200
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:06,828
 Beats me. All I wanted was to be a normal high school kid.

201
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:08,770
 - You? 
 - Why not?

202
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,730
 There's nothing special about being normal.

203
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,649
 We fight for our lives, endure and make do just like the others.

204
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:16,069
 Just like the others.

205
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,755
  Just hearing it sounds difficult.

206
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:19,757
 Count me out. What a bore.

207
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:21,651
 But it's the easiest option.

208
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:25,127
 I doubt it'll be boring, though, since we'll still be hunted.

209
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:27,088
 We really are fucked.

210
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:31,141
 How can you sleep right now?

211
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:32,727
 I'm tired.

212
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:35,580
 Weirdly, I'm sleepy and cold.

213
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,415
 It's even snowing right now.

214
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:40,676
 No, it's not. Those are cherry blossom petals.

215
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,442
 No way. It's snow.

216
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:49,969
 You're right.

217
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,373
 Snow already? Could the CSAT be over?

218
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:53,724
 I doubt it.

219
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:55,543
 It must be because my name means "winter."

220
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:57,753
 You're right. When I first saw you,

221
00:32:57,753 --> 00:33:00,963
 I thought you were ice. A very pretty ice.

222
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:02,657
 Why is your name Gyeo Wool?

223
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,510
 It's the name of Mr. Ban's daughter.

224
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,795
 She was to remain cold to survive in this brutal world.

225
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:10,122
 Why is your name Yeo Reum?

226
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,975
 So that I'd live passionately.

227
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:15,403
 Mr. Nam Woo wanted me to live passionately.

228
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:20,108
 But where are we headed right now?

229
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:22,904
 I don't know, but we should run away.

230
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:26,230
 Sure. Let's run away.

231
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,491
 We ought to do that,

232
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:31,400
 but I'm sleepy too.
