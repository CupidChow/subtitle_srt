1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:16,900

2
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,290

3
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,660

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,490

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,970

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,040

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,430

8
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:49,909

9
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,184

10
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:04,965
Does this

11
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,458
all seem like a joke to you two?

12
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,978
The joke is on you because I'm dead serious.

13
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:11,779
Get down!

14
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:27,628
Gosh.

15
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:31,082
He really won't fight back.

16
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,185
Why are you so calm though?

17
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:37,813
- Hey. At least scream. 
 - You...

18
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:39,941
You said you'd go easy on him.

19
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:41,568
This doesn't look like it.

20
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,045
Just watch.

21
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:46,973
You'll soon find out what that psycho's really like.

22
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,842
- You! 
 - This won't faze him.

23
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:51,769
Get him up.

24
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,264
I see you haven't been properly beaten up before.

25
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:57,825
That's just him withstanding the pain.

26
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,610
Shut up.

27
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,588
Are you laughing?

28
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:05,360
Keep on laughing, why don't you?

29
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:10,229
- Come on. Fight back already! 
 - Don't laugh, you shithead!

30
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,554
Right.

31
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,298
I have it figured out now.

32
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,000
Thanks.

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,853
What are you saying?

34
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:29,157
Go on.

35
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,231
Hey, Han Gyeo Wool,

36
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:39,935
what did you want to ask?

37
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:42,897
Are you insane? This isn't the time for that.

38
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,464
Hey, Asshole!

39
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,902
This right here is why you piss me off.

40
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:51,030
Who do you think you are? A hero?

41
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,706
Why do you keep acting like you're better than us?

42
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,866
Sorry.

43
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:59,263
You know, I've been meaning to ask for some time now.

44
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,557
- Why do you bully others? 
 - What?

45
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,874
I like getting beat up.

46
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:07,003
Does hitting people do it for you? Is that why?

47
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,331
Do you think we bully kids for a specific reason?

48
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:11,484
We're just annoyed, that's all.

49
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:13,050
Right?

50
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:15,261
I knew it.

51
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,055
Your laughter pisses me off the most.

52
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:20,493
A pacifist hero? A school without bullies?

53
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,286
It's all bullshit.

54
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,789
Why do you think I brought them all here, you annoying shit?

55
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,881
Anyway,

56
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:31,462
just like last time, it'll be over only when someone admits defeat.

57
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,072
Bring it on, you shithead.

58
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:35,356
And promise me...

59
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,140
that you won't harm Gyeo Wool.

60
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:42,582
- What? 
 - Whatever.

61
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:45,616
I'm dropping out of school anyway to work at my new job.

62
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:06,445
Today, I'm going out with a bang.

63
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,450
♫  Stay with me  ♫

64
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,550
♫  I'm lonely when you leave me  ♫

65
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,910
♫  Ever since I saw you  ♫

66
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,180
♫  I can't stop thinking about you  ♫

67
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,430
♫  I just want to say  ♫

68
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,160
♫  Hold me tight  ♫

69
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:05,130
♫  I'm lonely when you leave me  ♫

70
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,360
♫  Ever since I saw you  ♫

71
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,620
♫   I can't stop thinking about you   ♫

72
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,160
♫   I just want to say I love you   ♫

73
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,440
♫   Never leave me alone   ♫

74
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:01,780
♫   Love me more. I need you  ♫

75
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,550
♫   It's your love, ever since I saw you   ♫

76
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,180
♫   I can't stop thinking about you   ♫

77
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,700
♫   I just want to say I love you  ♫

78
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:43,919
What the hell?

79
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:47,615
Are you kidding me?

80
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,919
Being a high schooler in Korea is so fucking hard.

81
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:57,158
Hey, what am I supposed to wait for?

82
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,319
I'll tell you later.

83
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,280
It's embarrassing, you see.

84
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,432
What is it, you moron?

85
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:07,610
Later, you moron.

86
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,914
Hey,

87
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,895
what exactly have you figured out?

88
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,603
What?

89
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,114
Oh, that.

90
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:21,015
It's thanks to you.

91
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:28,856
Thanks to you, I found a reason to live.

92
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,500
You crazy sickos.

93
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,144
What is all this?

94
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:52,671
What do you think you're doing?

95
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,060
I once asked

96
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,815
if you could handle me.

97
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,400
"Handle you"?

98
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,901
You're the one who'll have something to handle.

99
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,521
Guys, strip her down.

100
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,891
What? Are you serious?

101
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,392
I thought you were kidding–

102
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:12,918
Get over here.

103
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:15,628
Strip her down, you little shits!

104
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:22,184
You see me as a skank so let me make you one too.

105
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:26,006
I'll ruin you. Your life will be over.

106
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,083
- What are you doing? 
 - I'm taking your photo.

107
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:32,350
You'll sell for a steep price with that sweet body of yours.

108
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:52,131
Do you still think I have a sweet body?

109
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,192
Wait...

110
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:57,261
I just...

111
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,676
Han Gyeo Wool!

112
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,352
Where do you think you're going?

113
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,624
 You...

114
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,612
 were actually going to kill her, weren't you?

115
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,220
 Of course.

116
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,656
 Killing people is what I do.

117
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,309
 But...

118
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,552
 why are you so heavy?

119
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,285
Hello?

120
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:08,916
Someone fell off the rooftop.

121
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:43,728
Are you awake?

122
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:45,445
What's up with you?

123
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,757
Your buttons were undone, so–

124
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,258
I mean,

125
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:51,492
who are you?

126
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:52,860
What?

127
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,438
I'm Yeo Reum.

128
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,156
Seo Yeo Reum.

129
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:04,647
Then who am I?

130
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,162

131
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:15,157
Why this case from two years back? Does something seem strange to you?

132
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:18,037
Have you seen a case like this within the past five years?

133
00:11:18,037 --> 00:11:19,271
It was a weird one.

134
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:21,833
There were five victims, but we were told to close the case.

135
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,668
They're not innocent victims, though.

136
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:26,736
But that's how the case was concluded.

137
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,273
How many bullets do you think were fired this day?

138
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,625
Could there really have been only one shooter?

139
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,177
One who fired a gun like a lunatic?

140
00:11:33,177 --> 00:11:35,721
What I'm saying is that they're innocent victims,

141
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:39,699
even though it seems like they could've also shot back.

142
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,085
They're not gangsters and their identities check out.

143
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,087
What now?

144
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:47,850
Pharmacist, officer worker, and an elementary school teacher.

145
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,860
Yes, they check out.

146
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,237
They have no connections or a rap sheet for that matter.

147
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:56,549
However, they're all not from this part of town, which is odd.

148
00:11:57,893 --> 00:12:02,087
Let's say they're connected. Who do you suspect?

149
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:06,335
The goods we collected today make me wonder about this one guy.

150
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:08,278

151
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,789
 We checked all the cars that were in the area.

152
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:15,710
 One of them was reported stolen, so we followed up.

153
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,628
I'm afraid we're closed.

154
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:28,322
 Something about him didn't seem right.

155
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:31,225
Nothing seemed fishy at all.

156
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,204
Maybe he was actually clean.

157
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:37,492
Shit. That's what had me suspicious.

158
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,576
Why did nothing seem fishy to me?

159
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:41,353
You did all that you could back then.

160
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:43,414
First, you said it was a hit

161
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:47,091
and went on to claim an import of firearms through used cars.

162
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,819
It had the boss screaming at me too.

163
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,548
A delay in search warrants bought them enough time.

164
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:54,257
Not this again.

165
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,113
Yes?

166
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:16,923
What? How could you run and leave the guns behind, you assholes?

167
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:20,132
Get back here this instant, you–

168
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:22,577
Hello?

169
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:26,289
Hello?

170
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:36,407
Yang Yang.

171
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:41,212
Have the boys bring Seung Yeop in.

172
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,460
Can you look this way? Which school do you attend?

173
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,297
What's your name?

174
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,303
Do you know the boy beside you?

175
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,130
How can I contact your parents?

176
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,617
 Where will you go, Alice?

177
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:02,934
 Shoot your way out.

178
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,777
 Shoot me!

179
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,122

180
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,697

181
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:10,917
For accurate results, we'll have to schedule another test.

182
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,471
It seems like temporary memory loss, which usually goes away.

183
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:17,956
We couldn't find your parents' contact information, so we called the police–

184
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,201
I bet there was a fight.

185
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:22,471
I told you to ask them that later.

186
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:23,723
Don't mind him.

187
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:26,058
He's just a trashy reporter who lurks around the ER.

188
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:27,743
All he wants is a story.

189
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:28,960
Seriously?

190
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,064
I only need a few minutes, so let me talk to them first.

191
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,734
Kids, I'm not a trashy reporter,

192
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,319
so just relax and tell me what happened–

193
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,511
Yes, there was a fight.

194
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,613
Right?

195
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,505
But we're the bullies.

196
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,174
It's true.

197
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,503
There's no story here, so get lost.

198
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:50,208
They fell from a rooftop but were unscathed.

199
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,043
Questioning minors without parental consent?

200
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,669
It's for the local paper.

201
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:57,380
All I need is to take a photo.

202
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,906
Gyeo Wool.

203
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:05,223
Before we do anything else, let me take a photo. That's okay, right?

204
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:07,533
We'll leave the police to deal with the bullying.

205
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,685
Surviving that drop is close to a miracle.

206
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:11,321
 Get up.

207
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:14,680
- Here we go. 
 -  Where will you go, Alice?

208
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:18,384
- One. 
 -  Come on!

209
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,986
 Alice, run!

210
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,229
- Two. 
 -  Alice!

211
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,768
I'll die if I get caught. I must hide.

212
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:29,645
I'll die if I get caught. I must hide.

213
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,659
My mind is blank.

214
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,213
I don't remember anything.

215
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:40,272
Gyeo Wool, calm down.

216
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,867
Who are you?

217
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:44,593
Why the hell are you by my side?

218
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,237
We're dating.

219
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,948
I'm your boyfriend.

220
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,458
What?

221
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:59,650
I'm Yeo Reum and you're Gyeo Wool. 
  (T/N: Yeo Reum and Gyeo Wool, summer and winter respectively.)

222
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,278
We're the golden couple.

223
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:04,346
A match made in heaven.

224
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,445
That's fucking corny.

225
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,847
What the hell?

226
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,878
Are you two shooting a movie?

227
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:52,077
Did you two fight and end up falling off the rooftop?

228
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,539
Did she win the fight against you?

229
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:57,642
It just doesn't make any sense. Are you kidding me?

230
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,796
I know my heyday was decades in the past,

231
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:04,505
but you know who I am. I won the silver medal in Sydney in 2000.

232
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:06,651
People called me the Flying Bee.

233
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,889
You know how good I am.

234
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:13,434
But if you put your mind to it, you can easily beat me.

235
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:16,185
Aren't I right?

236
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:21,056
Hey, Seo Yeo Reum!

237
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,426
It sounds to me like you're bragging.

238
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:24,946
Jeez.

239
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:27,730
Anyway, who called the ambulance?

240
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,607
Who did you get beaten up by?

241
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:32,768
Gyeo Wool.

242
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,039
I understand you were injured,

243
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,807
but if you remember anything...

244
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,031
 Run!

245
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,385
 There can't be photos or videos of you like before.

246
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:49,987
 Don't make any friends since they won't last.

247
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:53,860
 Come. Let's get out of here.

248
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,443
Don't you remember anything?

249
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,478
Right.

250
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,290
We're friends, right? Did we get along?

251
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,157
Yes.

252
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:07,745
Of course, we're good friends. Best friends!

253
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,640
Do you have a death wish?

254
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,085
Don't leave from under your covers.

255
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:18,431
That's easy.

256
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,260

257
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,072
What's this?

258
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:03,103

259
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:13,170
What's this?

260
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,340
Why did an article about me pop up?

261
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,325
Well...

262
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:21,055
I wanted to know more about you,

263
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:24,607
so I had your name on auto-search for posts.

264
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:28,319
Is that so?

265
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,924
Unlock it for me.

266
00:20:34,743 --> 00:20:36,620

267
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,915

268
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,377

269
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,924

270
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:53,085
That was fast.

271
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:02,403
Bingo.

272
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,033
Bingo.

273
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,360
Hi, Alice.

274
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,205
She was in school.

275
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,699
Call it in.

276
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:58,510
 I'll die if I get caught. I must hide.

277
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,178
What are you up to?

278
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:10,997
What is it?

279
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:14,301
I need to step out for a while.

280
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:16,744
Why? What's this about?

281
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:20,756
It's because I'm scared.

282
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:24,135
Anyway, I might be gone for a while.

283
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,647
I almost wet myself.

284
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:42,829
Is she gone?

285
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,382
Shit.

286
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:50,462
I get that you don't care about school,

287
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:53,214
but you'll be back before the CSAT, right?

288
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:54,741
I don't know.

289
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,468
I'll get going then.

290
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,176
Hey, Yeo Reum.

291
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:08,738
We're friends, aren't we?

292
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:18,013
You're why I made it this far.

293
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:28,858
You moron. Why would you ask him that?

294
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:33,054
It's just that I feel like I won't get to see him again.

295
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:07,179
- What the hell? 
 - What the hell?

296
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,634
It's too late at night for a student to be out.

297
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:12,687
You must be kidding me. Then what about you?

298
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:15,846
I was headed to the teacher's office.

299
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,254
- Why? 
 - To find your student record.

300
00:24:21,254 --> 00:24:25,330
- What for? 
 - There must be a way to contact your parents.

301
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,949
What about you?

302
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:29,977
Me, too.

303
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:31,762
Do you have a key?

304
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:38,087
- Hand them over. 
 - No.

305
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:41,822
- Shit. 
 - It's about that article, isn't it?

306
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,833
Where will you run off to?

307
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,569
- I don't know. 
 - Who's after you?

308
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:49,113
- I don't know that either. 
 - Then what should I do?

309
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,625
What's it to you whether I run off or not?

310
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:55,937
Should I really not give a damn?

311
00:24:55,937 --> 00:24:58,747
I was in that article, too.

312
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,777
Whoever's looking for you will come after me, too,

313
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:04,203
so we're better off sticking together.

314
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,222
That's my conclusion.

315
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:07,698
Also,

316
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:10,392
I...

317
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:12,570
- like– 
 - Don't.

318
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:16,824
- Don't say it. 
 - Anyway.

319
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:20,328
Should I not give a damn?

320
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,876
No, give a damn.

321
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:30,696
I want you to give a damn.

322
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,167
Deal.

323
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:01,002

324
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:08,343

325
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,353

326
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:19,860
What the hell?

327
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:22,290
This isn't you.

328
00:26:24,526 --> 00:26:26,335
She's prettier.

329
00:26:44,713 --> 00:26:47,550
 The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

330
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,726
 Please leave a message after the beep.

331
00:26:53,471 --> 00:26:55,256
What the hell?

332
00:26:58,468 --> 00:27:00,119
Is it the security guard?

333
00:27:01,296 --> 00:27:02,697
No.

334
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:26,212
Hide.

335
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:54,156
What's going on?

336
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:55,785
- I can't see. 
 - You can't see?

337
00:27:55,785 --> 00:27:57,168
No.

338
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:15,370
I really can't be bothered.

339
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,441
Damn.

340
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,376
Who was that?

341
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:49,045
Hey, Yeo Reum!

342
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:55,651
Damn it.

343
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:08,898
Seo Yeo Reum?

344
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:23,946
Hello, Mr. Tak.

345
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:27,618
Why are you here at this hour?

346
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:29,110
No reason.

347
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,715
I could ask you the same thing, though.

348
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:37,194
What's unusual about a teacher being in the teacher's office?

349
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:38,886
Well...

350
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:41,639
I guess you're right.

351
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,345
Where are you going? Come closer.

352
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:48,706
I don't bite, you know.

353
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:50,948
Sorry? Oh, right.

354
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:58,756
Unbelievable.

355
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:06,989
Are you here alone?

356
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:10,067
Yes.

357
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:12,620
I see.

358
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:12,140

359
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,799
Seriously.

360
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,410
Have you really forgotten everything?

361
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:31,098
I hear you brought down the school and almost killed the principal.

362
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,034
Was that a lie?

363
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:40,433
Alice, get a hold of yourself.

364
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:47,131
Where's the list?

365
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:52,087

366
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:56,607
 This must be my world, Yeo Reum.

367
00:31:58,735 --> 00:31:59,945
 And you call yourself a teacher?

368
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:03,313
 I'll end you both right here.

369
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:06,025
 You're the first person to give me a reason to live.

370
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,869
 Promise me.

371
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:11,580
 Promise that you won't kill anyone.

372
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,391
 Gyeo Wool, run!

373
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:20,539
 Do you still like me knowing all this?
