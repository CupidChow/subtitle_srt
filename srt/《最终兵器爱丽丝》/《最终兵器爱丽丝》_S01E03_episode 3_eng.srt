1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:17,500

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,340

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,670

4
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,540

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,980

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,060

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,430

8
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:49,909

9
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,184

10
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,114
Hello?

11
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,326
I was just wondering...

12
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,714
Wait. Stop!

13
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,961
What is this? You said that all you wanted was a beating.

14
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:26,963
- Right. 
 - Then why does it seem

15
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:29,174
like you suddenly want to attack me? It's scary.

16
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:32,301
I may prefer to be hit,

17
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:36,070
but I can throw a punch too. Besides, you're the exception.

18
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,782
What?

19
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,911
Why am I an exception?

20
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,253
Because you keep denying it.

21
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:44,088
- Deny what? 
 - I thought about it a lot.

22
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,376
Our fight.

23
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,772
You see,

24
00:02:53,615 --> 00:02:55,909
I'm just a regular high schooler.

25
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,254
A girl, I might add. One that's studious. I don't know how to fight.

26
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,982
No. You're really strong.

27
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,766
I'm not.

28
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,419
Step back.

29
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,502
Then why did you follow me up here?

30
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:15,971
I never forced you to.

31
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:17,755
Well...

32
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:26,882
I'm only here to talk to you.

33
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:29,276
Trouble is the last thing I'm asking for.

34
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,695
You're at the top of the pyramid at school, and I'm the new student.

35
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:34,614
What if the others started a weird rumor?

36
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,524
That would be the worst.

37
00:03:36,524 --> 00:03:39,244
All I want is to graduate without any trouble.

38
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:41,462
It's why I'm here. To talk.

39
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:44,907
I see. Talking is good and all,

40
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,961
but can't we fight, just once?

41
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,879
No, please step back!

42
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,381
- I know it was you. 
 - Don't cut me off.

43
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:02,535
Okay, fine. Let's say that it was me.

44
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,585
What's it to you anyway?

45
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:07,038
I don't get it.

46
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,642
Just consider me as one of those people.

47
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:19,700
Can't you turn a blind eye to this once?

48
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,636
I can't.

49
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:26,357
You might've heard,

50
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:29,185
but sleeping has always been a challenge for me.

51
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,713
But I've been sleeping like a baby these days.

52
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:35,091
Your skin seems to be proof of that. It's as smooth as a baby's.

53
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:38,452
I only sleep better because... It's like I said.

54
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:39,829
It's because I think of you a lot.

55
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:42,214
You think about me?

56
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:44,700
And that puts you to sleep?

57
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,877
Are you a pervert?

58
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:48,189
Why think about me in your sleep? It's disgusting.

59
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,264
I don't know, either.

60
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:51,776
What about you?

61
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:54,602
Why do you appear in my dreams without permission?

62
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:58,205
Besides, when I think about you...

63
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:11,702
Anyway,

64
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,556
I need to see the side of you you're hiding.

65
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:19,635
I'm curious as to why you put me to sleep.

66
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,676
You didn't sleep that night. You were passed out.

67
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,665
So you admit it, do you?

68
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,101
Yes, it was me.

69
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:05,006
Good job, guys. Someone bring me Seo Yeo Reum.

70
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,039
Finally, it's over.

71
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,974
Seo Yeo Reum.

72
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,001
Enjoying your senior year, are you?

73
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:21,022
I don't envy him at all.

74
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,263
Check your texts.

75
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:33,627

76
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,196
We're screwed.

77
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:20,407
We skipped two classes, and now it's lunch break.

78
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,516
The door has been locked.

79
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,235
Really?

80
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:28,498
Is that all you can say? The other students saw us come up here,

81
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,242
and two hours have passed.

82
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,593
Is the door locked?

83
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,037
Why didn't you yell for help?

84
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,464
I guess I should callâ€“

85
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:38,207
Don't.

86
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:41,469
I'm getting out of here quietly.

87
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,608
Would it seem odd?

88
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:48,977
To go back down during lunch break.

89
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:51,670
Of course.

90
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:58,202
How stupid can I be? Why the hell did I follow you here?

91
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:03,040
Head back down first.

92
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,935
How can I just go?

93
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:11,015
You seemed serious when you came at me.

94
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:12,392
Because I was.

95
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,728
What if you landed one on me?

96
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,089
Your punches were faster than those of an average high schooler.

97
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,449
You didn't even give me a breather.

98
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,794
I couldn't find a weak spot.

99
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:33,045
No weak spots? Hey, Gyeo Wool.

100
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:36,924
Aren't I the one who's injured here?

101
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,414
Whatever. Don't laugh.

102
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,542
Stop laughing.

103
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,342
I knew I had no chance.

104
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:56,652
Why do you let people hit you?

105
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:00,398
Because pain eliminates pain.

106
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:02,058
What?

107
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:04,969
It erases any suicidal thoughts.

108
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,750
I'm just saying.

109
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,153
Where did you learn how to fight?

110
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,168
Don't be curious.

111
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:23,938
Where I learned how to fight is none of your business.

112
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,427
Wait.

113
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,728
I can't hear anything.

114
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:14,764
I thought they were up here.

115
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:16,124
She can't hear anything.

116
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:18,376
She can't hear anything, guys.

117
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:21,555
- What? 
 - Whose idea was this?

118
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,506
- Forget it. 
 - Unbelievable.

119
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,716
I'm dying to know.

120
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:25,909
Is someone getting the key?

121
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,361
Are you sure they fought?

122
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,489
He probably asked her out.

123
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:31,515
Seo Yeo Reum? No way.

124
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:33,701
Why not? He dated Jang Mi before.

125
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,352
Things aren't over between us, you know.

126
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,669
Han Gyeo Wool used to be a bully at her old school.

127
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,630
Yeo Reum asked her up here to challenge her.

128
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,807
- What? 
 - No way.

129
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:52,034
It's true, you freaks.

130
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:54,704
Right, Jin Ju? You found the video.

131
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:57,356
Yes, probably.

132
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,731
I don't want to believe it, either, but what if it's true?

133
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,691
It'll ruin the good dynamic we have at our school.

134
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:09,744
It'll only get in the way of our studying.

135
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,248
So let's check for ourselves.

136
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:14,932
If it's true,

137
00:11:14,932 --> 00:11:18,061
we can use this to force her out of school.

138
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,645
Right?

139
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:22,792
Hurry this way.

140
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,084
- Why? 
 - Hurry!

141
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,678
There's a whole crowd back there.

142
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:30,174
What now? How do we get off this roof?

143
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:32,425
They're calling you a bully.

144
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,544
- What? 
 - They know we fought.

145
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:38,656
Damn it.

146
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,060
There's no need to overreact.

147
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,771
We'll just say it isn't true.

148
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:48,317
Look at our clothes. Anyone can tell we fought.

149
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:50,802
Besides, do you think they'd actually believe us?

150
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,780
No way.

151
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,630
We seem fine.

152
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:57,967
I guess you're right.

153
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,690
You guess I'm right?

154
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,131
I'm right? Is that all you can say?

155
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:07,569
Are you going to take responsibility if I'm forced to transfer schools?

156
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:09,979
Why would you transfer schools over this?

157
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:17,320
Forget it.

158
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,572
So what's your plan?

159
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,508
Why do I need a plan?

160
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,587
They are just curious, that's all.

161
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:28,489
- It's fine. 
 - But I'm not fine.

162
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:41,819
How is it that you don't care at all about other people's situations?

163
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,648
Did feeling sorry for yourself turn you into a selfish brat?

164
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:48,092
Pain eliminates pain, and that's why you let others beat you up?

165
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,897
Living a cushy and peaceful life must've done a number on you.

166
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,420
Hey, Han Gyeo Woolâ€“

167
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,130
Do you know the meaning of pain? You'll never know what it is.

168
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,100
I have lived in a totally different world you could never imagine.

169
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,270
You know what they did to little children? And do you know what I did to run away from that?

170
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,690
I'm risking my life just trying to live a normal life here.

171
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,890
This is the last time I can live like this, so don't ever

172
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,220
act like a kid.

173
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,080
Just be thankful for what you have.

174
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,573
There's nothing to be thankful for.

175
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,686
Besides, it's all about not getting caught.

176
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,195
Wait.

177
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,259
Did you understand all that?

178
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,244
You talked fast,

179
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:41,588
so only a little.

180
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:44,223
I see.

181
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:48,652
My best grades are in English.

182
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:50,496
Oh...

183
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,487
Hey, Seo Yeo Reum.

184
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,856
Where are you going?

185
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,968
What are you doing?

186
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,875
Hurry up.

187
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,612
The kids will be here any second.

188
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,763
What?

189
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,598
It's easy to steal the keys to our school.

190
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,466
You wanted a plan,

191
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,777
so let's climb down this.

192
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:33,138
- What? 
 - All we have to do is get down.

193
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,333
You're athletic, aren't you?

194
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,834
Who lied?

195
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,836
I can't believe I wasted my lunch break on this.

196
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,129
Why do you always make a fuss?

197
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:59,106
- Unbelievable. 
 - I knew it.

198
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,840
So you are athletic.

199
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,992
Of course.

200
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,370
Let's walk in separately.

201
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,855
Let's say you were at the nurse's office, and I cut class.

202
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:32,374
- Deal. 
 - I won't bother you anymore.

203
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:34,209
Deal.

204
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:36,519
You won't get involved with me again.

205
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,521
I won't even talk to you.

206
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,568
- Deal. 
 - As if you don't exist.

207
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,277
Forever.

208
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,536
Deal!

209
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,930
 Hello, Mr. Ban!

210
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,194
I was going to call you, you know.

211
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:43,600
 Hello? Can you hear me?

212
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,020
Hello?

213
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,330
 Heâ€“ Mr. Banâ€“

214
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,550
Hello?

215
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,460
 Mr. Ban...

216
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,910
Hello?

217
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,298
 Terrible cell-service here.

218
00:16:55,298 --> 00:17:01,063
 So tell me. Did the packages arrive?

219
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,198
Yes, I'm checking them right now.

220
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:06,160
 You'll have to hurry, though.

221
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,596
 Mr. Jang's looking for her again in Korea.

222
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:10,932
What? Mr. Jang?

223
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:13,982
 Yes, and in Korea.

224
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:16,002
 Please know that I warned you.

225
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,605
Sure. You've done more than enough.

226
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:20,233
 I still think that plan of yours is absurd.

227
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:23,611
 Luring all the killers into one location

228
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:26,062
 and wiping them all out?

229
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:31,141
 Watch your back. They're after you again.

230
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,100

231
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,020

232
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,540

233
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,000

234
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,003
Would a photo search actually work?

235
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:24,922
She could've gotten plastic surgery in those two years.

236
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:26,424
If it is was me, I would have done it immediately.

237
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:28,034
Why hasn't he texted back?

238
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:30,094
He's busy with his new job.

239
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:31,429
I think he's teaching English.

240
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:34,237
Should I call him?

241
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:35,273
Leave it.

242
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:37,810
That was fast considering how he just got back from the US.

243
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,062
You were stationed in England, right?

244
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,796
Yes, of course.

245
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:43,789
Does that school actually exist?

246
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,318
I hear the principal is Korean.

247
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:48,613
Oh, the principal? He sure is admirable.

248
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:50,615
He's from London's K-town in New Malden,

249
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:53,201
and a war broke out 20 years ago in our world.

250
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:55,077
He was smack in the middle of itâ€“

251
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:57,211
Boring.

252
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:00,732
What?

253
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:03,517
Do I bore you?

254
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:06,162
You...

255
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,174
are fucking charming.

256
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:12,042
And I did a good fucking job in hiring you.

257
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,404
Anyway.

258
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:15,640
They say she was the best that the school's ever seen.

259
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,950
She's the only one who managed to escape.

260
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,752
Are you seriously lying to me? Tell me the truth. I know you were on the rooftop.

261
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:25,024
I was humiliated because of you two!

262
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:27,967
What's it to you anyway?

263
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,320
What? Why you little...

264
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,674
What did you two do up there?

265
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:36,934
We had sex. Up on the rooftop.

266
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:37,912
It was great.

267
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:39,987
You crazy bitch.

268
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:42,422
You must've lost your mind.

269
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:45,868
Did I not tell you to behave?

270
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,065
Have you already forgotten that I have the video of you?

271
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:51,217
- That willâ€“ 
 - Release it.

272
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:53,759
- What? 
 - I said to release it.

273
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,729
Why does it seem like you won't, though?

274
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,600
One, it's too dark to properly see my face.

275
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,352
All I have to do is deny it.

276
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:05,012
Some will believe it and some won't.

277
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:08,248
Also, I only transferred schools

278
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,318
because it got tiresome.

279
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:14,262
Not because the incident put me in a tough spot.

280
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:15,557
It just got tiresome.

281
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:17,758
- Why you... 
 - Two...

282
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:20,580
Can't you tell what I'm really like?

283
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,797
Do you think you can handle it?

284
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:24,482
Don't make me laugh.

285
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:27,502
- You probably drugged those guys. 
 - Even if that were the case,

286
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:31,664
it doesn't change the fact that they sexually trafficked their friends.

287
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,626
I should've just killed them.

288
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:41,056
Is it happening at this school too?

289
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:43,310
I think I heard rumors.

290
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,403
Are you one of them?

291
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,564
Are you kidding me?

292
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,093
Watch your words,

293
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:56,080
or I'll rip your mouth out and shove it up your ass.

294
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:00,835
Got it?

295
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:45,580
 Do you know the meaning of pain? You'll never know what it is. I have lived in a totally different world...

296
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,730
"I have lived..."

297
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,350
 You can never imagine...

298
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,036
"...in a totally different world you could never imagine."

299
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,982
But my world...

300
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,701
 Hi.

301
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:50,411
Did you think of me as you slept last night too?

302
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:53,222
That sounded perverted.

303
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,517
- What gives? 
 - Hey.

304
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,301
Hey.

305
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:06,504
Hey!

306
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:32,113
Hey, Seo Yeo Reum!

307
00:24:57,522 --> 00:24:58,965

308
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:10,485

309
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:18,235

310
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:40,656
Okay, let us say hello.

311
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,523
Attention, bow.

312
00:25:47,523 --> 00:25:49,492
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

313
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:51,775
Hi, kids.

314
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:53,395

315
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:56,922
Why do you all seem lifeless today?

316
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,726
I bet you didn't do well on your mock exam.

317
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,237
The CSAT is right around the corner.

318
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:06,157
Rather than learning anything new today,

319
00:26:06,157 --> 00:26:10,110

we'll go over some of the questions from the mock exam.

320
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:13,857
Wait for what, you idiot?

321
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:18,728
What did I always say the most important thing was during class?

322
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:22,473
If solving the problem seems impossible, what could be the reason?

323
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:24,617
My rose, are you all right?

324
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:30,439
I'm going to kill that skank.

325
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:35,528
So what will it be?

326
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:38,748
What do you mean? About what?

327
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:41,544
I told you a minute ago.

328
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:43,713
Are you in or out?

329
00:26:43,713 --> 00:26:46,179
Are you sure about this?

330
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:48,401
Yes, I'm sure.

331
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:49,718
All right.

332
00:26:49,718 --> 00:26:52,889
Once I properly get rid of those sons of bitches,

333
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:55,756
you'll properly be my girl.

334
00:26:58,502 --> 00:27:00,103
Deal?

335
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,565
Shit.

336
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:04,357

337
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:11,163
Why should I wait?

338
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:14,117
What does he mean?

339
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:15,977
Seo Yeo Reum, you're so annoying.

340
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:19,130
What is this about?

341
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:21,666

342
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:50,087
Everything's good, right?

343
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,696
Right.

344
00:27:51,696 --> 00:27:52,990
Everything's fine.

345
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,440
 Good.

346
00:27:55,315 --> 00:27:57,368
What?

347
00:27:57,368 --> 00:27:59,195
Is that all?

348
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:01,565
Did something happen?

349
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:03,751
No, things are going just fine.

350
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:05,576
 Oh.

351
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:07,153
I see.

352
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:13,876
Shouldn't we speed things up? I'm close to graduating now.

353
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:16,837
 I understand what you mean.

354
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:18,573
Right.

355
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,408
 But Gyeo Wool...

356
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,820
Yes?

357
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,139
After graduating,

358
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,584
how about you just move on?

359
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:32,572
 Forget it.

360
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:34,655
I'm sure you'll make a wise decision.

361
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:37,683
Is the list in a secure place?

362
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:40,050
- Yes. 
 -  Good.

363
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:44,499
 I truly hope that you never need to use it.

364
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:45,750
What do you mean by that?

365
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,785
You'll know when the time comes.

366
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:49,029
 Mr. Banâ€“

367
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:52,957
Just know that I may not be reachable for a few days. Bye.

368
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,004
Mr. Banâ€“

369
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:23,612
What now?

370
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:25,016
Are you here for the other leg?

371
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:27,508
If so, it'd already be gone.

372
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:31,137
But we're even now.

373
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:34,332
I need a favor.

374
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:38,136
It'll cost you.

375
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:42,490
Mr. Barky. His last job was with you, right?

376
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:46,118
I'm looking for him.

377
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,212
Name your price.

378
00:29:48,212 --> 00:29:50,414
All I need to know

379
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,600
is his address.

380
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:56,854
This is because I want to live.

381
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:24,156
You reek of alcohol.

382
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:27,660
I'm sober now.

383
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:32,348
Meet me up on the rooftop.

384
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:35,826
Not again.

385
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:41,248
Did you people hide something on the roof?

386
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,566
 So this school does have thugs.

387
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:56,539
 What is this revolting yet childish act I'm seeing?

388
00:30:57,924 --> 00:30:59,975
Han Gyeo Wool, is it?

389
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:03,747
This is what you get for getting involved with Seo Yeo Reum.

390
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:06,309
 No, we're not involved in any way.

391
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:07,584
I apologize for this.

392
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:09,711
 If you're sorry, just let me leave.

393
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:11,537
Charge.

394
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,206
Bang.

395
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:17,469

396
00:31:18,995 --> 00:31:21,431
I see. Is it a big case?

397
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:24,260
Not really. I just forgot to call you.

398
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,410
 Okay.

399
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,145
 Come on. Out with it.

400
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:32,141
Well, things are slightly... No, really complicated.

401
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,962
Remember that person I mentioned?

402
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:38,581
Right, how did it go?

403
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:43,012
- I lost. 
 - You lost?

404
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:44,971
He must be some kid to knock you out.

405
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:47,231
It's not a he, but a...

406
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:51,544
Anyway, one punch knocked me out cold.

407
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:54,524
But whenever I think about her, Iâ€“

408
00:31:54,524 --> 00:31:57,401
I can't wait to hear about this kid.

409
00:31:57,401 --> 00:32:00,363
But Yeo Reum, I'm afraid I'm a little busy right now.

410
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:01,389
Got it.

411
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:03,114
All right.

412
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:22,650
Are these punks at war or something?

413
00:32:23,368 --> 00:32:26,246
The shooting case that went cold from two years ago.

414
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:27,890
Get me the files.

415
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,415
Got it.

416
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,768
You saw, right? The fact that we have your girlfriend.

417
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:57,670
Get over here while I ask nicely.

418
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,564
Her? She's not actually my girlfriend.

419
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:02,275
 Just let her go and apologize.

420
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:05,134
Or else, you'll die.

421
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:07,428
Hello?

422
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:10,289
He really must be messed up in the head.

423
00:33:18,982 --> 00:33:21,017
Seriously? Seo Yeo Reum...

424
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:24,530
Drag him over here and beat him to a pulp.

425
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,722
What's with her?

426
00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:28,159
I told you before that she's a nutcase, too.

427
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,120
He's pissing me off. He ignores me when I'm here tied up?

428
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,596
He's been ignoring me all day!

429
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:37,042
Get him on the phone so I can talk to him myself.

430
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:38,710
Can't you read the situation?

431
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,454
So what? What will you do to me?

432
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:44,258
Are you going to kill me? Is that it?

433
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:48,302
- Why you skanâ€“ 
 - Whatever.

434
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:49,496
Just call him.

435
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:52,857
You want him here, so let me help.

436
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:04,137
 Seo Yeo Reum, you hung up when you're the reason I'm here?

437
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:07,004
Can't you see I'm in trouble?

438
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,839
You can manage fine by yourself.

439
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,577
Are you insane? Of course, I can't.

440
00:34:11,577 --> 00:34:13,429
I need you, so get over here.

441
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,998
I have a lot on my plate right now. Why don't you justâ€“

442
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:19,867
Just get over here so I can ask you something.

443
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:20,861
Ask me what?

444
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:22,547
Come and find out. Hurry over.

445
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:24,672
Hang up.

446
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:26,657
Good boy.

447
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:33,573
Jang Mi, wait.

448
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,726
You did good. It's okay.

449
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:38,352
I guess we did do a good job.

450
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:02,030

451
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,190
â™«  Alone, here in the dark  â™«

452
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,770
â™«  I've been injured during this exhausting night   â™«

453
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,610
â™«  A nightmare  â™«

454
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,796
What is it...

455
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:24,150
that you need to ask?

456
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,150
â™«  Can you hold me with your voice   â™«

457
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,121
What is it? What do you need to ask?

458
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:32,615
Wait!

459
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,713
Does this all seem like a joke to you?

460
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:42,810
The jokes on you because I'll really kill you.

461
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:49,720
â™«  Over and over again. Running, escaping, approaching closer is a nightmare  â™«

462
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,620

463
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:57,349
 Something about him didn't seem right.

464
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:59,825
 Have you not thought that he might actually be clean?

465
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,269
 That's what had me suspicious.

466
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:02,704
 She won the fight against you?

467
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,689
 It just doesn't make any sense.

468
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:07,883
 We're the golden couple. A match made in heaven.

469
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,146
 Being a high schooler in Korea is so fucking hard.

470
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:13,139
 What the hell?

471
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:16,033
 What's it to you whether I run off or not?

472
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,302
 Got you.

473
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,079
 Should I not give a damn?

474
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,314
 Then who am I?

475
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:23,580
 I don't remember anything.

476
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,500
â™«  Your light on me   â™«
