1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,940

2
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,250

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,680

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,550

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,930

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,080

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,430

8
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:49,867

9
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,142

10
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,846
 Wait.

11
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:08,884
 What's wrong, Seo Yeo Reum? You're scaring me.

12
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,861
 There's no need to be scared.

13
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:13,698
 Come at me.

14
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,124
 What?

15
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,036
Let me see.

16
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:37,046
You're a pretty one, aren't you?

17
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,674
Do you have a boyfriend?

18
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:41,627
No.

19
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:43,852
I see.

20
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:46,156
There's a boy I've called dibs on.

21
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:48,049
Talk to him in any way,

22
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,142
and I'll kill you.

23
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:51,636
Right.

24
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:55,722
I'm not really interested in boys yet, anyway.

25
00:01:55,722 --> 00:02:00,061
As soon as I heard your name, I didn't like it.

26
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,297
Let's say that I got a bad feeling.

27
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:06,525
Yeo Reum and Gyeo Wool. It's as if you're meant to be.

28
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,728
Childish, much?

29
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:12,298
What are you doing over there?

30
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,125
I'm unpacking.

31
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,193
Why? Do you not want me to?

32
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:19,022
Wait. Why do you have so many of these?

33
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:23,336
Oh, those. They were gifts, but they were not working for me.

34
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:25,411
They're new. Would you like them?

35
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:31,469
I have a feeling we will be good friends.

36
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:34,680
Just now, I was just messing around.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,682
This school doesn't even have bullies.

38
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:38,141
There are "no bullies"?

39
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:41,044
They were eradicated by the school's top dog.

40
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:44,357
A pacifist hero took out all the trash.

41
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:46,733
This is the most peaceful school in the country.

42
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,944
Moms aim to get their kids in here.

43
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:51,420
The police are fond of him as well.

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,808
Even the teachers let him get away with anything.

45
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,892
Who is he?

46
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,477
Don't get curious.

47
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,054
He's the one I called dibs on.

48
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,090
I see.

49
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,784
We dated last year, but he broke it off because he had no choice.

50
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:08,496
"I haven't liked anyone before."

51
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:11,891
"I don't know what that's supposed to feel like."

52
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:16,496
Damn sexy, isn't he?

53
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,382
He only dropped you because you're crazy.

54
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:23,378
You!

55
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:24,796
I told you not to call me that.

56
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:26,490
- Watch your mouth. 
 - Let go.

57
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,158
- Let go of me. 
 - Or else?

58
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,444
- You. Just die. 
 - That hurts!

59
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,977
I'm going to the convenience store. Do you want something?

60
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,215
I was thinking of going to the convenience store.

61
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:53,458
Damn it. The convenience store.

62
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,302
Do you want something? What do you want?

63
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,538
Damn it.

64
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,290
What?

65
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,234
Excuse me

66
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:23,204
I'm going to the convenience store. Do you want anything?

67
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,377
Are you treating us because it's your first day?

68
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:29,902
No.

69
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,805
We'll split the bill.

70
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,630
I'll be back soon then.

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,468
What did you find?

72
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:46,837
What was she like?

73
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:48,855
Nothing.

74
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,441
She's not on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

75
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,309
Maybe she's a ghost?

76
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,948
Transferring schools as a senior

77
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:59,949
means she got into some serious trouble.

78
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:04,319
Hurry and find something.

79
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,083
Once I have leverage, I'll make her my lapdog.

80
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,484

81
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:13,170
"No, we'll split the bill."

82
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,899
Damn. I should've just offered to pay.

83
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:27,311

84
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:28,979

85
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,380

86
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,692

87
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:35,577

88
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:39,121
Are you serious with these texts?

89
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:41,983
I know all of that, too.

90
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:46,497
It's not like I wanted to go to school. You made me go.

91
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,273

92
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:53,195

93
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,239

94
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:07,325

95
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:11,254

96
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,218

97
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,955
What the hell was that?

98
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,931

99
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:47,433
Right. I'll pretend I didn't see that.

100
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:51,177
I'll just play it cool and stay out of other people's lives.

101
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:57,658
But right now, I'm dealing with a lot of stress.

102
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:59,469
Shouldn't I blow off some steam?

103
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:03,514
Taking it out on bad guys isn't so bad. They're clearly bad people.

104
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:06,208
Yes, of course.

105
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:13,691
Forget it. My face, I mean.

106
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,428
Gyeo Wool.

107
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,480
Han Gyeo Wool?

108
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,526
She won't answer me, either.

109
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:35,815
- Gosh. 
 - What?

110
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:38,333
- Yes? 
 - Go ahead and introduce yourself.

111
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,743
Oh, of course.

112
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,860
Hi, everyone, I am Gyeo Wool Han. I was born in England.

113
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,560
But...

114
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,523
English, is it?

115
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:57,001
Say something we can understand!

116
00:07:57,001 --> 00:08:00,446
Refreshing, isn't it? It's as if she's challenging you.

117
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,723
Take a seat in the back.

118
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,806
 I'm fucked. And it's all because of him.

119
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:11,841
 Is she smiling? It doesn't suit her.

120
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,476
 Maybe it isn't her.

121
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:16,354
 Stop looking at me. You're making it obvious.

122
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:18,757
-  I'm sure it's her.  
 - As you all know...

123
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,300
-  Why does she seem different?  
 - ...you have...

124
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,086
-  I doubt he recognizes me.  
 - ...a mock exam this week.

125
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,803
 There's no way he remembers my face.

126
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,331
-  Am I wrong?  
 - I trust that you've all been

127
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,541
- studying hard. 
 -  Is it really not her?

128
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,535
Work hard today as always. That's all.

129
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:32,962
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

130
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,389
 Don't even think about talking to me.

131
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,883
-  If you do, I'll kill–  
 - Hey.

132
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:41,420
Yes?

133
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:43,890
You're a bully, aren't you?

134
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:49,470
 I see.

135
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,590
-  I must have saved a nutjob.  
 - Well...

136
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,626
You have to be.

137
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:58,128
Last night, I...

138
00:08:58,128 --> 00:08:59,939
What the...

139
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,291
Myeong Tae.

140
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,577
Myeong Tae, Hwang Tae, take me to the Nurse's Office.

141
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,265
Gosh.

142
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:13,085
It hurts.

143
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,126
Hurry.

144
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,407
That's the boy I mentioned. Did you meet him last night?

145
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:27,792
No. I didn't.

146
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,031
You have a weird taste in boys.

147
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,420
I'm sorry about that.

148
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,407
You're quite rude.

149
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,777
Maybe it's because you were raised abroad.

150
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:46,327
Please be careful.

151
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:47,762
And stay away from him.

152
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:50,575
Of course. I already don't like him.

153
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:53,018
I meant it. Don't get close to him.

154
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:55,044
He killed someone.

155
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,889
You won't be able to handle him.

156
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,992
Killed someone? As if.

157
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:03,353
Gosh, sorry about that.

158
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,846
Sorry.

159
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:06,673
I'm not joking.

160
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,517
That's why no one messes with him.

161
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:11,652
Why else would he have nightmares every night?

162
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:15,047
He's freaking hot.

163
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:29,895
Killed someone, my ass.

164
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,280
 I'll observe.

165
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,993
 I'll keep on watching.

166
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,791
 Her fake expressions.

167
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:54,045
 They don't suit her.

168
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,896
 It's awkward.

169
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:03,846
 Seriously? This is so annoying.

170
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:08,624
 I miss the girl from the alley.

171
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:11,279
 But...

172
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,842
 why am I so sleepy?

173
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,971
Crazy.

174
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,040
He's been sleeping from 9 to 6 the entire week.

175
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,301
He's like a newborn baby.

176
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,879
He scares me.

177
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,206
He's been way too normal lately.

178
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:54,697
 Yes.

179
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:56,507
 That's the expression.

180
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:01,762
 The brutal look on her face as she tackles the exam.

181
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,027
 That's her true face.

182
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:21,107
- You should be taking your exam. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

183
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,861
If you have something to tell me, say it.

184
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:35,913
You're making me uncomfortable while I'm taking the test.

185
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,176

186
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,495
Right now?

187
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:01,722
During the exam?

188
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:17,597

189
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,705

190
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,312

191
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,730

192
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:41,780

193
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,694

194
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,996

195
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:21,419
Give me a smoke.

196
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:22,870
We don't have any.

197
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,073
- Why not? 
 - We're out of money.

198
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,417
- We can't take them now. 
 - Seriously.

199
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,044
Your uncle won't even give us snacks anymore.

200
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:32,314
Why doesn't the Oseong Gang even have enough money to buy cigarettes?

201
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:35,224
- If you hadn't lost to– 
 - Enough!

202
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:38,345
I was worn out after taking the finals!

203
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,946
As if.

204
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,058
Seo Yeo Reum, you prick.

205
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:47,945
Just wait and see. You'll be done for.

206
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,056
The gang I'm trying to join.

207
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,350
They're throwing shade at me for not being able to deal with a high schooler.

208
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,561
So annoying!

209
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,355
Hello, my rose.

210
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,202
Just soju with no snacks?

211
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:07,464
My sweet rose. What has you in a bad mood? Tell me.

212
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:10,701
Yeo Reum is interested in Han Gyeo Wool.

213
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,030
Wait, hold on. You must be crazy. You're my girlfriend.

214
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,568
You're just a side piece.

215
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,094
Take him on if you don't like it.

216
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:23,380
If not, just be grateful that I'm even here.

217
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,793
That little skank. How did she manage to get his attention?

218
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,863
Shit. Is he even messing with my girlfriend now?

219
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:34,249
I found something.

220
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:35,645
What?

221
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:38,096
No way. This is huge.

222
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:40,066
She messed up big time.

223
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,308
What is it?

224
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:45,586
What is that?

225
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:46,913
- What the hell? 
 - What?

226
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,331
Wait, that...

227
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:49,833
- What? 
 - What the hell?

228
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,451
- Gosh. 
 - Jeez.

229
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,987
- What the... 
 - I heard a bone snap.

230
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,572
 I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

231
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,904
- This isn't me. 
 - Seriously?

232
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:44,630
You didn't even bat an eye.

233
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,389
I looked into it.

234
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:48,576
This is why you've been jumping from school to school.

235
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,703
You transferred twice since this incident.

236
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,788
Are you on a national tour or something?

237
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:54,624
This school has no bullies.

238
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:57,783
Even if you deny it, you'll be transferred out of here

239
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,212
if word gets out.

240
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:01,172
- It isn't me. 
 - Anyway,

241
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:03,615
don't talk to Yeo Reum.

242
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:05,533
Just keep to yourself.

243
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,710
That's what you want, too, isn't it?

244
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,698
That's easy.

245
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,092
Is that all?

246
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:15,761
No, there's more.

247
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,804
Gosh, I'm starving.

248
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,323
You are, too, right?

249
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,651
What's wrong? It's not like you to call.

250
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:50,137
Must I have a reason to call you? I could just–

251
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,348
 I'll send you money, so do as the students say.

252
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:54,065
 Don't cause trouble like before.

253
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:55,684
Why though?

254
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:57,419
You have to be careful.

255
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,213
There can't be photos or videos of you like before.

256
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,767
Don't make any friends, since you won't be able to see them for long anyway.

257
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:05,526
 Ignore them and put up with them.

258
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,131
Why don't I just quit school altogether?

259
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,092
 We'll move up our plan. Why bother to wait?

260
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,660
Should we?

261
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,755
Do you want to quit today?

262
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:20,084
But you like being in school. Are you sure?

263
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:21,294
Me?

264
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:23,629
No way. Being in school is super annoying.

265
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:26,215
 You actually have time to be annoyed?

266
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:29,427
Yes. Bring them on right now. I'm ready, you know.

267
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,544
And I don't care if I die.

268
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:37,624
- Alice. 
 - Don't call me that!

269
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:39,868
Come.

270
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,279
 Let's get out of here.

271
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:48,652
 Give me a second.

272
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:50,896
 I need to get something first.

273
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:29,904
 A list of assassins who are active all over the world.

274
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:32,614
 It contains the identities of the Company's agents,

275
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,640
 their plans, targets,

276
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,052
 and information on the children they trained.

277
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:43,674
 My goal is to expose this list to get revenge on the Company.

278
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,648
 No wonder they're after this.

279
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,311
 Are you insane?

280
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:05,888
 Did you bring this knowing what it was?

281
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:07,333
 The whole world will see it.

282
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,509
 You'll die. There's no doubt about it.

283
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,138
 It's not just you. Everyone involved will also die.

284
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:14,189
 - I don't care. 
 - Why not?

285
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:16,892
 Then I could take down the bastards who did this to me!

286
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:17,876
 - You can't. 
 - I can.

287
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:21,504
 What can you do? There's nothing you can do!

288
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:33,841
 Let's stay alive for now.

289
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:37,570
 Is that all you can say even though your daughter's dead?

290
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,922
 Gyeo Wool died!

291
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,898
 Are you serious about getting revenge?

292
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:03,362
 Your dream was to be in school like other kids your age.

293
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:12,380
 I'll make them think we left the country,

294
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,860
 so that we can't be tracked.

295
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:17,885
 It will seem as if we're constantly on the move.

296
00:21:21,831 --> 00:21:24,258
 Until the time is right,

297
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:26,944
 you'll go to school here.

298
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,752
 I didn't actually mean it, you know.

299
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:38,230
 We can keep your identity hidden.

300
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,537
 What do you want to do then?

301
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:48,708
 Go to school for the time being while I prepare things on my end.

302
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,162
 Then you can decide if you want revenge or–

303
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:53,621
 Live a normal life?

304
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:57,767
 Is that even possible for me?

305
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:01,495
 There's a place where people like us live.

306
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:03,339
 I don't know the location,

307
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,174
 but we can search for it.

308
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:09,713
 Hide the list someplace only you would know.

309
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:11,639
 Keep it from me, too.

310
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:15,701
 Why are you going this far for me?

311
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,584

312
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,530

313
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:04,751
You idiot! What did you do?

314
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,552
Mom...

315
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:10,239
She dies over and over again.

316
00:23:21,284 --> 00:23:23,386
I hear you've been going around getting beaten up.

317
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:27,114
Let me hit you instead.

318
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:30,192
I'll teach you

319
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,929
how to withstand punches.

320
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,991
That's it.

321
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:04,919
Keep your guard up.

322
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:10,007
Keep your guard up, Yeo Reum.

323
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:15,371
If you want to live,

324
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,390
keep your guard up!

325
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:30,778
That hurts.

326
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:34,699
What was that, you prick?

327
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:39,821

328
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:42,616
Have you not been having suicidal thoughts lately?

329
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:45,359
Have you been sleeping well? Any nightmares?

330
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,104
Well, I haven't really been having those either nowadays.

331
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,445
Whoever it is, befriend them.

332
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:06,014
Take them to a nice restaurant. Stick close to them.

333
00:25:06,014 --> 00:25:08,099
You know that I can't.

334
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:10,310
You have other friends. Myeong Tae and Hwang Tae.

335
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,163
They're the ones who approached me first.

336
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:15,448
You stick with them this time around.

337
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,044
Strike up conversations in your own way.

338
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:21,905
You said they throw a mean punch.

339
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:24,008
If he's good enough to take you on.

340
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:27,134
Bring him to the gym sometime.

341
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:30,080
Wait. What if that punk is really strong?

342
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,107
- I'd love to train him. 
 - It's a she,

343
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:34,501
not a he.

344
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:38,195
Be a man and get in his face!

345
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:42,217

346
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:47,347
 That's right.

347
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:50,082
 I need to see it.

348
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,595
 Han Gyeo Wool's true colors.

349
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:02,779
 You must be curious. Right now, it's gym period.

350
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:05,481
 So why are we up on the rooftop?

351
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:10,311
 Yeo Reum, why the hell am I up here with you?

352
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,863
 Isn't it obvious?

353
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,141
 You followed me up here on your own two feet.

354
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,318
 To face off with me.

355
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:22,698
 Are you that desperate to die?

356
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:27,228
 Yes, if it is by your hands, I wouldn't mind.

357
00:26:29,347 --> 00:26:30,907
Wait.

358
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:59,394
 The American ambassador stationed in England

359
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:02,039
 has gone missing along with his family.

360
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,985
 On the third, American ambassador Michael Tyler and his family

361
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:08,863
 went missing after dining out together.

362
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:13,016
 The ambassador was absent from work the next day without any notice,

363
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:17,004
 and his phone was turned off which alarmed the embassy.

364
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:20,291
 He was then reported missing to the police.

365
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:21,625
 That afternoon,

366
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,069
 England officially acknowledged the ambassador's disappearance

367
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:25,996
 and began an investigation.

368
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:29,333
 But today, the ambassador's car was found

369
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,511
 in an underground parking lot of a building in London.

370
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:33,137
-  It seemed like a lead...  
 - Stop watching.

371
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:35,139
-  ...but no traces was found.  
 - I can't.

372
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:37,099
The international situation is in turmoil.

373
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:39,142
- I must keep watching. 
 -  A source within the police

374
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:40,610
 stated that the car

375
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,731
 wasn't found in the building the ambassador frequented.

376
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:46,067
 So rather than this being a simple missing person's case,

377
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:48,176
 it seems more likely he was kidnapped

378
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:51,679
 for a monetary or political purpose–

379
00:27:52,764 --> 00:27:55,667
Yang Yang, it's today, isn't it?

380
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:59,153
Yes, make the call.

381
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,190

382
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,703
 Where's Alice?

383
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:34,547
 You couldn't find her, could you?

384
00:28:35,532 --> 00:28:39,085
No, wait. I have a lead.

385
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:41,813
Hey.

386
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:43,732
You'll hurt my feelings if you laugh like that.

387
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:45,685
I called you because I have information.

388
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:47,627
I was in Columbia two months ago.

389
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:50,214
You know I'm from Villavicencio, right?

390
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:52,967
Anyway, a shaman I know manages hired guns as I do.

391
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:54,440
He had his boys–

392
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,220
Fuck!

393
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,985
Why are you yelling? I'm not done talking.

394
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:06,455
 Hey, Jang.

395
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:07,780
Yes?

396
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:11,642
I guess we'll see each other soon.

397
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:16,323
I'll do my best, okay?

398
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:18,490
Find her for me again.

399
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,501
In Korea.

400
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:28,084
Damn bastard.

401
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:30,463
"Fuck! Fuck!" Is that all he can say?

402
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:31,755
We're not animals.

403
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:33,864
You fraud.

404
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:36,360
- What? 
 - Villavicencio.

405
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,596
You're a fraud who is all talk and no action. Why does he work with you?

406
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:42,448
I get the job done sometimes.

407
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,851
Besides, I'm the best he'll find in Korea.

408
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:46,479
Even I would choose us as a partner.

409
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,771
We do as we're told,

410
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:50,149
and we can be killed easily if anything goes wrong.

411
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,850
And no one would care if we died.

412
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,752
So you know.

413
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:02,301
Should I tell you just how insane Spicy is?

414
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,429
Curious, aren't you? I bet you're so curious you could lose your mind.

415
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,990
Spicy...

416
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,685
was born again the day she ran away.

417
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,965
As a man who lost it down south.

418
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:15,773
What do you mean?

419
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:20,636
Here.

420
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:26,686
I see. The stick?

421
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:28,652
No...

422
00:30:28,652 --> 00:30:31,054
the two brothers.

423
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:34,110
Even if it was the stick, it's enough to drive anyone nuts.

424
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,711
He's going to make it rain blood.

425
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:49,417
 He's been doing research so that when he gets his hands on Alice, rather than killing her,

426
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:53,027
 he will slice her bones and melt her skin

427
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:55,606
 while keeping her alive for as long as possible.

428
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,182
 He's completely bonkers!

429
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:05,331
You're a resilient one, aren't you?

430
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:09,118
Your wife melted rather quickly, so why won't you?

431
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,140
Why isn't he getting dissolved?

432
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:32,630
I don't think you can shoot.

433
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:35,870
Shoot and I'll let you go.

434
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,752
It's okay to not be able to shoot.

435
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:47,415
But that is not acceptable from the kids I train.

436
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:49,100
I trained Alice myself.

437
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,710
She's a natural-born assassin.

438
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,871
She isn't aware of it, but she's the perfect assassin.

439
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:59,393
If only I could show you.

440
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:05,641
Then one day, she ran away. Could she be a failed attempt?

441
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:08,627
They deserve to die if they're broken!

442
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,405
No, she's not broken.

443
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:15,968
There's no way I created a failure, right?

444
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:18,339
Little by little, piece by piece...

445
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:21,716
We promised to live together for many years.

446
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:23,884
Right, Alice?

447
00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:26,454
 He feels no pain and can't die.

448
00:32:26,454 --> 00:32:28,139
 He's taking all sorts of medication

449
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:30,192
 and spends his waking hours thinking about her.

450
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:33,035
And thus, a true maniac was born.

451
00:32:37,983 --> 00:32:39,967
Could I...

452
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:41,928
perhaps take a break?

453
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:45,231
Sure. Do what you want.

454
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:49,335
Look at his face.

455
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,672
He will kill someone today.

456
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:56,283
Why don't we go through some photos?

457
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,230

458
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:08,446
Getting a hit would be huge.

459
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,640
I can add new search terms.

460
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,034
Really? What do you recommend?

461
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:16,837
High school.

462
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:18,664
High school?

463
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:21,117
No way.

464
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:23,102
Nurse's office.

465
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:24,513
Sports field.

466
00:33:24,513 --> 00:33:25,872
Teacher's office.

467
00:33:25,872 --> 00:33:28,065
Highschooler.

468
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,868
Senior year.

469
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:38,059
- New student. 
 - New student.

470
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:38,902

471
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:57,747
What will you do once you find her?

472
00:33:57,747 --> 00:34:00,306
All I need is the list.

473
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:06,312
How much do you think it'll be worth?

474
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:17,000

475
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,418
How much?

476
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:23,229
I could give you everything you want.

477
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,851
Lower your pants, you one-minute man.

478
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:49,055

479
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:52,475
 You're the top dog, and I'm the new student.

480
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:55,245
 All I want is to graduate without any trouble.

481
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:58,222
 Can't you turn a blind eye this once?

482
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,235
 Can't you tell what I'm really like?

483
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:04,270
 Do you think you can handle it?

484
00:35:06,573 --> 00:35:07,657
 "I have lived in"

485
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:10,843
 "a totally different world you could never imagine."

486
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,664
 Don't be curious.

487
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:17,566
 I need to see the side of you that you're hiding.
