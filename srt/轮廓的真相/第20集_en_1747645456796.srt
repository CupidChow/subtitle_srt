Dad!

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Dad!

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why are you here?

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Dad has something to do.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He's going to the second uncle's house for a few days.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Together?

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No!

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Will he die?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How could he?

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I have to come back to pick you up.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You promise?

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I promise you.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll come back to pick you up as soon as possible.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Take good care of him for me.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Dad!

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mom!

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You don't know me?

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you hurt?

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't be afraid.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Someone will come to save us soon.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Trust me.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll trust you again.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Someone will come to save us.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Get down.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Go.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Go.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Take good care of him.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go.

Taoism Grandmaster

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Brother, we saw the child at the mute's house.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But Luo Haixiao never showed up.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Bring the child back.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's a good sign.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I understand.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's half past seven, Brother.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's go.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Go to pack up.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Gu Da, find out what Luo Hua is doing.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What is the reason for the child's birth?

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Apply for support immediately.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Your foot.

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
My foot.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Stop it.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Open it.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Open it.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Open it.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Open it.

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's locked.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Can't open it.

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is this the key?

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's finally locked.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Kick it.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Kick it.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Can't open it.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Run.

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Who are you?

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't move.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Stop.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Go with me.

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Go forward.

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Stop.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Come on.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The children are all here.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hurry up.

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Stop.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Stop.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Stop.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hurry up.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Stop.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Stop.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Stop.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hurry up.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Stop.

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Stop.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Stop.

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Stop.

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Be careful.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Be careful.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's okay.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Be careful.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Be careful.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Come on.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Go.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Be careful.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Come on.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Be careful.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't be afraid.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mo Mo.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's okay.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is there anyone else?

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I want to point.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Where is Zhang Gui Ping?

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Protect the children.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Go.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Go.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Go.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Go.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Go.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Go.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Go.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Go.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Go.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't move.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Come on.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why are you following me?

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Take it, Jiang Liang.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Xiaoxu.

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hurry up.

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's a bit late.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hurry up.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Are you okay?

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm fine.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So ugly.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Take off your makeup.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Director Gu.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Did you get it?

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Including Mr. Du.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
All 13 children are in the grade 9.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well done.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Director Gu.

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I heard that you found this mole.

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And you lurk here.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You give us time.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's worth praising.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you, Director Du.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Report, Director Du.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
A Lai and Zhang Gui Ping are not caught yet.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We have a plan.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hurry up.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hurry up.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Where is my sister?

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What sister?

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
A sister holding a doll.

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We will split up immediately.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Search the ground.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Go.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Go.

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hello.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What's up?

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm busy.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What's the situation?

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
My people shot me.

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yesterday in the office.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A woman and a child were taken away.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Such a big thing.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why did you call me?

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You called the police.

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Call your local police station.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why did you call me?

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Listen to me first.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have an impression of that woman.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Her name is Su Yun.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
She used to be Huang Jiang's lover.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And the one you want to find.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What?

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't answer.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Luo Hai Xiao has a relationship with her.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
A sister holding a doll.

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Send me an address.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What's up?

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
New address.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Go to Su Yun's house.

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Here.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Su Yun's house.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Brother Qi.

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Are you Su Yun?

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Go upstairs and have a look.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't look.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's okay.

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We are police.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We are here to help you.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's okay.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are Su Yun, right?

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What did she say?

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You are a child.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All the children are rescued.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thirteen.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
One is not.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Your child.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Someone took your child.

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Do you know who took it?

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Ah Lan.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Gui Yi.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you know where they are?

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Chief.

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Chief.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Save the body.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's okay.

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's okay.

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's okay.

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's okay.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Brother.

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Brother.

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Brother Lai forced me.

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You scared my daughter.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
How dare I scare her?

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Here.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And here.

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
She bit it.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's a little ancestor.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Brother.

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let me go.

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Where is Gui Yi?

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't know.

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Where is Gui Yi?

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I really don't know.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Wang He.

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Follow me.

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay.

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Brother Lai.

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The thing you want has appeared.

232
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Brother.

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Don't poke me.

234
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Here.

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No.

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I really don't know.

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It has nothing to do with me.

239
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let me go.

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll check it for you.

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Let me go.

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll check it.

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I...

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Gui Yi is there.

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Where is he?

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Taiding.

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Keyue Station.

248
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
How do you know

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I know where he is?

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
His passport is half of it.

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I should stop here

309
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
with a piece of grass

310
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Is it satisfaction

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
or another kind of progress?

312
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm going to continue

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
an endless journey

314
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Is there freedom

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
or a broken heart?

316
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I've crossed a few mountains

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and traveled a few miles

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I've just started to miss

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the way I left

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I've shed a few tears

321
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and read a few books

322
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I've just realized that happiness

323
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
can't be caught or kept
