Episode 18

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Once upon a time,

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
there was a father named Arlong.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He lived with his wife in a village.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Arlong didn't have a wife,

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but he was very poor.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Once, when he was fishing in the sea,

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
he found a charming jade pendant.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What is a jade pendant?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A jade pendant is a boss.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's very valuable.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He brought the jade pendant to Jiali.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
His wife told him

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that he shouldn't bring anything from others.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But he thought his wife was wrong.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Because he wanted to bury the jade pendant,

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and then they could live better.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Uncle Shang.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is mom back?

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Whatever.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Mom will be back soon.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Here, I'll get you a cup.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Gu Yu's ID is fake.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
His phone is also empty.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's not strange.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A person can hide for 20 years.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He can't make a mistake easily.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hello.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Dai Qian lost her son.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is the same.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Stop.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Police!

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Police!

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Help us!

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's my fault!

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll pay you back!

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Aunt!

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Get up!

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Aunt!

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Calm down.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll try to find the child.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't worry.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The child should be put in the house at once.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And Zhang Guiping will not make any request

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
in the long term.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It depends on us.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Keep all the surveillance cameras on the line.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't let any car go.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I see.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll go to the police station first.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you okay?

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you okay?

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Are you okay?

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Wei.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't touch me.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's not an accident.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's not an accident.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's okay.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's okay.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't touch my things.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll be right there.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't play tricks on me.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I said don't touch my things!

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Do you remember if you're done or not?

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What we've done is

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to check whether or not

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
there's any traces of

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the former suspect.

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The investigation we've done

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
during these days

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
can basically be confirmed

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that this is a major crime group

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
led by Zhang Guiping.

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He has been hiding

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
all kinds of identities

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
in society

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
for a long time.

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And the children he abducted

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
also became his accomplices.

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He continues to

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
kill and murder

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
the criminals.

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He called these

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
the five tigers.

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We now suspect

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
that the twelve people

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,760
is in the hands of this gang.

125
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,280
Not only that,

126
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
the case of Tang Cheng's gold theft

127
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,440
is also suspected by this gang.

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,240
Among them, Luo Hai Xiao

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,720
is an important suspect

130
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,320
who killed Yang Dong and Liu Kui.

131
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,960
Zhang Guiping, Xu Honglai,

132
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,560
and Luo Hai Xiao

133
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,880
are extremely dangerous.

134
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,720
We have got all the evidence

135
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,160
of their crimes.

136
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,560
This time,

137
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
we must save all the children

138
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,480
and punish these suspects.

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,560
Yes.

140
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,620

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,760

Show me your ID cards.

144

Your ID card and license are all ready.

145
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,240
Your ID card and license are all ready.

146
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,080
Tram after them.

147
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,720
care of front

148
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,600
Okay, stop.

149
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,800
Show me your ID cards.

150
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,440
Please open your back trunk

151
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm still in a rented car

152
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,520
It's so bad

153
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,260
I need to hospitalize

154
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,760
annoying

155
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,940
一LIang, wait, my Car

156
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,200
I'm getting tired

157
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,940
Step aside

158
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,320
Thanks

159
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,600
lish

160
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,340
WOW

161
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,640
Take a break

162
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,500
hey

163
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,100
hook

164
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,120
Thanks

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,460
No, good

166
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,200
Thank you

167
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,260
Ok

168
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,320
I'm sorry.

169
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,880
He's Zhao Zhi's ex-wife.

170
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,480
Luckily, he spilled the water today.

171
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,440
I feel better.

172
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,400
I think Zhao is a smart person.

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,640
It's the criminal who committed the crime, not you.

174
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,280
I'm sorry.

175
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
Are you overestimating yourself?

176
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,840
Even if he had to

177
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,320
do half of his effort to hate you,

178
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
it's a good thing.

179
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,920
I just don't want him to be like this.

180
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,960
I don't want him to have

181
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,640
only work and wife in his life.

182
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,200
What else does he have in his life?

183
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,840
He has someone to protect.

184
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,600
We're the same.

185
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,760
Qi Chu, can you cheer up?

186
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,320
What are you doing?

187
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,400
Do we have a mission?

188
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Are you going to do it or not?

189
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,720
Sister.

190
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,280
Sister.

191
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,960
Sister.

192
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,600
Sister.

193
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,280
Sister.

194
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,960
Let go.

195
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,840
Let go.

196
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,160
Where did you go?

197
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,960
Sister, we're on a mission.

198
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,320
I'm asking him.

199
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Where did you go?

200
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
Where did you go?

201
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,320
I...

202
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,760
I caught the suspect.

203
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,720
So Zhao Shi,

204
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
in your heart,

205
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,680
the case

206
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,040
is always more important than your daughter,

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,240
right?

208
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
Miss Du,

209
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,360
it is my fault.

210
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,560
No.

211
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,000
It is me.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,960
I was wrong.

213
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,720
Mr. Du,

214
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,640
I'm applying for action.

215
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,400
Don't move.

216
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,280
Meng Yang.

217
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,960
Don't move.

218
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,640
We have to go.

219
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,160
General Manager Suyssrell

220
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,720
Is the place of lockdown

221
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,000
friendly for kids?

222
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,240
According to our analysis,

223
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,640
if they flight

224
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,940
of lead and gift

225
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,960
They must avoid

226
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,580
the escape routes

227
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,200
withเพalabin

228
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,780
As long as they are services

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,500
in rapid mode

230
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,280
and trans autonomously

231
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,820
they are very likely to escape

232
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,640
findings can't be known

233
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,200
First, we need to find a hidden place to lock the door.

234
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,680
Second, we need to find a place that's easy to use and easy to transport.

235
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,120
Then what place can meet these conditions?

236
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,680
Inner river port.

237
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,720
There are more than ten ports around Tai Ning.

238
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,040
For business, civil and non-business.

239
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
The scope needs to be reduced.

240
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,240
We've sent Qi Chu to investigate.

241
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,320
I believe it will be done soon.

242
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
Long Pillar

243
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,640
Director Du.

244
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,320
Qi Chu sent a message.

245
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,620
coloured Gray

246
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,140
Don't you think such a serious matter can Nature huh

247
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,720
Especially for you

248
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,260
Your drama cake can attract a lot of readers

249
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,660
difference

250
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,260
This entire small world

251
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,980
Really

252
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,160
Can it be one piece

253
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,240
Two pieces

254
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,220
Two pieces

255
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,540
I am talking about it

256
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,620
You won't be able to arrest anyone

257
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,700
Reversing

258
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,380
Sir

259
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,520
They'resized here

260
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,020
Four times surveillance

261
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Yes

262
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,760
You forgot.

263
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,960
They're the girl?

264
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,800
You forgot so slowly?

265
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,960
Not glad to see you're worried?

266
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,080
What's wrong with you?

267
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,520
You are like

268
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,800
a team leader and Bluetooth.

269
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,000
All you do is

270
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,760
listen to the girl.

271
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,480
Why can't she be?

272
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,920
I weights her and

273
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,680
all of my aspects.

274
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,400
You got a total fault!

275
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,080
I don't deserve to be 저도ized!

276
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Where am I?

277
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Where am I?

278
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
I can't help it

279
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
The unknown night flowers

280
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
Remind me of the time

281
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
It makes me panic

282
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
In the wind

283
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Loneliness opens up

284
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,820
To the farthest place where the eyes are locked

285
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
I change

286
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
A piece of grass

287
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,820
To stop here

288
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,320
Is it satisfaction

289
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Or another kind of progress?

290
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,320
I'm going into the mouth

291
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,320
To continue this endless journey

292
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Is there freedom ahead?

293
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Or is it just a piece of broken bone?

294
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I've crossed a few lines

295
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,820
I've been through many hardships

296
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
And I've just begun to regret

297
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,320
The sudden death of my past

298
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,320
I've crossed a few lines

299
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,320
And I've just broken a few books

300
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,820
Only then did I realize happiness

301
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,820
I can't catch it, I can't keep it

302
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,820
