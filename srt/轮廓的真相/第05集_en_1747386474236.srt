Taoism Grandmaster

Episode 18

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Zhao Xue, eat something.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Zhao Xue.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Eat.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Remember.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
3.30 pm.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The first floor of the Youth Palace.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Say it again.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
1.30 pm. The third floor of the Youth Palace.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
3.30 pm. The first floor.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
3.30 pm.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Qiqi, I'm leaving.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The target has appeared.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A short memory like this

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
can be very different

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
if it's just a description

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
of a person's nose and eyes.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But if it's a description

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
of a person's body,

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
chest,

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
it's more valuable

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
to me.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's valuable.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It means

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
the facial features of this person

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
are in an abnormal position.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They don't coordinate.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
For me,

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
features are more important than details.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Since you can draw,

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
why do you still come to the village?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because light is also important.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Enough.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Left.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
A bit to the left.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Turn.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Turn your face back a bit.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I've lit it.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't move.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not time yet.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It'll be darker later.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't move.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why are you so straightforward to me?

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why are you not like Zhao Shi?

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you have any objection?

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't think I don't know.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You two

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
have secrets.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't answer me.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I like to investigate this kind of gossip myself.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You'll never find out.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I said

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
you'll never find out.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't underestimate me.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm...

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Turn off the fire.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think...

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't move.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
According to my theory...

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't move.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Turn around.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Turn a bit.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Turn around.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Turn around.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Turn around.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Raise your head.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's so strong.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hold on.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Have you seen this person?

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How about this one?

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Is this one similar?

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It seems not.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How about this one?

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's a bit similar.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
A bit similar?

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Is it him?

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's him.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Zhao Zhi.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This should be the person's face.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's him.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You know him?

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Wu Chuwei.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I caught him four years ago.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I have an impression of this Wu Chuwei.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He was deliberately charged with a fire in 2006.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He served three years in our prison.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But in the year of the arrest,

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
he was suddenly arrested for a serious fight

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and was held for six months.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you know the reason for the fight?

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Ten years ago, his son disappeared.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
His wife couldn't think of it

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and committed suicide with the drug.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As a result, the people in the same room

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
provoked him with something.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He had a conflict with that person.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
His child was lost?

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Was he kidnapped?

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The criminal hasn't been released yet.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Captain.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You two talk.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll go out and get it.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I think I've touched it.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What did you touch?

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The truth.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Think about it.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yang Dong and Liu Kui are old friends.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They must have known

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and even participated in the human trafficking.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Then Wu Chuwei's son...

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wu Chuwei's son was kidnapped.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
After he was released,

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
he wanted revenge.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Wang Ziyan was killed by Wu.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Wu Chuwei didn't want to kill Wang Ziyan.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He wanted to kill Yang Dong.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Zhao Zhi, I've found it.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Wu Chuwei is working at Jixiang Bar.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The bar is in the west street of the vegetable market.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, I got it.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Take someone there.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We'll meet on the way.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That means Wu Chuwei

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
was in Yang Dong's house in advance

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and wanted to take revenge.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
As a result, he accidentally killed

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Wu Chuwei.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Wu Chuwei has been following Yang Dong.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Will he know anything about the smuggling of the troupe?

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We'll know soon.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Where is he?

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Outside.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Zhao Li, Zhao Liang, there's a car behind.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's okay.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's go.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's go.

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Wu Chuwei.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Stop.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Wu Chuwei.

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Go.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Go to the front.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Go.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Go.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Go.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Go.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Go.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Go.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Go.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Go.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Go.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Don't move.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Go.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Wu Chuwei, you're involved in the murder.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You'll be arrested by the law.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Go.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Go.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Stop looking.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Leave.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The police are handling the case.

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Go back.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Leave.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm coming.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Stop looking.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Go.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Stop looking.

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Go back.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Kid, why are you here alone?

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Where's your family?

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Go find your family.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't lose them.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The police are here.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Leave.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Go.

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Go.

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's his bad luck.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He's not blaming anyone.

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Wu Chuwei.

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why did you set the fire?

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I wanted to save trouble.

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Help.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Go.

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I thought it was Yang Dong.

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I found out I killed the wrong person.

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Pan Pan Pan Pan Pan Pan Pan.

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Isn't that a death?

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Your death

201
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
doesn't mean you can kill someone else.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
My wife's life is gone.

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
My son's life is gone.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm keeping his life.

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I have to kill him.

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If I have a chance,

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll kill him.

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I have to kill him.

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm not afraid of death.

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm not afraid of death.

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm not afraid of death.

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I have to kill him.

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
How's your hand?

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's beef.

215
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I can't eat it.

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You bought this for me?

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes.

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm just a little hungry.

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Who?

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Be honest.

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Zhao Zhi.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Who is this?

224
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You don't have anything else?

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Where's Wang Ziyan's report?

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Remember to sign it.

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Does he look like this?

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I think

229
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
he will.

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

231
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mr. Zhou.

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

233
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Mr. Zhou.

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Master.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I re-drew it.

236
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No.

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You have to understand what the witness said first.

238
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Then you can continue.

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Where's Xinxin?

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
She went back early.

241
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I know.

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She finished her homework.

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
She's playing.

244
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Did you buy her an ice cream again?

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Of course.

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
How can she write without buying homework?

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Xinxin.

248
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Xinxin.

249
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Xinxin.

250
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Xinxin.

251
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Xinxin.

252
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm sorry.
