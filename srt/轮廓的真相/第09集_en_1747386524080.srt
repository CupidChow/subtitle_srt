00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Taoism Grandmaster

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The time of death should be between 9 and 11 this morning.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The broken neck should be the cause of death.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It looks like it was cut off by a human.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And there are some footprints left on the ground next to it.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
These steps are not even.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The first few steps are similar.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But there is a slight increase here.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It should be a slight pause and then a correction.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
One could be the murderer's injury.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Another could be the health of the body.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Judging from this footstep,

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the murderer's height should be around 1.75 meters.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The weight is about 70 kg.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And the pattern on the foot is worn out.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The murderer should be between 35 and 40 years old.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Zhao Zhi, if Guonong says that the car belongs to him,

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think it was a car accident when Yang Dong escaped from the car.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But we haven't found any other witnesses yet.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Does anyone in the village know him?

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No. They all said they haven't seen him.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He should have appeared here by accident.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Accident?

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Zhao Zhi.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let me have a look.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There is a print here.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you think Yang Dong's death spot is special?

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's change the angle.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What is special about Yang Dong?

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why did he choose to park his car there?

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Judging from the traces of the rubbed floor,

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the speed has reached its limit.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why did he run away when no one knew him?

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And the mud on the floor comes from the river.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why did he go to the river with the murderer?

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Wu Shouwei said that Liu Kui was looking for Yang Dong's hideout.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Could it be around here?

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Liu Kui?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Did Yang Dong's phone data recover?

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Lin Chen said it would take about an hour.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll go urge him.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I have to go to Liu Kui's transportation company.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Now?

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We don't know them well.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We don't know the relationship between Liu Kui and Yang Dong.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We don't know what Liu Kui is trying to steal.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We can't solve the case.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Zhao Zhi, I'll go with you.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Go where?

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Stay at home.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't call me Zhao Zhi.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm still your master.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Liu Kui's Hideout

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Master, I'm here.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You...

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who are you?

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm a landlady.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm here to find my relatives.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've been asking for a long time and I don't know.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I just want to ask.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm here to find my relatives.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm here to find my relatives.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I just want to ask.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come in.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Sure.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Sure.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You don't know?

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've asked for a long time.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're all locals.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How come you don't know anything?

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're here to find people?

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You've found the right person.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've been here for a lifetime.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How can you not recognize me?

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You've found the right person.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's great.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hurry up.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is my relative.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Look.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you recognize me?

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This...

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What?

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This...

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This...

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Isn't this our boss,

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Kui?

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Liu Kui.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Kui is your boss?

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're so smart.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Kui is your boss.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're a family.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're a family.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're a family.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Look at me.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Come.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nothing good.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A little wine.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
A little wine.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Come.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
A family.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm happy.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Come.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm happy.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Master.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Where can I find Kui?

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Where can you find him?

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I want to find him.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I haven't paid for a long time.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's gone.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He ran away.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This...

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What was this place used for?

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Did you see it?

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
These stones in the yard.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you know what they're for?

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What for?

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
For the field and the sea.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's a big business.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Big business.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's amazing.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Amazing.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Have you seen anyone

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
around Kui?

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Do you remember anyone?

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I remember when the business was good,

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I brought a little girl back.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Little girl?

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She just got out of the hospital at the age of 20.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She's beautiful.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank you.

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Girlfriend.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Girlfriend.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How can such a young girl

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
be Kui's girlfriend?

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Kui, Kui.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Amazing.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's very intimate.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The boss has money.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes.

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Kui's girlfriend.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm the police.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm investigating the various luxury night clubs

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
such as the Beauty Palace.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The crime scene is that

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
there are 47 girls in the black room

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and the night club is occupied by the bad place.

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Who is it?

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm the police.

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm investigating the high-pressure situation

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and I'm determined to eradicate social exclusion.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Brother Wuchong, why are you here?

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Rui Rui.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I just passed by your house.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So I bought this flower.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I forgot.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The boss said

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
you can't take it.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well,

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I saw her for a few days

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and she didn't come to school.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is she sick?

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She's not at home.

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you see her,

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
remember to tell her

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that I'm looking for her.

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't worry. I'll tell her.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And...

177
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Rui Rui.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Who is it?

179
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Who else?

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Your favorite senior,

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Brother Wuchong.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're not going to school?

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No.

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll sign for you.

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I love you.

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Brother Wuchong left?

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What?

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Are you jealous?

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hani ran away from someone.

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Did I say something wrong?

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't move.

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
When did you learn to explode?

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You've been gone for almost two years.

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You know

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
a lot about me.

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You regret taking me in?

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Listen.

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't pretend to be pitiful.

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm back.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm back.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Are you leaving?

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Liu Kui is a social brother.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He must have a lot of girlfriends.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Didn't you check it before?

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Liu Kui has no relatives or friends in Tai Ning.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know where this girlfriend is.

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We can only track her down to the Qingmen District.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Then the number will be turned off.

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you sure this number is Liu Kui?

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hello?

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Do you remember Dai Qian's husband

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
has a foreign trade company?

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Zhao Zhi, the owner's name is Dai Qian.

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He's married.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Her husband is the boss of a foreign trade company.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
His name is Chen Zhengwei.

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It seems to be called Yang.

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Foreign trade company.

221
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It looks familiar.

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But I really don't know his name.

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
His name is Liu Kui.

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Four years ago,

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
we held a logistics meeting.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
All of you bosses have participated.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He's here too.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
A logistics meeting.

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Here, it's hot.

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Thank you.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Four years ago...

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I remember now.

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He seems to be doing

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
some mining business.

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There's also a business outside the city.

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes, he's doing mining.

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What did you talk about that day?

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And who are there with you?

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Mr. Qian,

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we businessmen

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
are doing this kind of activity

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
to make money and make a name for ourselves.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There's nothing else.

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's okay, don't worry.

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Let's think about it.

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Anything is fine.

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Anything can be said.

248
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Anything is fine?

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Anything.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Is it convenient?

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Convenient.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You know.

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's convenient.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Next, let's welcome

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
the chairman of the Yiyang Commercial Trade

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Mr. Chen Zhengwei to come up to the stage.

257
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Everyone,

258
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm very happy to have everyone

259
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
come to our...

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What are you doing here?

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Don't look at me.

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What are you doing here?

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Picking vegetables.

264
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Where's the stuff?

265
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll go get it now.

266
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Do you know where it is?

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Which school?

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're an adult now?

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll go get the tools first.

270
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Wait a minute.

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you know the rules?

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're too confused.

273
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Don't touch me.

274
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This...

275
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Who are you?

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The future of a common good.

277
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Good.

278
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It hurts.

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It hurts.

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It hurts.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let's go.

282
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's okay.

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Do you remember

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
what the girl's name was?

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The girl...

286
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know.

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
How about this?

288
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Go ask the supervisor.

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's more intuitive.

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay?

291
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
My clothes are all wet.

292
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Slow down.

293
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Are you cold?

294
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No.

295
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Lanlan,

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
you've really gotten back together with Liu Kun.

297
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm hungry.

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But you were so sad

299
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
when you broke up.

300
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Now you're forgiving him so quickly.

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is the first time

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I've ever seen you like this.

303
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Although it's not the first time,

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I believe

305
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
that Liu Kun is a good man.

306
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Send me home.

307
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm not a little boy.

308
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't have time to spend time with you.

309
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I know.

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You might not be able to see me often.

311
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I know.

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is this what you want?

313
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes.

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But why did he suddenly come back to you?

315
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And the wounds on his body.

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Did you ask him

317
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
what happened?

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Shui Rui,

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I know you're worried about me.

320
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes.

321
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He's much older than me.

322
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And we have a lot of secrets.

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But I really don't care about these.

324
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I just want to be with him.

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Why?

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know either.

327
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But

328
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
when you really fall in love with someone,

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I will understand.

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's love.

331
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm sorry.

383
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
