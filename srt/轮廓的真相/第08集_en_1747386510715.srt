The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 2

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Taoism Grandmaster

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Taoism Grandmaster

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Wu Shouwei said there was a fight here.

10
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But I saw how it was cleaned up.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Xiaozhou, have you done the fluorescent reaction?

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I did.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Taoist.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Turn off the light.

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It seems that Wu Shouwei is right.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
According to the brightness and brightness,

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
it happened within two weeks.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Within two weeks?

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Taoist, I found...

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I told you to turn on the light.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Turn it off.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The time is the least.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yang Dong and Liu Kui came out of the maze

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and hid in the basement.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Zhang Liang.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Zhang Liang.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's turn on the light.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I found an important clue.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The hospital.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The保健院.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The保健院

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you sure?

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's Yang Dong's room.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yang Dong is a big light stick.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How can there be a collection of the保健院?

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The police.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They asked us a few questions.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Look at this.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Have you seen this?

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is not from us.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you sure?

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It says the hospital.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The保健院.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I've been working here for five years.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I've never seen this kind of collection.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Ms. Liu.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Look. Is this ours?

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is not from us.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In 2001, we changed it to a chicken.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
2001?

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was handwritten more than ten years ago.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now it's gone.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The保健院

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Lin Mo Si.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Luo Hai Xiao.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a bad name.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I said,

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
your new name

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is really bad.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Say it.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why do you want the wine?

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want those gold bars

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and the things.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Impossible.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You mean...

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I want the gold bars?

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I want the gold bars.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I want the gold bars.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I want the gold bars.

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,740
Everybody is the parents of aattiere.

74
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,740
Of course I have to be the son of a shuttler.

75
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,720
That's wrong.

76
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,340
Mother said

77
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,420
no sign of family ties between two Germans.

78
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
Durygom showed no evidence.

79
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,160
No sign of someone related to him.

80
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,980
I asked him to show evidence

81
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,380
You owe me and Xiao Jiang.

82
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,740
At that time,

83
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,340
Dou Han was still a writer.

84
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,580
What?

85
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,460
The entry into the Academy to establish a party,

86
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,540
the birth certificate,

87
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,220
and all kinds of records.

88
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,980
Dou Han could have made a fake record.

89
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,460
As long as you were willing to pay,

90
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,020
you could have done it.

91
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,540
Every minute,

92
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,420
you could have become someone else.

93
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,700
So that record

94
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,420
was used to fake the identity of the child.

95
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
That's what you police did.

96
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:16,980
Miss.

97
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,820
Here's the stuff.

98
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,780
What?

99
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,900
I really brought it today.

100
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,500
I'll look for it.

101
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
What's this?

102
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,060
No need.

103
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,700
No need.

104
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,020
No need.

105
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,860
No need. I brought it.

106
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,500
I really brought it.

107
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,220
I borrowed it.

108
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,060
I borrowed it.

109
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,060
There's news from Mr. Yang.

110
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,660
Who is it?

111
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,420
I'll call him.

112
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,420
Say it.

113
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,620
There's news from Mr. Yang.

114
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,220
He made a fake record.

115
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,060
Where is he?

116
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,740
I'll go there now.

117
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,740
Don't be anxious.

118
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,500
He can't run away with the record.

119
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,340
Can you not be anxious?

120
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,020
Say it now.

121
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,820
Zhao.

122
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,380
When can you be more relaxed?

123
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
I'm not relaxed.

124
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,340
Don't joke.

125
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,740
Wait.

126
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,060
Can these people

127
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,060
be trusted?

128
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,660
Here.

129
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,540
Where's the stuff?

130
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,900
It's been eight years.

131
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
Why do you think it's mine?

132
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,780
I really don't know.

133
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,740
Liu Kui is using you.

134
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,260
Because you have gold bars.

135
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
You're looking for it.

136
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,780
Liu Kui is looking for it.

137
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,220
Why do you think it's mine?

138
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,340
Where are the gold bars?

139
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,180
I really don't know.

140
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,500
I really don't know.

141
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,700
You put it here.

142
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,500
Right?

143
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,220
Put it here.

144
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,340
Or here?

145
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,060
I'm different from them.

146
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,220
You're all the same.

147
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,380
I'm doing this for the country.

148
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,800
I'm transparent as a boat.

149
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,700
Rong Caixiao.

150
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,860
I'll take you to the bath.

151
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,860
I found it.

152
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,900
These are the foundation.

153
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,020
This is Yang Dong.

154
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
You changed your name.

155
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,260
Did the fake witness say anything?

156
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,820
He said

157
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,420
Yang Dong didn't do it himself.

158
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,900
It was another man who took him to do it.

159
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,820
And that man

160
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,580
also had a new ID card

161
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,180
in his pocket a few months ago.

162
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,220
This is it.

163
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,820
Luo Hai Xiao.

164
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,140
Director gasoline

165
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,620
Stuff is in there.

166
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,780
Let's go.

167
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,980
Why is the water so big?

168
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,740
It's the season now.

169
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
If you cut the water yourself,

170
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,060
you won't be able to get it.

171
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,340
When will we be able to get it?

172
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,460
Winter.

173
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,580
Here.

174
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,960
Klar puree

175
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,020
What are you doing?

176
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Brother Tai,

177
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,020
why are you like this?

178
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,020
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
Brother Tai,

180
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,020
I'm sorry.

181
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,020
I'm sorry.

182
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,020
Brother Tai,

183
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
Brother Tai,

185
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,020
we have to be a ghost for a lifetime.

186
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,020
Since we're going to die,

187
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
don't listen.

188
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,020
Don't let them go.

189
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,020
Brother,

190
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,020
come on.

191
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Are you serious?

192
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
Brother,

193
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
I'm sorry.

194
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
I'm sorry.

195
