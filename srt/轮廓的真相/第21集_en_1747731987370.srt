We're in trouble, brother.

Brother, after we finish the Tang City,

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
we'll have a good life with gold.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You'd better think it over.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Whether you take these things or not,

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,200
Put the gold in the trunk of the black car.

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,960

I'm here.

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,800
Mom.

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,680
Point here.

106
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,320
This is yourpass.

107
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
Be careful.

108
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,120
Okay, let's go.

109
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,840
We are in charge.

110
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,920

111
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,200

Put coins into some indulgentvätsy.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040

I am here.

115
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,320
Tay.

116
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:43,920
Hello?

117
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,400
Officer Zhao,

118
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
guess how did Su Yun find out

119
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,080
thatывï presiding over the hitchhike?

120
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,040
Come on.

121
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,800
I could give you another gift.

122
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,800
Everything will be lost

123
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,480
if we fail.

124
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,080
Do not play tricks!

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,440
There are 80 taels of big bags in this parking lot

126
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,320
and 20 taels of trucks.

127
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,960
There is a warehouse on both sides.

128
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,040
That is the dormitory.

129
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,320
There is a gas station

130
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,400
on each side of the southeast corner and southwest corner.

131
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,360
There is a gas station on the southmost side.

132
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,920
There are eight gas stations in total.

133
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,880
Zhiyuan is on the way.

134
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,400
Our main task is to save the hostage.

135
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
Team Two, check the warehouse first.

136
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,720
Okay, let's go.

137
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,040
Mom.

138
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll kill you tonight.

139
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,520
Xiao Hai.

140
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm sure I won't die today.

141
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,880
Let's go.

142
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,160
Think about it.

143
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
What do you want most?

144
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,440
Gold?

145
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,280
Me?

146
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Your daughter.

147
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
There are two Xia Erlai's men.

148
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,160
They are heavily injured.

149
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,800
Let's go.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Mr. Bai De wrote this letter on the paper.

151
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,240
A young girl

152
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,480
with a longketar lived with her mother.

153
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,880
A young girl would stay married with men.

154
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,960
How shameful it is!

155
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,420
You aren't a young girl.

156
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,560
You are getting popular!

157
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,880
I'm less popular!

158
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,520
Oh my God.

159
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
It's alright.

160
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
I can still be famous today.

161
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
Min Zhe.

162
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,700
Yin повы.

163
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,380
You...

164
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,020
Stop!

165
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,500
It's not appropriate to kill him.

166
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,980
It's not appropriate.

167
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,300
Zhao Shi!

168
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,100
Master!

169
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
guess I'm going myself?

170
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:42,900
You...

171
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,420
Motmalo!

172
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,460
But I...

173
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,900
I've prepared this thing till now.

174
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,060
I shall show you my ease.

175
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,860
Please do not tell this to those who informed you.

176
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,580
But taking this blame

177
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
is for such an abominable reason

178
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,940
but you must bear its consequences back.

179
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,620
However,

180
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,620

181
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,540

Hurry up. We're late again.

184
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,780
Hurry up. We're late.

185
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,380
Uncle.

186
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,380
Come on, Qiqi.

187
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,980
Well,

188
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,500
the show is at 3.30.

189
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,060
It's at the hall on the first floor of the Youth Palace.

190
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,620
Don't forget.

191
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:32,940
Okay.

192
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,660
There's water in the bag.

193
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,100
Dad said my hair was ugly.

194
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,940
It's too late.

195
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,220
I'll tell you later.

196
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,460
I'm talking about your hair.

197
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,100
Okay.

198
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,700
Okay.

199
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,340
Is it good?

200
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,860
Yes.

201
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,660
Okay.

202
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,620
I'm leaving.

203
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,180
Darling,

204
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,140
have a good show.

205
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,620
When you come back,

206
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,900
I'll be your only audience.

207
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,260
Okay?

208
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,900
Watch it again.

209
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,340
Okay?

210
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,500
Qiqi,

211
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,060
I'll find you.

212
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,860
I will.

213
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,300
Zhao Zhi.

214
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,820
Luo Haixiao.

215
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,380
Gu.

216
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,780
Don't worry.

217
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,620
Gu is safe now.

218
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,380
She'll be taken good care of

219
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,620
in the children's home.

220
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,460
Why did you

221
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,740
lie on her bed?

222
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,100
Because I have a daughter.

223
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,780
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,660
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,380
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,220
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,140
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,980
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,820
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,780
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,660
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,460
No, I'm sorry.

233
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,820
You know my intention to

234
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,260
let her go down

235
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,260
and made it bad.

236
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,020
If it can't be fixed,

237
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,260
plate it even worse.

238
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,620
I'm so stupid.

239
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,860
Yao.

240
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,580
Tighten your raise too.

241
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,260
Okay?

242
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,460
Three from above.

243
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,880
Failed.

244
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,780
Let people

245
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,780
In the wind

246
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,780
Lonely and open

247
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,780
To the farthest place of the eyes

248
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,780
I wear a piece of grass

249
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Stop here

250
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,780
Is it satisfied

251
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,780
Or another kind of attack

252
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,140
I'm going into the mouth

253
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,140
Continue the endless journey

254
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Is there freedom ahead

255
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,140
Or is it broken

256
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,140
Passing through the double line

257
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,140
I've taught a few lessons

258
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Just started to miss

259
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,140
The mountain valley of the hair

260
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,140
Can't cry

261
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,140
Can't give up

262
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,140
Only until happiness

263
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,140
Can't catch
