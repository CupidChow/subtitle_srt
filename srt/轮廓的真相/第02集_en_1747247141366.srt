00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Episode 18

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you want to go back to Tai Ning,

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Mom asked you to go back?

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yang Dong is in Japan.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Mom asked me to go back and find him to get something.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've been hiding it for 8 years.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I should take it out.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yang Dong, something happened.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Check the blood.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The blood is all out.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Welcome, Mr. Du.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We have limited conditions.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The meeting room is ready.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All the information is in there.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go this way.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay, hurry up.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
After finding Liu Kui,

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Comrade Zhao Shi

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
reported to the command post immediately

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and asked for immediate collection.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We decided

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to start the arrest plan

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and informed the sub-enforcer team

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to cooperate.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Due to the information gap,

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
your sub-enforcer team

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
has gone to the area

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
to carry out the sweep task.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The collision with the accident

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
caused the misunderstanding last night.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mr. Du, Mr. Guo,

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
we received a report from the public last night

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that the meritorious service

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
had a smuggling act.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We conducted a surprise check.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I apologize for

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
affecting your action.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's all for work.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can understand.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Although there were no Liu Kui

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
arrested on the spot last night,

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
there were 8 women who were blamed

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and were successfully rescued by us.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This result is enough to show

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that our action direction is correct.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Next,

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the sub-enforcer team

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
will cooperate with the operations team.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Mr. Guo,

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to ask you for a person.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is the person you're looking for.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
to let you suffer here for a night.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Liu Kui, you let him go, right?

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Chief Zhao,

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
what happened yesterday was a misunderstanding.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But don't worry about Liu Kui.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll definitely catch him.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Liu Kui is the task of our special investigation team.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I won't bother you.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's wrong with you?

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We're in a tight schedule now.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We have a lot of tasks.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We lack people.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Gu Xinhe

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
was the fighting champion

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
of last year's

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
All-State Skill Contest.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Think about it.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you want to

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
bring him in?

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why are you all standing there?

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The food is getting cold.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Shouldn't the person who cooperated with me last night

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
be Xiaozhou?

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why did you change the person?

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I've reported it.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mr. Du approved it.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Li You,

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you're not the one who should be punished.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Li You.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I must be there to catch Liu Kui.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What do you mean you must be there?

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Do you know why you asked Xiaozhou to go?

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's because she's good at martial arts.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If something goes wrong, she'll cooperate with you.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What can you do?

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If it weren't for Gu Xinhe yesterday,

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
we would have been...

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm talking about you now.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Qi Chu, you're a portrait artist.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're not Zhang Qianxian.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Take the money and get out of here.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm not leaving.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Say that again.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I said I'm not leaving.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is an order.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're overreacting.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is catching Liu Kui.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're overreacting too.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll beat you if you don't believe me.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Fine. I'll beat you.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you done yet?

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm almost done.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're a traitor.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're embarrassing me.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mr. Du, the meeting is about to start.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Zhao Zhi, come with me.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Say something.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What do you want to know?

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How did you work?

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We only work for Liu Kui.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We usually go to the talent market

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to pick some new girls.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I want to go home.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I want to go home!

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Where did you sell most of them?

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Outside the police station.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
In the police station.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How many people did you transfer?

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
About 20 to 30.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
20 to 30?

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's the exact route?

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Who's the intercom?

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I really don't know.

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
As long as I leave the gate of the Beauty Palace,

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
everything else has nothing to do with me.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Touch it.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Touch it.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Touch it.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Say it.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm in charge of transporting people to Wangshan Port.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The thing outside the police station

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
is being done by another group of people.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But this time...

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's wrong with this time?

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What's wrong?

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This time,

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Liu Kui didn't just come to trade.

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It seems...

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It seems that he's still looking for someone.

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Looking for someone?

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Who?

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yang Dong.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
After talking about business,

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
let's talk about us.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Where is Yang Dong?

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How can I know where he is?

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I want to ask you.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why are you still nervous

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
when you're talking about your old lover?

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm nervous.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have many old lovers.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
When will Yang Dong

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
be in my eyes?

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's you.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Where is he?

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't know.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not only taking away the goods today,

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
but also taking away Yang Dong.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If I don't see him,

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll have to

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
bury his daughter.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll leave after I'm done.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Take away Yang Dong

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
or take away you.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's up to you.

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I hid Yang Dong.

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He said

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
no one could find him.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Go home.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll see who dares to run away today.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yang Dong?

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why did Liu Ke look for him?

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ask him.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Check.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please redial later.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Luo Si.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Long time no see.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's been eight years.

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's not worth it.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No one has bullied you

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
in these years, right?

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
They dare not.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm not afraid of them.

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm not afraid of them.

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm not afraid of them.

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not afraid of them.

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
They dare not.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is the result of the new joint interrogation.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The manager of the construction company, Ma Li,

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
had a boyfriend ten years ago

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
named Yang Dong.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yang Dong was sentenced to eight years

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
for deliberately hurting

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in 2002.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He was released from prison a month ago.

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
According to Liu Kui's bodyguard,

209
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Liu Kui returned to China

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to find Yang Dong.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why did you look for him?

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know yet.

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But from what Ma Li said,

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yang Dong doesn't seem to

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
want Liu Kui to be found.

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
One is found and one is hidden.

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's interesting.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
When we arrived at the construction site yesterday,

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yang Dong ran away in a mess.

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We don't know where he is now.

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
There is his address on it.

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Check it quickly.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Sorry, we have a limit.

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The construction team is very bold.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Please check it.

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Very good.

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yang Dong.

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You are the police?

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Did you find me?

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You are a stupid woman.

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You can't even wipe your ass.

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Since you are out,

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
why didn't you go home?

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Mom was looking for you.

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I have a home now.

237
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Are you a fool?

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You even forgot who you are.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Brother, it's been eight years.

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I've been in there for eight years.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't want to cause that much trouble.

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If you don't want to cause trouble,

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
just hand over the stuff.

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Hand over it and you'll be fine.

245
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Since I was a kid,

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I carried all the black bones.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I thought it was me.

248
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yang Dong,

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
you never lied since you were a kid.

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Brother,

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I really don't know.

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Enough!

253
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Where is the paper?

254
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll take it.

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Pull the rope.

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Where is it?

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can't bear it.

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You are so dirty.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think your special case team is not enough.

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Our national police department said

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
they will do their best to cooperate with you.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you need anything, just mention it.

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Don't be polite.

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Look.

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I didn't prepare anything.

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What are we going to Hongxing Village for?

267
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Zhao Shi.

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hello, Zhao Shi.

271
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm Guo, the leader of Hongxing Village.

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The leader said you were looking for Yang Dong.

273
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes.

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We are going to your office to find out.

275
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Call him here.

276
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We need to investigate.

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But Yang Dong is dead.

278
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Dead?

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000

331
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000

334
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000

I'm sorry.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000

361
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
