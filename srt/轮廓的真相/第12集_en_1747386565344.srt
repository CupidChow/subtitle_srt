Episode 18

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This...

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Rui Rui.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They hit you again.

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't hold it anymore.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What are you doing?

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to run.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But when we get here,

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
you can jump off.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Come on, come home with me.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Every time, my brother's clothes are all my fault.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can't help it today.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I fought with him a few times.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That guy made him faint and burned me.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
My mother was watching me.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They are the family.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you're tired,

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you can count on me.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How long can I stay?

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How long can you stay?

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Come on, come home with me.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come on, come home with me.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Come on, come home with me.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Come on, come home with me.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Come on, come home with me.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Come on, come home with me.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Come on, come home with me.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Come on, come home with me.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Come on, come home with me.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Come on, come home with me.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Come on, come home with me.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Come on, come home with me.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Come on, come home with me.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come on, come home with me.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Come on, come home with me.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Come on, come home with me.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come on, come home with me.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on, come home with me.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come on, come home with me.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Come on, come home with me.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Come on, come home with me.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on, come home with me.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Come on, come home with me.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Come on.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Sister.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why are you up?

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Sister,

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
can you pour me a glass of water?

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I just pressed the nurse's bell,

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but there was no one coming.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I was really thirsty.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll go get some water.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
Lie down.

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,240
Thank you.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yirui!

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yirui!

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't move! Be careful!

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We're the police.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We're here to help you.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Calm down.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yirui.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I know.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can't accept Yao Lan leaving.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But you're not the one who hurt her.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's Wu Cong.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's Liu Kui.

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Trust me.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll catch them.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let them face you

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
in front of you.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Face you.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll go get you and Yao Lan.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yirui, stop!

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yirui!

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Wu Cong!

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't move!

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's okay.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't move.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's okay.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's okay.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's okay.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's okay.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Here.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Slowly.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yirui.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's okay.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's okay.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's okay.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yirui.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're suspected of murder.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're under arrest for your crime.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I got it.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's him.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Go and check.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll go.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You go.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What about you?

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Go.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How can you suspect me?

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm the victim.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The victim.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The victim.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
How do you explain this?

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The drug dealer has already identified you.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He said you bought the drugs.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's impossible.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Even if you can fool those people,

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you can't fool me.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Even if you only show your back,

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can still turn your face around.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Even if I bought the drugs,

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I can't prove that I was the one who drugged them.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yao Lan wasn't killed by the drugs.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He was a secret agent.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is the fingerprint on your bathtub.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Isn't it normal for my bathroom to have my fingerprints?

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But your fingerprints have Yao Lan's burglary.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And the position he was printed on

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
was enough to prove that your posture

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
was to press Yao Lan's head into the bathtub.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You did it very carefully.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If you hadn't used the poison to wipe off the fingerprints,

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm afraid we wouldn't have found the evidence.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You know that

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
we can find the conflict between you and your brother.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So you want to use his Poison Dog Needle

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to frame him.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What?

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You want to play a trick on us?

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You want to play a trick on us?

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I never prepared to frame Guo Long.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That drug was prepared for him.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You want to kill Guo Long?

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Since I was 14 years old,

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
my mother took my brother away.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Later,

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
she didn't even want my brother.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Guo Long started to look for me.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He wanted money.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He always wanted money.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
All these years,

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yao Lan has been protecting you.

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I've been living in Lan Lan's house since I was 15.

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You must look good in this dress.

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We went to the same university together.

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We've never been apart.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
As long as he's here,

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I won't be afraid.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll be with you.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We moved many times.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But Guo Long still found us.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He knew that Yao Lan's boyfriend had money,

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
so he started to threaten us.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I have no money for you.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm not here for money.

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm here to be your guest.

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't touch me.

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm so happy.

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Guo Long, what are you doing?

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're so nice.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Your brother is suffering outside.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're enjoying your life here, right?

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Guo Long, what are you doing?

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I have no money.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm not here for money.

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm here for the stamp.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You promised me last month.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Come here.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I have no money.

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I...

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Sister,

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm here to bring you a gift.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
A note.

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's in my hand.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Your best friend has money.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You can ask him for it.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No way.

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Guo Long, let me tell you.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If you dare to go to Yao Lan...

188
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've done a lot of things.

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I've been a man of principle and discipline.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If I don't get the money by noon tomorrow,

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll give him a gift one by one.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Get out!

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is a gift.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Come on.

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let him try it.

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
As long as he dares to come,

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll fire him immediately.

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't be angry.

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Ning Rui Rui,

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
how can you do this?

201
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You have to find a way

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
to break up with this family completely.

203
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Completely?

204
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But...

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What are you afraid of?

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Ning Rui Rui.

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why are you so easy to bully?

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Forget it.

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's useless to be angry.

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Anyway, don't be afraid.

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll protect you.

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yao Lan is the only one

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
in this world

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
who wants to protect me.

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He's so nice to me.

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
How can I let Guo Rong hurt him?

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So you decided to poison Guo Rong

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
to protect yourself and Yao Lan?

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Where are you, mom?

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm in the People's Hospital.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There's a bed and a bed.

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I've searched every corner.

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There's no one here.

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The Central Hospital?

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Which hospital?

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why did you search the Central Hospital when the accident happened?

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Accident?

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Accident?

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean the accident.

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Guo Rong, you lied to me again.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Who said I was lying to you?

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Do you know that 20,000 yuan

233
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
is my last savings?

234
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I was supposed to...

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Give it to you.

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Anyway, it's all empty.

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't need it.

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I was supposed to go to Shanghai

239
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
for an interview today.

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I went.

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll have a chance.

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Everything will be fine.

243
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I just need one chance.

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I just need this chance.

245
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So?

246
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why are you crying here?

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Go now.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm scared.

249
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's too late.

250
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If it's too late, you'll die.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Turn around and fall down.

252
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This kind of poisonous drug

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
is already available in their store.

254
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Even if he's poisoned,

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
people will think

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
he's hurt by his own poison.

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This kind of thing

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
is often found in their store.

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What about Wu Tong?

260
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why did you kill him?

261
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Mr. Wu.

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Mr. Wu.

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He's just a

264
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
self-made nerd.

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He forgot who he is

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
after drinking too much.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He dared to bully Yao Lan.

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
He was knocked out by me.

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Why did you kill Yao Lan?

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Because Lan Lan doesn't want me anymore.

271
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Lan Lan.

272
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Lan Lan, don't be impulsive.

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This person has a problem.

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Maybe his money...

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What's wrong with money?

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I just like him.

277
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's wrong with him?

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Think about it.

279
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
How long have you two broken up?

280
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He disappeared and disappeared.

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He said he was in a bad mood.

282
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You know Liu Kui?

283
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If he's lying to you...

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not lying.

285
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Lan Lan.

286
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He's back.

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He's back.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm going.

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Lan Lan, you...

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Kui.

291
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Kui.

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Kui.

293
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Kui.
