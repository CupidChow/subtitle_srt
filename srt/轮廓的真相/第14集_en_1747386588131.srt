The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 18

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's go.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Why is Liu taking the ball?

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to wash my hair.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What are you doing?

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What is this?

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why isn't he wearing clothes?

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm not wearing clothes.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's right.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't see.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How can I see the photos if I can't open the camera?

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
After this photo is taken,

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
you can wash it.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How can I wash it?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's right.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's his.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Take it back first.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Can we take a photo, A'Kui?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Sure.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Who is holding the button?

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I know.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I know.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hold it here.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Then when you hear the sound of the button,

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
run over here.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Really?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What if it breaks?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Move aside.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let me do it.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Everyone, go over there.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Sit tight.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Look at the dates on these photos.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
1990,

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
1992,

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and 2002.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They should be the same batch.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Not only the same batch.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
According to the five-point direction,

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Liu Kui, Yang Dong,

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and Xue Hong Lai.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Who are these two?

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I've never seen them.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This one

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
should be Liu Hai Xiao.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The photos are too long.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This woman can't even see clearly.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
She is the mother

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
of these five people?

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Qi Chu,

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
can you draw this woman

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
as she is now?

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Lu Cai Bang.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lu Cai Bang.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Lu Cai Bang.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Lu Cai Bang of Tang Dynasty?

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Lu Cai Bang?

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There is a story

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
called The Thin Lung.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Have you heard of it?

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The bronze bone

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
in the story

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
is called Lu Cai Bang.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Those children

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
will be printed

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
on the seal

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
after they enter the black hole

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
of Tang Dynasty.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They call these children

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lu Cai Bang.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tang Qiang said

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to find some more people to go down the well.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Stop!

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where are they taking us?

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Down the well.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What?

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Last time,

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
we went into the mountain

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
with them.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We never came back.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, I...

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't go down the well.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't want to go back.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What are you doing?

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let me go back and take you back.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Watch her.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are you okay?

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm fine.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Run! Run! Run!

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Run! Run!

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hurry!

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Where did they go?

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Later...

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I heard that

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
they were

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
always

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
in a long-term fight.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Because they were

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
in charge,

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
they were

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
also

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
inattentive

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and became

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
a free hand

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that no one dared to mess with.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why didn't you come back?

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Where are you going?

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's lie down.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't make any noise.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
After you enter the room,

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you must control Tang Chen and the bodyguards.

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You must kneel down.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who will do it?

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Zhou Xiu.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Zhou Xiu.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Brother.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We're in trouble.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If we get the gold,

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
we'll have a good life.

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Tang Chen.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He was your guardian.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He was sentenced to five years in prison.

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He dared to use his copper bow.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
More than 20 years ago.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He was very lucky

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to stay in the factory.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If he was unlucky,

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
he would have been put into a mine

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and dug up a mine for Tang Chen.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Dig a well-mined mine.

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let the children dig the mines.

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What else can we do?

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The cave is just a little bit big.

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What about the kids?

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If the cave is not so dark,

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
can he make so much money?

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Of course.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm also

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
very simple.

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've never seen it with my own eyes.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're all right.

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's said that

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
eight years ago,

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
on a dark night,

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
two

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
firecrackers

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
ran into Tang Chen's house

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and cut off his neck.

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Tang Chen

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Tang Chen

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're so stupid.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can just say it directly.

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You took it away

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and ruined my cabinet.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Poor thing.

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You've never seen so many gold bars.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't take it too much.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's not worth it.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why are you so cruel to us?

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you know where we are?

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You can come and go as you want.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You'd better think it over.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you take these things

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
or not?

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm afraid you'll be killed

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and you'll die.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Tang Chen

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Eight years ago.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you sure you remember it?

179
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Tang Chen told me

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that he had a secret.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Listen.

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Tang Chen told me that

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
when he was tied up,

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
he could see clearly

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that there was a mark

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
under his neck.

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Didn't he call the police?

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Are you stupid?

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Did the gold bars

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
go to the police?

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Did Tang Chen call the police?

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If Tang Chen called the police,

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
would they go to get it?

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Black is black.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Black is black.

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You fools.

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You didn't know that.

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We knew it very well.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Tang Chen told us

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
that if we found the gold bars

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and killed the two thieves,

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
he could get the money.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What happened later?

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's easy to find

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
when you go to get it later.

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We want the money, too.

209
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We don't want the money.

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You haven't found it all the time?

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The man and the mirror.

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They're all gone.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There's no clue at all.

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There's no clue at all.

215
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's no clue.

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How many gold bars do you have?

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There must be 30 gold bars.

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
According to the price of the year,

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
3 million.

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Where's Yang Dong?

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Where's the horse?

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It seems that he hasn't got it yet.

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yang Dong should have been killed.

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The gold is gone.

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What should we do?

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Your little girlfriend died.

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
She was poisoned to death.

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What did you do?

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I sent you the message.

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Go back and ask the buyer.

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Wait for the goods.

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I haven't found the gold bars yet.

233
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Just for the gold bars?

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What about the people?

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Brother.

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're already a number on the police.

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You should leave first.

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And be careful when you pick up the goods.

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Don't be blown up again.

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm going to kill you.

241
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm going to kill you.

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I only told you that something bad happened.

243
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
How did you know it was a bomb?

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I...

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Wu.

246
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I only have you as a brother.

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You betrayed me too.

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Brother.

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Brother.

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Brother.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Brother.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It was a bomb.

253
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It was a bomb.

254
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It was a bomb.

255
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It was a bomb.

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It exploded immediately.

257
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Why?

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He said...

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He said my child...

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He didn't have a good family.

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Last time...

262
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
When I killed Brother San,

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
he said the same thing.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I...

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Brother.

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Brother.

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't fight with him.

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's for your own good.

269
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm sorry.

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry.
