Episode 18

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's go together.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll keep one more.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Two more.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wow, it's so big.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's so big.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's so big.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's said that your aunt called you five tigers.

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Five tigers.

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We also know about your brother.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Brother, we're in trouble.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
After we finish the work in Tang City,

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
we'll come back with gold.

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Uncle Jiang said

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
if I have gold,

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I can live a good life.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If I have gold,

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll be gone.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll be gone.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's all right.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You police

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
look for the truth all over the world.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Where's the truth?

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is the truth.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Where's the truth?

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,680
There's the truth.

32
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,440
The truth we found

33
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,640
is that you're all victims.

34
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
Give it to me after you're done.

35
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,840
Come on.

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,480
Let's go.

37
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,960
After you're done,

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,120
take it all.

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,080
Okay, I'm leaving.

40
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,720
I'm leaving.

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,160
Mom, look.

42
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
I found a bag.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a big pot.

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,920
I found a bag.

45
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,520
Okay, hang it up.

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
Hang it up.

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,360
Fly away.

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,760
Coming.

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,400
Come here.

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,840
I found a bag.

51
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,640
A bag.

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,640
A bag.

53
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,760
A bag.

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,000
A bag.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,760
A bag.

56
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,320
Do you want to eat it?

57
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,480
Of course.

58
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Who doesn't want to eat it?

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Do you have money?

60
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,080
No.

61
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,560
You can exchange it with something else.

62
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Really?

63
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,920
Here.

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,840
Here.

65
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:42,960
Here.

66
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,520
This one.

67
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,880
Exchange it with something else.

68
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,320
Here.

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,520
Here.

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,560
This one.

71
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,880
Exchange it with something else.

72
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,200
This one is too heavy.

73
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
This one.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,280
You can't exchange it with a bun.

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,280
Here.

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,960
Can I exchange anything with it?

77
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
Of course.

78
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,160
It's priceless.

79
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,040
I don't understand.

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,520
It means

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,160
as long as you have the guts,

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,760
there's nothing you can't exchange.

83
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,240
If you have nothing,

84
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,840
you can only starve.

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,560
Then,

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,480
do I have a home?

87
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,000
Everyone has a home.

88
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,680
I'm not a foodie.

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm a foodie.

90
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,440
You killed Yang Dong?

91
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,560
Yes.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,080
Brother Kai,

93
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,480
since you're going to die,

94
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,440
don't listen to them.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
Don't let them go.

96
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,880
Brother,

97
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,800
come on.

98
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,560
Do you want to die?

99
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,160
No, I don't.

100
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,280
Brother.

101
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,280
Leave now.

102
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,200
You killed Liu K Week too?

103
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,640
Yes.

104
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,200
Let's go.

105
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,480
Xu Honglei and Zhang Guiping

106
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,320
are also your targets.

107
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,080
If you delay for a few more minutes,

108
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,920
my plan will be successful.

109
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,240
If we delay for a few more minutes,

110
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,440
what about Gu?

111
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,440
Can you protect him?

112
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,960
She is my daughter.

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,680
Do you want your daughter to be like you?

114
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640
She is different from me.

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,040
She will have a lot of...

116
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,240
A lot...

117
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,560
You have a lot too.

118
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,800
Luo Haixiao.

119
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,440
You have a lot too.

120
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
Luo Haixiao.

121
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,080
Although you are orphans,

122
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,560
this is not an excuse for you to commit crimes.

123
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,080
You can see your daughter.

124
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,000
Why don't you cherish her?

125
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,720
Why?

126
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,320
Dad, dad, my big star is gone.

127
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,440
It must be because it ran away from home.

128
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,520
Dad, I'm sorry.

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,920
Dad, I'm sorry.

130
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,240
Dad, I'm sorry.

131
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,320
Dad, I'm sorry.

132
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Dad, I'm sorry.

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Dad, I'm sorry.

134
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Dad, I'm sorry.

135
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Dad, I'm sorry.

136
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,160
I'm so angry.

137
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Help me find it.

138
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,080
Mom.

139
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
It still hurts?

140
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,440
It will Mechanise soon.

141
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,560
I've done a lot of wrong things in my life.

143
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm a bad person.

144
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
You're different.

145
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,400
You have to be a good person.

146
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,920
Remember that.

147
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,200
Okay?

148
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,560
I'm going to sleep.

149
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
Go to sleep.

150
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,940
Day two

151
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,720
No.

152
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,420
You go alone.

153
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,260
I will take care of things.

154
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,260
This is too cold.

155
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,180
It's cold.

156
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,500
Foreigners are bowls.

157
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,380
A bowl?

158
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,740
Yeah, a bowl.

159
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,860
After you guys go to bed,

160
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,840
why are you sausages?

161
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,840
The unknown night flowers

162
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Remind me of the time when people were wandering

163
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,640
In the wind, loneliness is open

164
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,640
When the eyes are closed, the farthest place

165
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,640
I change a piece of grass

166
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,640
And stop here

167
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Is it a satisfaction

168
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Or another kind of happiness

169
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,640
I'm going to the end of the world

170
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,640
To continue my endless journey

171
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Is there freedom ahead

172
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,640
Or is it just a piece of broken bone

173
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,640
I cross the line

174
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,640
And cross the valley

175
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:58,640
I just started to recall the beginning of the beginning

176
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,640
I can't cry

177
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,640
I can't break through the scroll

178
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,640
I just know happiness can't be caught

179
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Can't be kept
