00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Qiqi.

3
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,000
What is this?

4
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sugar.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wrong.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What your father gave you is sugar.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What others gave you is poison.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
All the things you like are possible to be dangerous to you.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you understand?

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Good boy.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is this dangerous?

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is this dangerous?

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Is this dangerous?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What is dangerous?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is what my father used to blow your hair.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Only I can blow it, others can't.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's go home.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Do you still remember?

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The Child of the Year

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Episode 1

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This child is yours.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Did you see it?

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
In 2005,

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the children I brought

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
were all sent to Hongwu.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hongwu

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There is a man named Shan Chong.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Mr. Han.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What are you talking about?

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He likes to have a girl.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you talking about?

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The mountain of mountains.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's a long way.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I were you,

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I wouldn't look for it.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If I didn't look for it,

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I would have lost it.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Look.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The Child of the Year

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
All the children and women

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
were found by you.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No more talk.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Except for the crime of selling the population,

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and the fact that you took part in the crime,

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll tell you right away.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Liu Keying's car was sent by the woman.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I asked her to blow it.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The child was sent to Hongwu.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's so scary.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What are you doing?

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Look, what are you doing?

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What are you doing?

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why are you doing this?

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then,

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
my mother said she was the one who did it.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I told you something.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How did you know it was a bomb?

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I...

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I...

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
My brother...

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
was the one who blew it.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He blew it.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What?

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He blew it.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Then,

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
they were completely separated.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Liu Keying

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
was the one who told me to let him go to the prison.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He also had a grudge.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
had a problem.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't move!

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Put your weapon down!

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Liu Keying.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Liu Keying.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Liu Keying.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Calm down!

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Calm down!

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Luo Haixiao and Zhang Guiping

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
are all the cars you used to drive.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Right?

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's right.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mom!

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Mom!

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is your work desk.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Be careful.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay, okay.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't be afraid.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Go, go, go.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Zhang Guiping!

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Zhang Guiping!

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm here!

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You wanted them to kill each other.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You took away all the gold.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Right?

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They all have to die.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Do you understand?

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What kind of a person

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
loves you and your family?

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you understand?

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You've been with Zhang Guiping since you were a kid.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He's the most emotional for you.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're like them.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you hate him?

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What do you hate?

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you hate me?

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What are you laughing at?

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What are you laughing at?

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're a double-edged sword.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You don't know Zhang Guiping's taste.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm a genius.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A genius.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Is this the child you raised?

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Are you satisfied?

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm telling you, Zhang Guiping!

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I won't give up.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
All my parents won't give up!

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Bye-bye.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You're here.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm here.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm here to see you.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why?

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Bye-bye.

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's the one you just told me.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm here.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Stop!

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Stop!

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Stop!

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Stop!

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Stop!

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Stop!

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Stop!

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Stop!

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Stop!

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Stop!

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Stop!

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Stop!

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Stop!

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Stop!

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Stop!

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Be careful.

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Be careful.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Zhao Zhi is in the car.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Go and call him.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Zhao Zhi.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Zhao Zhi.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Zhao Zhi.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm going.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's go.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's go.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm going.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Lin Shen, don't forget your water.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, yes.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Put it here.

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's go to the meeting room.

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'll go.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't let the girl move.

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You can go.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Wait for me upstairs.

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Wait for me.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's go, Qi Yu.

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Wait for me.

175
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The red mushroom is falling off.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He's guilty.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I know.

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have to go.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You go alone?

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes.

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The special forces have disbanded.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You have a new mission.

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll do it myself.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay.

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No need to mention it.

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I promise to follow the instructions.

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll go.

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll go.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No need to mention it.

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I promise to follow the instructions.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
How are you?

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Have you made your wish come true?

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you feel like a hero?

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, Zhao Zhi.

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're still laughing at me?

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Xin He.

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
how to call it a hero.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But I know that

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
all we can do is continue.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't listen.

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We are the last line.

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay.

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I promise.

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Do your best

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and keep your promise.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Take care.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Xiaogua looks like you.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
She does not.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's funny.

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I do not think so.

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The other smile.

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We can take more.

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
More?

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Old brother,

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
how are you feeling now?

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I feel cool.

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Then smile more.

220
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,440
Master, these years...

221
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,880
I've never blamed you.

222
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Never.

223
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,280
I will find Qiqi.

224
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Trust me.

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
People say you are going to leave the village

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and leave the village.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We will miss your smile.

228
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Your eyes are brighter than the sun and the moon.

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So, in our hearts,

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,000
come and sit beside me.

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Don't leave this place.

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Don't leave this place.

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't leave this place.

234
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't leave this place.

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Thank you.

236
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The night flowers are like a steam.

237
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let people panic.

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In the wind, loneliness opens.

239
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
When the fog is gone, it's time to leave.

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I change my clothes.

241
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I stop here.

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm satisfied.

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm still a different kind of person.

244
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I walk in the息 of the cheek to continue the endless journey.

245
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Never give me parting to be free or separated from you.

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,960
No, that counts
