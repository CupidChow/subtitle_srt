Episode 18

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm wrong.

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm wrong.

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You're wrong.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm begging you.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Get up.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Taoism Grandmaster

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Dong Zhi, the result is out.

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Wang Ziyan?

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ma, your report.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Have you seen him?

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Isn't this Wang Ziyan?

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He used to work at our reception desk.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But he's not here now.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is there any personal item here?

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He won't come back to get it.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've put it in his office.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you know his family situation?

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He used to work at Taining.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
His parents are farmers.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I've never heard of any relatives here.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Manager Tai,

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
your business is good.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's good.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's been open for more than four years.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now there are more than 300 members

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and more than 20 coaches.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was on the photo wall just now.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why didn't I see Wang Ziyan?

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Those are all the photos of the coaches.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He's a salesman.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't worry.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Go upstairs and have a look.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Please.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Please come in.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
These are Wang Ziyan's things.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They're all here.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Manager Cai,

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
these are all Wang Ziyan's things.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes, I've never touched them.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
These are antiques

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
from the 70s.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They're worth 30,000 yuan.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
30,000 yuan?

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is it that expensive?

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You Jia Teng?

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Didn't you say his family's condition was bad?

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Where's the surveillance camera?

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have the file.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Sign Wang Ziyan's signature.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll go find it.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay. Signature, right?

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Signature.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Where is it?

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I didn't put the things there.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So...

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll go find the signature.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Where is it?

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I saw it.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What's that on the front?

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's the time of our private lesson.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's written

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that he'll be working at 10 a.m. on May 5th.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why isn't he off work?

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
he's not off work.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't think

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sure.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There's no Wang Ziyan leaving the gym

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
on the night of May 5th.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Take the picture of him working.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I got it.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Look at his body.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He looks like a woman.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Zoom in.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He looks like a woman.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
See if there's anything else

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
that needs to be done.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You can come over anytime.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hello?

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hello?

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hello?

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hello?

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Mr. Chen, it's me, Xiao Cai.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The police just came

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to ask about Wang Ziyan.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Zhao Zhi, I got it.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The owner's name is Dai Qian.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He's married.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's the CEO of Yi Yang Foreign Trade Company.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
His name is Chen Zhengwei.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The police have already

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
sent you the phone number.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I got it.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Have you seen this?

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I bought it before.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then?

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I sent someone.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Who?

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
A friend.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Which friend?

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wang Ziyan.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's your relationship

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
with Wang Ziyan?

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We're in a relationship.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
When was the last time you saw him?

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I went to work

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
on the morning of the 5th.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Where were you on the night of the 5th?

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What were you doing?

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was sick that day.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I went home early to rest.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was at home all the time.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Who can prove it to you?

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
My nanny.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Auntie Zheng.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Auntie Zheng, come here.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm asking you.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Auntie.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Where were you on the night of the 5th?

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What were you doing?

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you miss me?

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I definitely miss you.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I can't see it.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't ignore me.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was so tired that day.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I was so hot at home.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll get you a blanket.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Auntie.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Go.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm not going to film you.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you have anything else to ask?

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Almost.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We'll contact you

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
if there's any questions.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's all.

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's go.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll ask you one more question.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Does your husband know

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
your relationship with Wang Ziyan?

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Why are you back?

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Are you going to hit me?

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Tell me.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Are you going to kill me?

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I know.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I know that.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Just tell me directly.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Did something happen to Yan Yan?

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Wang Ziyan is dead.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What happened to her?

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Stop drinking.

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let go.

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Stop drinking.

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let go.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The number you have dialed is power off.

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Please redial later.

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The number you have dialed is power off.

178
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Please redial later.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The number you have dialed is power off.

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Please redial later.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The number you have dialed is power off.

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Please redial later.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No need to answer.

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Xiao Zhi, Dai Qian's husband ran away.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The surveillance camera is on Chen Zhenwei.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He left the company alone at 3 o'clock this afternoon.

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He went to Jiangbai High School.

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He went to Tanning Harbor.

189
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Call the nearby comrades immediately.

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We are going to search the target at the dock.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Tanning Harbor, please gather at the dock.

192
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Tanning Harbor, please gather at the dock.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
How is it?

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Here. The boss of this water purifier is Chen Zhenwei's friend.

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There is a short-cut road ahead.

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We have to find a way.

197
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It should be there.

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It hasn't rained for two days.

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The water level is low there. Only this boat can be opened.

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Guzi, start the boat.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Start the boat.

202
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Guzi, start the boat.

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You want to die?

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hurry up.

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Start the boat. You are deaf.

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Chen Zhenwei.

207
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Who are you?

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let me go.

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let me go.

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Wait.

211
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Stop.

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Stop.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You are good at it.

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I can join our special security team.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You want to join the special security team?

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You are a hero.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I will consider it.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay. It's settled.

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's settled.

220
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't understand.

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How did you read it?

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I will go to Tanning Harbor.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I am asking you.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You think we are watching you?

225
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We don't know the people around you.

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Guzi.

227
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We found Wang Ziyan's DNA

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
in the water.

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Tell me. Why did you kill him?

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What?

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Wang Ziyan died?

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Wait.

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You mean I killed Wang Ziyan?

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Or what?

235
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Officer, you can't say that.

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I hate him. I beat him up.

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But I didn't kill him.

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Tell me the truth.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You caught me and ran away.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And?

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I spent money to find someone.

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I found a white face with a letter.

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Mr. Chen.

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What you want.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Thank you.

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Then

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I took someone

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
from the back door of the ward.

249
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What are you doing?

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Guzi.

251
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Guzi.

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
A tombstone?

253
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How is it possible?

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Brothers.

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Officer.

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I hate him.

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But I didn't do it so harshly.

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I beat him up.

259
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll die.

260
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Just one?

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Just one.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm wrong.

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm wrong.

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Wrong.

265
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm begging you.

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Then?

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Tell me.

268
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Then

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I shouldn't have been upset.

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I left the car behind.

271
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I found a village in the dark.

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I left it there.

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I beg you to let me go.

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I beg you to let me go.

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If you don't want to die,

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
just get out of Taining.

277
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't let him see you.

278
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I beg you to let me go.

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Which village?

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
This one.

281
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I left it here when I left.

282
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Here?

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes, here.

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Here.

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Zhao Zhi,

286
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
there's no charcoal here.

287
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No,

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
he moved when I left.

289
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He sat up.

290
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Officer, I really didn't kill him.

291
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Take him back.

292
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Officer, really.

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Zhao Zhi, I saw it.

294
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
From this road,

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the second intersection,

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
about 300 meters,

297
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
is the owner's house.

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If Chen Zhengwei

299
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
tells the truth,

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
it means

301
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Wang Ziyan

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
was here

303
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and was thrown into the car.

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Then he met the real murderer.

305
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Help me.

306
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

323
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I should

336
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
stop here

337
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
with a piece of grass.

338
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Is it

339
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
satisfaction

340
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
or another kind of

341
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
success?

342
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm going

343
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
into the mouth

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and continue

345
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
the endless journey.

346
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Is there

347
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
freedom

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
or separation

349
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
between the two?

350
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I've crossed

351
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the two rivers

352
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and walked

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
through the valley

354
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and started to miss

355
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
the valley

356
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
when I set off.

357
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I've cried

358
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and cried

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and read

360
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
through the books

361
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
until I know

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
happiness

363
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and happiness.
