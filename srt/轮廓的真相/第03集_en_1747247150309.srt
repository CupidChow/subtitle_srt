00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 18

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Taoism Grandmaster

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Since Yang Dong was released,

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
he rarely had any contact with the villagers.

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That day, his family suddenly caught on fire.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When the villagers arrived,

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
all the houses and people were gone.

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He died so soon?

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He didn't have any relatives or friends.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The villagers, according to the customs,

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
buried him.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's it.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How did you confirm his identity?

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He was the only one in the house.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Judging from his body shape, it was him.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's lift him up.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We can lift him up. Come on.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Did Yang Dong have a record

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
of his height and weight

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
in the last investigation before he was born?

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He should have.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But maybe it was too early.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll go back and check.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've seen the coffin.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why aren't you here yet?

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Open it.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A-Yin.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is the latest

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
investigation in the village.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Come on.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's go.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's go.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's go.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you doing?

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The special investigation team is here.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's the big deal?

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What do you mean?

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Well...

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Isn't Zhou Fa Yi here too?

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're trying to make a fuss?

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You said you wanted to cooperate.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I've even dug a grave.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're even putting glue on it.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Look at yourself.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Go take a shower.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Go.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Go.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Go.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Go.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The victim is a man.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There are some wrong injuries on the right hip joint.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The left arm was broken.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He must have been beaten up before he died.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There are some blunt wounds on the collarbone.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But the wound

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
doesn't have a life-reaction after the injury.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And there are no smoke

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
in the mouth, nose, and air duct.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There's no smoke.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So the victim was beaten up first

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and then killed.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Look.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The blunt wound on the back of the head

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
must be the cause of his death.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What else did you see?

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The victim's age

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
should be between 18 and 25 years old.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Wait.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The age should be between 18 and 25 years old.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Gu Lin wouldn't die.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Call the police.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yang Dong is already 32 years old.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The victim's age

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is between 18 and 25 years old.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The victim's age

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
is between 18 and 25 years old.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The victim's age

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
is between 18 and 25 years old.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yang Dong is already 32 years old.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The victim is not him.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Where is Yang Dong?

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Find him as soon as possible.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Qi Chu.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Qi Chu.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're the head of the team.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're also from the hard-core team.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I knocked you down

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
three times last night.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Your skills

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
are not that good, are they?

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm here to solve the case.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm not here to fight.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Why do you think

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
they want you?

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm here to help them.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm here to help them.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why do you think

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
they want you?

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
All right.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Stop looking at me.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I know I'm handsome.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you know that I was a fat guy

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
when I was in the first grade?

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
A big fat guy.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
How do you know?

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm a painter.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The most urgent thing now

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is to find out the identity of the victim as soon as possible.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The DNA collected now

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
is not compatible with the database.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The residents of the community

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
have not reported missing persons.

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I want to apply

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to be a re-appointed member of the Lu Group.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Only Sheng Tian has this technology.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I've asked.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It takes at least a month.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Not a month.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's too long.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why are you looking at him?

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let him sit down.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I've never seen a girl

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
be so stubborn.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Maybe he has a way.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How about

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
you let him try it?

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let me think about it.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The captain Zhao Zhi

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
is quite a temper.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I heard that

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
a painter can make people

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
look old and small.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Can you still

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
deduce that you're a fat guy?

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I heard from Zhang Liang.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How about we have a competition?

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What?

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Who can enter the special case group first?

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're going to lose.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's a draw.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's a draw.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What era is it?

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're still painting.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Zhang Liang.

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's get to work.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you doing?

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Zhao Zhi, you've worked hard.

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's have a meal.

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What meal?

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The ribs I made myself.

160
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's still hot.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's eat and talk.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I just finished reading the autopsy report.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Eat some fruit.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's talk.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's make a deal.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You've always wanted to

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
be a logistics man.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll help you.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And then?

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll enter the special case group.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You didn't do anything else before.

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You always stare at me.

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm not staring at you.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm just looking at you.

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You said we're doing this job.

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Who doesn't want to crack a big case

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and make a big contribution?

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The case is not a big deal.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But the ability is a big deal.

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Anyway, just believe me.

181
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I promise to complete the task.

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
How to prove it?

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll give you a big gift now.

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's go.

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No.

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Please.

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Please.

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What are you doing?

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Playing games.

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What are you doing?

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm just playing.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Playing games?

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is this the look of a dead person

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
who imitates the appearance of a woman?

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I didn't sleep well and had a bad dream.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm so stupid.

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm in the stomach.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll be right there.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Right now.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What's up?

201
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay, okay, forget it.

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're pretty good.

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm happy now.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, no, no.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Thanks.

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Liang Zi is at this level.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I have no choice.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Mr. Xiang.

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I have a way.

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How did you get in?

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I said I have a way.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And it's the only way.

213
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You have no choice.

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What do you mean?

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can recreate the look of a dead person.

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Your photos are here.

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I suddenly remembered an emergency.

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You guys go ahead.

219
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hello? Hello? Hello?

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
How long does it take to record the reproduction?

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If we start right now,

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
five days.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Three days.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Make sure to complete the task.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No.

226
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The victim is a man.

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The right ankle joint has a wrong wound.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The left cheekbone is broken.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He must have been beaten up before.

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There are blunt wounds in the left hip.

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But the wound has no life reaction after the injury.

232
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And the mouth, nose, throat, and air ducts are not polluted.

233
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The blunt wound behind the brain

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
should be the cause of his death.

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The victim was beaten up first

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and then cut to pieces.

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And then he was torn apart.

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The age of the victim should be

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
between 18 and 25 years old.

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Zhao Zhi, the painting is ready.

241
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's still a child.

242
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Xiaoyu.

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's go and compare.

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay.

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Master.

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I re-painted it again.

248
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No.

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You have to understand what the witness said first.

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then compare.

251
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Go on.

252
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
How is it?

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Almost.

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Zhao Zhi.

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Zhao Zhi.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The comparison result is out.

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Wang Ziyan.

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The painting is ready.

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
