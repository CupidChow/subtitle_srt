1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Dad, hurry up.

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're late.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We're late.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Dad, come here.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well,

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the show is at 3.30.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's on the first floor of the first floor of the youth palace.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't forget.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There's water in the bag.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Dad, your hair is so ugly.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Dad, it's too late.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let Chu Chu tell you.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm talking about your hair.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Dad, I'm leaving.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Have a good show.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
When you come back,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll be your only audience.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Watch it again, okay?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's go.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Li Da Jun is going to show his face.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm running late.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't worry.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Be careful.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Say goodbye to dad.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Bye.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Bye.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Good boy.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How's your brother doing?

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sing it for me.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How about the dance?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Bai.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
People say you should leave the village

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We miss your smile

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Your eyes are brighter than the sun

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Did you buy ice cream for him again?

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Of course.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How can I write without buying homework?

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Qi Qi.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Qi Qi.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Qi Qi.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Qi Qi.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's up?

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We should take Wu Shou Wei to the crime scene.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's go.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wu Shou Wei.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I knocked on the door when he came in.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I found the wrong door.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I found a can of gas and turned the power on.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I just hit the door.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's it.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How long have you been following Yang Dong?

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
More than a month.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Where did he go and whom did he meet before?

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Wu Shou Wei.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You'd better tell us everything you know.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If you try to make a contribution, the court will reconsider your sentence.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm telling you, it's not going to work.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm asking you again.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How much do you know about Yang Dong?

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Is there any secret behind him?

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can't tell you.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wu Shou Wei.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Not only did you lose your child,

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
but many other children are waiting to be saved.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You don't say it even if you know.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you have a conscience?

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Conscience?

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do you have a conscience?

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Conscience?

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can get anything if I can get my son back.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can't get him back.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It doesn't matter to me whether you die or not.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It has nothing to do with you.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It has nothing to do with you.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Calm down.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It has nothing to do with you.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Calm down.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let me go.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't touch me.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What's wrong with him today?

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's been acting weird since he got up this morning.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I think you're acting weird too.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you know how long it took us to find this guy?

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How long?

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Five years.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In 2006,

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
we found out Liu Kui's name.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
In 2007,

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we found out his business abroad.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Until last year,

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
we found out he was a street vendor in China.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You said you wanted to be a hero in the case team.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think you should be mentally prepared.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Here,

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
your dream won't come true so easily.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll send you to the police station.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Zhao Zhi,

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
send him to the police station.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He won't say anything if he sees this.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Think about other options.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Got it.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm hanging up.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm driving.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's talk.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's talk.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I've seen someone who's even worse than you.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Old Boss died on the operating table.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
His dean was killed.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He's been in the hospital for a long time.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He's been in the hospital for a long time.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
His dean's family was killed.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The police couldn't even see that scene.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He also had a 14-year-old son.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He just got into the first class.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Did he get caught?

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He was chased for three months.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He was killed.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
On the day he was caught,

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the police caught his daughter.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Li Da Jun is missing.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm running late.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't worry.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Take care.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Say bye to your dad.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Bye.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Bye.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Did you learn it?

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Did you buy the ticket?

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You can protect the police,

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but you can't protect your own family.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ridiculous.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ridiculous?

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Who's not ridiculous?

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
100 people are ridiculous.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Your son is more than a decade old.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Just like Qiqi.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Did you have a nightmare?

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Did you dream that when the child was taken away,

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
he was scared?

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Did you dream that when you were not by his side,

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
he was hurt?

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Did he hurt?

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Was he hungry?

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Did he cry?

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Have you ever thought about it?

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you were there that day,

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the child would not be lost.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Have you ever thought about it?

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Every day we live,

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
we suffer.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You suffer a lot when you live.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Even if you kill Yang Dong,

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
can you be free?

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I know a lot.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Guards.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The police are about to open the interrogation room.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hurry.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Zhao Zhi.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What's wrong?

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's okay.

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What's wrong?

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's really okay.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Wake up.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You mean the old room in the wine factory on the morning of the 6th?

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I saw the cold building.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No. 6.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's No. 6.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I was so stupid to kill him that day.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Anyway,

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
there's a man in the house.

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Since you're out,

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
why don't you go home?

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mom has been looking for you.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I have a home now.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Is it him?

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't know.

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I didn't go in and didn't see anyone.

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What did they say?

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's just that

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
this man is looking for Yang Dong.

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He wants something.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If you don't want to make trouble, just hand over the thing.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Hand over it and you'll be fine.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
From childhood to now,

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I've been the one who killed everyone.

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think it's my man.

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yang Dong didn't give it to me.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They just did it.

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What exactly?

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
They didn't say what exactly.

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I think this thing is important

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
because they did it

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
so hard.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Then Yang Dong ran out.

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm black.

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll go up when I get it.

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I saw a little girl come out.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Girl?

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Where did you see her?

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I saw her in the bathroom.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Girl?

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
How old is she?

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Seven or eight years old.

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, seven or eight years old.

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I saw a child here.

219
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Forget it. I know where her house is.

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll wait for her at her house.

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You'll know later.

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes, that's it.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Are you sure you only know this?

224
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I want to find Yang Dong more than you do.

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I know.

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We'll check what you said.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have something to ask you.

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Go ahead.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Did you find your child?

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Not yet.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Maybe soon.

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Maybe...

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you found her, please send me a message.

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll send it to you.

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll send it to you.

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll send it to you.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'll send it to you.

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You can send it to me.

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you.

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you.

242
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Thank you.

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What do you want to ask?

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Is it Liu Kui?

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The person who kidnapped Qiqi?

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's a boy.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He was only ten years old.

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He was the one who lured Qiqi away.

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The boy was later found by the police.

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He was the one who kidnapped her.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,340
He was a

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I was the one who took Qiqi out that day.

253
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
We're running out of time.

254
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's go.

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We're running out of time.

256
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We're running out of time.

257
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Qiqi.

258
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Qiqi.

259
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Qiqi.

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We're not playing hide-and-seek anymore, Qiqi.

261
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We're running out of time, Qiqi.

262
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm here.

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Come on.

264
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Stop running.

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Qiqi.

266
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Qiqi.

267
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Qiqi.

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Come here.

269
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We're not playing hide-and-seek anymore.

270
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We're running out of time.

271
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Come on.

272
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Come on.

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Hello.

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, I'm here.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay, I understand.

276
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you.

277
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't help but smile

278
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Your eyes are brighter than the sun

279
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Sister.

280
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I can't help but smile

281
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're the one who took me away

282
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If...

283
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If I were to come back again,

284
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
would you still chase after the murderer that day?

285
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes.

286
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can't help but smile

287
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I face the sky and the sun

288
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
My tired feet crumple the morning dew

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The nameless night flowers remind me of the dust

290
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm wandering in the wind

291
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Loneliness is opening up

292
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I look farthest

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I take a piece of grass

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and stop here

295
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Is it enough to be satisfied

296
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
or another kind of progress?

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm going into the gorge

298
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
to continue my endless journey

299
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Is there freedom ahead

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
or a broken heart?

301
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I cross the two rivers

302
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and cross the valley

303
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I just started to recall

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
the mountain valley I set out on

305
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I can't stop my tears

306
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,140
I can't break my own

307
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,000
I just realized that happiness can't be grasped or stopped
