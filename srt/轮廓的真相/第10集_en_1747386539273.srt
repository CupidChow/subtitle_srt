Episode 18

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,440
Mr. Yang, have you recovered the data?

7
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,800
Lin Shen said it would take about an hour.

8
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,020
Hello?

9
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
Hello?

10
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,920
Puppy!

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,480
You're too stubborn. You're relying on others.

12
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,040
Don't touch me.

13
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,240
Is this what you want?

14
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,600
Yes.

15
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,560
Are you leaving or not?

16
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,080
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,960
This is the list of guests

18
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
and all the guests who arrived on the spot.

19
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,880
You two will be in a group.

20
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,840
Each of you will be here for one night.

21
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,400
In 24 hours,

22
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,480
you will be able to

23
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,240
take off all the clothes.

24
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,200
Aining University.

25
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
Li Gong Academy.

26
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,480
All the waiters are college students.

27
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,760
Did you check the phone number yesterday?

28
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,600
Qingmen District.

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,160
Then start from the people who live in Qingmen District.

30
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,600
There are about 20 to 30 people in Qingmen District.

31
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,240
There are really six girls.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,480
We're just doing the work of the sea fishing.

33
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,080
How can we catch them if we don't catch them?

34
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,480
What if we don't catch them?

35
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,080
If you can't catch them,

36
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,320
then you can take off all the people

37
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,280
who have been there

38
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,480
for three, five, or even ten years

39
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,400
and passed by them.

40
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,480
What?

41
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,920
Move it.

42
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,120
Get to work.

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,120
Come on.

44
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,320
Which one?

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,320
This person?

46
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,960
No.

47
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,120
Four years ago, you might have been to a party.

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,760
Have you seen this person?

49
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,200
No.

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,840
No.

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,120
Thank you.

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,760
You're welcome.

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,200
Kowtow?

54
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm finally here.

55
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,660

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,040

bro

63
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,860
I didn't think much about it before.

64
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,940
But,

65
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,980
when you were with me,

66
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,520
I still 맛있어요

67
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,420
because you were being nice andflowy.

68
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,180
You haven't been a friend yet?

69
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,060
It's because your fandom

70
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:48,140
Come here.

71
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,100
Then why are you here again?

72
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,540
I'm done.

73
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,860
Fine.

74
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,020
This way!

75
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,780
That girl over there!

76
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,740
Stop running!

77
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,740
慢慢 Vilain 。」

78
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,860
May I help you?

79
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:13,900
I can't..

80
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,820
Where are you going?

81
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,020
Apply acupressure and face treatment.

82
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,780
Hey!

83
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,180
You let him dr Bless edges!

84
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,860
Matricido …

85
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,900
What?

86
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,340
Hey!

87
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,060
Hey!

88
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,740
I said Patience!

89
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,180
Do not run.

90
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,220
Jump, jump, jump.

91
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,860
Just jump if you want.

92
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,540
Get out of the way!

93
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,980
Run!

94
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,780
What are you doing? Who are you?

95
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,220
He didn't see that person.

96
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,740
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,220
Okay, thank you.

98
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,860
Lin Shen is checking the surveillance nearby.

99
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,660
If there's any news,

100
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,780
he'll inform me immediately.

101
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,540
If that person is Liu Kui,

102
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,140
he might be hiding here.

103
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,500
Yao La.

104
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,900
Yao La.

105
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,340
Is he not here?

106
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,220
Help me.

107
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,900
Help me.

108
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,100
Help me.

109
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,100
Help me.

110
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,500
Come on.

111
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,540
Zhao Zhi.

112
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,100
What's going on?

113
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,260
I think he was poisoned at first.

114
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,180
There were burps and sputum inside.

115
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,940
When we came here,

116
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,060
he was unconscious.

117
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,340
His body shrank.

118
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,420
His symptoms were very painful.

119
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,580
Here.

120
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,500
When we came here,

121
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,860
the door was open.

122
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,740
The door was closed well.

123
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,460
There are no signs of being deliberately destroyed.

124
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,820
Zhao Zhi.

125
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,180
Where are the valuable items?

126
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,660
None of them were found.

127
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,540
I don't know if the money on the ground

128
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,220
belonged to the murderer or two girls.

129
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,980
Where's the poison?

130
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,060
I'm checking it now.

131
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,380
But I just smelled

132
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,900
a little bit of bitter human smell in the bathroom.

133
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Pestilence?

134
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,460
I can't tell for sure.

135
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,500
I need to wait for the results of the night reading.

136
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,580
Zhou Fa Yi.

137
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,780
Please check this knife.

138
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,300
Okay.

139
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,460
You have a problem?

140
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,700
On the way here,

141
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,580
we met a man who looked like Liu Kui.

142
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,780
And then?

143
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,300
We followed three streets.

144
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,980
But we lost him.

145
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,500
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,300
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,100
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,820
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,580
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,340
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,180
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:53,820
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,580
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,380
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,780
I know.

157
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,380
Zhou Fei.

158
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,940
Mr. Zhao.

159
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,180
What?

160
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,340
You've finished the pursue test in Liao Lan's room.

161
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,380
You're really familiar with Liu Kui.

162
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,820
She ran away again.

163
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,580
Hello?

164
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,140
Su Wang.

165
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,900
The first night poem starts now.

166
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,740
The poem is dark red.

167
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,380
It's on the back,

168
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,340
on the chest,

169
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,340
and on the back of the limbs.

170
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,780
The upper right eye is the outside of the mucous membrane.

171
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,020
It's bleeding.

172
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,380
The lower right eye is the meridian of the meridians.

173
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,740
Pretend to be a baby.

174
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,020
The mouth...

175
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,100
Wait.

176
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,820
What's wrong with the mouth?

177
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,220
Let me see.

178
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,700
There's a white bubble in the mouth.

179
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,060
It's a blood clot.

180
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,660
It's a death-rejected tumor.

181
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,660
I need to check the internal organs.

182
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,700
If there are large amounts of bacteria in the lungs,

183
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,100
it means the cause of death

184
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,980
is not poisoning,

185
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,820
but a kidney failure.

186
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,220
So it may be that it was poisoned first,

187
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,420
and then it was rejuvenated.

188
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,780
But we were chasing Liu Kui

189
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,940
when the poison was coming out.

190
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,420
It's impossible for it to come back

191
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
and kill it.

192
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,940
Then what is the purpose of the poison?

193
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,340
The blame should have been made say for them,

194
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,500
or not,

195
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,780
or put bad on assistive complex.

196
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,380
I have known the reason since my childhood.

197
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,860
A snake knows that everything we gave away

198
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,080
is opened to trade when there's no iki.

199
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,220
However,

200
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,000
what if soured

201
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,220
has formed an avoidable reflection and the rejuvenation happen?

202
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,140
Yao Lan is 25 years old.

203
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,700
Ning Rui Rui is 23 years old.

204
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,220
They are two researching students

205
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,740
Yes.

206
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,700
Officer Gu.

207
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,100
You're already a captain at your age?

208
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,300
Yes.

209
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,860
Are you married?

210
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,620
Is everything okay at home?

211
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,460
Yes.

212
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,700
Let's get down to business.

213
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,540
Sit inside.

214
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,940
I like to stand outside.

215
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,740
That's good.

216
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,700
Officer Gu,

217
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,540
here's the thing.

218
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,380
Our neighborhood

219
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,860
is a small town.

220
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,580
We don't have surveillance cameras.

221
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,220
So we usually

222
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,180
monitor each other

223
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,220
in the forest.

224
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,660
This is the social relationship

225
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,620
we've organized

226
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,020
in the remote areas

227
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,900
in the committee.

228
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,220
Auntie, this is a detailed work.

229
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,540
It's more detailed than what we've done.

230
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,980
There are also the living quarters and the division.

231
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,860
It's the power of the masses.

232
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,380
We can ask anything

233
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,940
that the police can't find.

234
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,980
Yes.

235
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,780
We can unite the masses

236
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,740
by relying on them.

237
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,220
Right?

238
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,220
They're very close.

239
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,260
It's the secret

240
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,940
that you young people talk about.

241
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,540
The secret of a family.

242
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,940
Yes.

243
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,860
That's the secret.

244
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,220
They grew up together.

245
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,820
They lived together

246
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,860
from middle school to graduate school.

247
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,980
What about Wu Cong?

248
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,860
What's their relationship?

249
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,060
The handsome young man you mentioned?

250
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,580
Yes.

251
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,780
I don't know about that.

252
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,100
It's just...

253
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,700
What's wrong?

254
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,220
It's the day of the accident.

255
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,340
I saw him standing downstairs

256
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,620
for a long time before he went up.

257
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,420
He stood for a long time.

258
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,620
Anything else?

259
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,140
That's all for now.

260
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,260
Let's talk about it

261
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,020
after I finish this research.

262
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,660
Zhao Zhi.

263
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,780
I visited Wu Cong's school.

264
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,940
They all said that Wu Cong

265
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,980
only wrote papers about experiments.

266
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,460
He had no hobbies or friends.

267
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,540
He had no interactions with Yao Lan and Ning Rui Rui.

268
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,460
But why did he

269
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,700
show up at their house that day?

270
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,820
Everyone was surprised.

271
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,500
Look at this article.

272
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,060
In the waste water,

273
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,620
the hydrogen peroxide was extracted

274
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,580
to improve the research.

275
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,900
Writer Wu Cong.

276
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,220
Is this for real?

277
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,060
Yes.

278
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,980
I found the paper in my fulfilling

279
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,260
of our obstacles.

280
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,980
The papers are in contention.

281
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,980
Now,

282
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,260
did you think that

283
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,140
everything was written

284
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,260
about dessert?

285
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,860
No.

286
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,300
We just want to know the situation.

287
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,660
Please sit.

288
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,060
Do you have any impression of this magazine?

289
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,900
Your son is very good.

290
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,540
He published a paper on it.

291
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,500
And he got a fake one.

292
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,620
He's studying the hydrogen peroxide.

293
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,340
What do you mean?

294
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,500
You suspect my son of poisoning?

295
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,580
I'm just asking.

296
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,700
He's still in a coma.

297
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,420
You suspect him of poisoning?

298
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,140
This is your evidence.

299
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,300
Is this what you police think?

300
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,220
My son is a victim.

301
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,540
Victim!

302
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,220
He's not a murderer!

303
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,660
Sister, don't be angry.

304
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,180
We're just normal people.

305
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,100
I have nothing to say to you.

306
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,260
It's all my fault.

307
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,100
It's all my fault.

308
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,260
Wucong is awake.

309
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,620
Let's go.

310
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,900
Ceng Ceng, say something.

311
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,300
Don't scare me.

312
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,420
Wucong.

313
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,100
Do you remember

314
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,380
what happened that day?

315
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,660
Why did you go to Yao Lan

316
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
and Ning Rui Rui's house?

317
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,260
What's your relationship?

318
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,980
What else could it be?

319
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,260
My son went to find his girlfriend.

320
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,180
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
I'm sorry.

327
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
I'm sorry.

329
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,140
I'm sorry.

330
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,460
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,620
I'm sorry.

333
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,780
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,940
I'm sorry.

335
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I'm sorry.

336
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
I'm sorry.

338
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,580
I'm sorry.

339
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,740
I'm sorry.

340
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,900
I'm sorry.

341
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,380
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,540
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,540
I'm sorry.

346
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
I'm sorry.

347
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm sorry.

352
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
I'm sorry.

353
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
I'm sorry.

355
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,140
I'm sorry.

356
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
I'm sorry.

358
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
I'm sorry.

359
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
I'm sorry.

360
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
I'm sorry.

361
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
I'm sorry.

362
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,260
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,420
I'm sorry.

364
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
I'm sorry.

365
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
I'm sorry.

366
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm sorry.

367
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
I'm sorry.

368
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,220
I'm sorry.

369
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,380
I'm sorry.

370
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
I'm sorry.

371
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,580
I'm sorry.

372
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
I'm sorry.

373
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
I'm sorry.

375
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,380
I'm sorry.

377
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
I'm sorry.

378
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
I'm sorry.

381
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,180
I'm sorry.

382
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,340
I'm sorry.

383
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
I'm sorry.

385
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
I'm sorry.

386
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,980
