Episode 18

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I...

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I won a prize last night.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So I...

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yao Lan.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Brother.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I won a prize last night.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, I'll treat you to a meal tonight.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, I'll treat you to a meal.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Brother, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've been very busy lately.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Wait.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Help me hold this.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, I think this brand is quite popular lately.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll buy it for you.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No need.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They have a lot of products.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Taoism Grandmaster

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Master, look at this.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There are 25g of氫化鉀 and 25g of氫化鈉 in the lab.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's a lot.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wu Congqing has used 5 times in total in the past three months.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's almost 3g.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How much is the amount of the hydrogen peroxide?

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
0.02g.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He used too much.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Taoism Grandmaster

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Congcong has changed for that girl.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You mean, Wu Cong and Yao Lan are dating?

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Where did you get it?

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You touched something.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Money?

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where did you get it?

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm asking you.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I earned it.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
10,000 yuan?

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're a student.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where did you earn it?

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If it was a serious matter,

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
could you have kept it from us?

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Say something!

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't bother me.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Say something!

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't bother me.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Come back!

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What is it?

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yao Lan asked you to buy it, right?

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It has nothing to do with you.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Give it to me!

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you did something wrong for that kind of woman,

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
you're destroying this family!

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Which kind of woman?

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Which kind of woman is Yao Lan?

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yao Lan is my girlfriend!

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't say that, okay?

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm your mother!

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What can't I say?

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She's a scoundrel!

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're my mother.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yao Lan!

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She's my girlfriend!

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She's my girlfriend!

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm also a scoundrel!

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Beat me to death!

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You!

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What are you doing?

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm...

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wu Cong, what are you doing?

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Beat me to death!

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you doing, Wu Cong?

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Beat me to death!

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What are you doing?

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Beat me to death!

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What are you doing?

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't want to live, Yao Lan!

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What are you doing?

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't want to live!

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Children are like that.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The more you object,

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the more he insists.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I pushed him to Yao Lan.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If I followed him,

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
he wouldn't have gone to find Yao Lan.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Maybe it wouldn't have happened.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's all my fault.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's my fault.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why do you have a chance to go to school?

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wu Cong stole the poisonous test of the school.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's illegal.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Now is your only chance to save your son.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Tell me.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What did Wu Cong take away?

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:18,080
It's a

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm afraid you'll find out.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I swear,

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I didn't do it.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I just want to make more money

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and let Yao Lan like me.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I did it

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
for Yao Lan.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I...

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I wouldn't have broken the law

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
if it wasn't for Yao Lan.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No one forced you to break the law.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How can I blame Yao Lan

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
for my own mistakes?

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I...

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You know your mom

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
broke the law

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to protect you.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
She said she blamed you for

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
breaking the law.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She said she blamed you?

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I...

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is Wu Cong's account.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
These messages should be in Chinese.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Can we find the place

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
where he is chatting?

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The IP is outside the city.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It must be encrypted.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It takes some time to break the law.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let me know if you have any news.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I understand.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I suspect the buyer

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
is related to the population.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How are you?

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The letters of the committee

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
are like a novel.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I've sorted them out.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Look.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yao Lan.

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
She is lively and cute.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
She is polite to her parents.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Her parents are locals.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
She is retired from the state.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
She doesn't owe money.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What's interesting is this.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ning Rui Rui.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She is shy and shy.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Her mother remarried when she was three years old.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
She had a younger brother.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Her brother is twenty years old.

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
She often comes to ask for money from him.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
She always fights with him.

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It has a very bad influence.

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What's his name?

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Guo Long.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ko ни An.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Ko ni An.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Relax.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Rolling.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Running.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you scared of the�

160
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
sections.

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Are you saying

162
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,000
you like this kind of thing?

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You mean

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,140
攆

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,760
Wait for me.

166
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,040
His name is Guo Long.

167
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,640
He's a rich man.

168
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,840
He's a regular customer.

169
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,720
He's always busy.

170
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
In his shop,

171
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,760
he's the regular customer

172
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
who fights every other day.

173
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,200
Why isn't he here?

174
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
According to the factory,

175
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
he should be here during the day.

176
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,840
Do you know where he lives?

177
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,080
Who are you looking for?

178
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,920
The police.

179
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,200
Do you know Guo Long?

180
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,120
Yes. He's my friend.

181
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,080
Where does he live?

182
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,240
In my house.

183
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,200
I'm his landlord.

184
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,000
Is it convenient?

185
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,600
Guo Long.

186
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,440
Police. Open the door.

187
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,760
Guo Long.

188
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
We're the police.

189
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,760
Come out and ask us some questions.

190
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,560
Guo Long.

191
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,760
Guo Long.

192
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,920
Guo Long.

193
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,440
Where is Guo Long?

194
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,600
I don't know.

195
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,720
Where is he?

196
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't know either.

197
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Don't run.

198
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,000
Stop.

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,600
Stop.

200
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Stop.

201
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,200
Guo Long, stop.

202
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,800
Don't run.

203
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,400
Stop.

204
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Stop.

205
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't run.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,800
Stop.

207
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Stop.

208
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,120
Chase.

209
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Don't move.

210
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,920
Don't move.

211
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,720
Don't move.

212
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Police.

213
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,720
What do you mean?

214
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Why did you come here?

215
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Why did you run?

216
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
Who dares to run?

217
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm just exercising.

218
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,720
I'm just exercising.

219
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,520
Be serious.

220
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,720
What's your relationship with Lin Ren Rui?

221
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,120
Lin Ren Rui and I are the same mother.

222
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,920
But we don't know each other.

223
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,920
You don't know each other?

224
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,720
If you don't know each other,

225
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
you should be ashamed and borrow money from others.

226
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,720
Who are you to borrow money from?

227
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,320
I'm not a friend.

228
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
I'm not a friend.

229
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm not a friend.

230
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,720
I'm not a friend.

231
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,720
I'm not a friend.

232
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
I'm not a friend.

233
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I'm just trying to borrow money.

234
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,520
My sister raised her brother.

235
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,720
He's the first.

236
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,720
That's what he should do.

237
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,520
That's what he should do.

238
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,320
He should.

239
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,320
Police.

240
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,720
Someone is hitting.

241
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,720
Luoluo.

242
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,120
Lin Ren Rui is now in a coma.

243
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
You're his family.

244
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,120
You have to cooperate with the police.

245
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,520
In a coma?

246
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,720
Is he dead?

247
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,120
Is there any compensation?

248
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,920
How dare you talk like that?

249
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
There's no compensation.

250
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,120
You can't open this handcuff.

251
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
If you don't give me money,

252
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I won't find anyone.

253
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
I'll send you.

254
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
Think about it.

255
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
You want money?

256
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
You can't get out.

257
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,720
How can I think about it?

258
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
You should think about it.

259
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,520
Who is this?

260
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,520
You're so stubborn.

261
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,720
This is the fifth brother.

262
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,720
I'm looking for you.

263
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,920
What's wrong?

264
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
There are indeed five steps of tension in the yalan body.

265
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,720
But the purity is much worse than that of the five-in-one.

266
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,720
I suspect that the source of this medicine

267
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,320
may not be the five-in-one.

268
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Not the five-in-one?

269
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
That's Liu Kui.

270
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,520
The criminal must have the anesthetic.

271
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,120
It's not necessarily the criminal.

272
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
What about the dog?

273
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,120
This kid can't tell the truth.

274
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,520
Li,

275
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
ask your colleague from the Bureau of Investigation to come with me.

276
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,920
Yes, now.

277
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Go to the barbecue shop

278
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,720
and check their ingredients.

279
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,720
What are you doing?

280
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Watch them.

281
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,920
Go back.

282
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Officer!

283
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Come back!

284
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,920
You're so annoying.

285
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
I really can't...

286
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,120
Shi Jiang!

287
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Ning Rui Rui.

288
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Ning Rui Rui.

289
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
We're the police.

290
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,120
You're safe now.

291
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,120
We have a few questions.

292
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,520
We have a few questions.

293
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Where's Yaolan?

294
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Where's Yaolan?

295
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,720
Yaolan is gone.

296
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,320
Ning Rui Rui.

297
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Have you seen her?

298
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,920
She's Nan Nan's boyfriend.

299
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,520
How long has she been in your house?

300
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Once.

301
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Once?

302
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,920
How long has she been in your house?

303
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,520
Two or three weeks.

304
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,120
Or a month.

305
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
I don't remember.

306
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Did you hear anything

307
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,720
from them when she was at home?

308
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,320
No.

309
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
For example, her name,

310
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,920
time,

311
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,320
and location.

312
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,920
Don't worry.

313
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,920
Come on.

314
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,320
Look at the photos.

315
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Think about it.

316
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
The details.

317
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,720
For example, her name,

318
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,520
time,

319
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,120
and location.

320
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,920
Think about it.

321
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
Do you know where Liu Kui is now?

322
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,920
Think about it.

323
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,520
Don't be nervous.

324
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,320
Think about it.

325
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,920
I'm just asking.

326
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,720
You're going to rest now.

327
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
You're leaving now.

328
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
You're leaving now.

329
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,520
Think about it.

330
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,720
Master, she's happy.

331
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,320
Master.

332
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
Think about it.

333
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
She's been at home for so long.

334
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
You might not have heard anything.

335
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,320
Now it's legal society.

336
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,120
I'm going to be locked up for a few hours.

337
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,920
Do you know her?

338
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Do you know how to do it?

339
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
I'm looking for her at your place.

340
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,320
What's the use?

341
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,720
You don't understand.

342
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,520
You have to ask me.

343
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,920
I'm asking you now.

344
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,320
Say it.

345
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,120
Read the script.

346
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,520
Read the script, okay?

347
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
And then?

348
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
It's not easy to open a mutton restaurant.

349
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,920
The cost of mutton is too high.

350
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,120
I have to mix some dog meat in it to save money.

351
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,720
Do you know?

352
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,920
Now technology is so advanced.

353
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,120
This thing, I tell you,

354
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
is useless.

355
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
I haven't eaten anything.

356
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
If it weren't for my family,

357
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Who bought it?

358
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
It must be a dog food seller.

359
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,320
This...

360
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,520
What's the address?

361
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,120
Write it down.

362
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,320
I'm just hot now.

363
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,520
I really can't remember.

364
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,720
Listen to me.

365
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,920
Your poison is related to the drug case.

366
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
You're involved in a fatal case.

367
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,520
If you still refuse to cooperate,

368
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
do you know the consequences?

369
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,920
Write it down.

370
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,520
What does he look like?

371
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,320
Describe it.

372
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,120
What does he look like?

373
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,320
He looks like a man.

374
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,120
A man?

375
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Middle-aged man.

376
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,720
1.65 meters tall.

377
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
With a hole in his face.

378
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
There are many people with a hole in their faces.

379
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
He has one too.

380
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,720
I really can't remember.

381
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,320
I really can't remember.

382
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,120
Where do you usually trade?

383
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,320
I usually trade on the street.

384
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,720
Trade on the street?

385
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,320
Why don't you say you trade in the Public Security Bureau?

386
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,120
We really trade on the street, officer.

387
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,920
We really trade on the street.

388
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,320
Which street?

389
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,920
I can't recognize the name of the street.

390
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,120
You're not honest, are you?

391
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,920
I'm really honest now.

392
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
I'm telling you honestly.

393
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
I'm really honest.

394
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,120
Don't call him.

395
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,120
He might not answer.

396
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,320
He just woke up.

397
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,520
His brain is still messed up.

398
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,320
Wait a minute.

399
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
What are we waiting for?

400
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,520
Can we still wait?

401
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,720
We've caught one person so far.

402
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Don't catch me.

403
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,520
Go catch someone.

404
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,320
I'm sorry, officer.

405
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,520
Don't say sorry to me.

406
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,320
Say sorry to Yao Lan.

407
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,120
Say sorry to those kids who can't come back.

408
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,320
Okay.

409
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
I know who the murderer is.

410
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,920
The feet are broken, the morning is in the way

411
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,920
The unknown night flowers smell like dust

412
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,920
It makes people panic in the wind

413
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,920
Loneliness opens up, the eyes are locked in the farthest place

414
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,920
I put on a piece of grass

415
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Stop here

416
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,320
Is it satisfaction or another kind of attack

417
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:53,120
I'm going to the end of the road

418
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:01,320
Is there freedom ahead or broken bones

419
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,320
I've crossed a few lines

420
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,920
I've been through a few hardships

421
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,720
I just started to remember the beginning of the journey

422
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,320
I've cried a few tears

423
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,720
I've broken a few books

424
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I just realized happiness can't be caught or kept
