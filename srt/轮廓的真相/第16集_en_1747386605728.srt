The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 18

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Are we lost?

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Where are we?

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We've passed.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We've passed this mountain.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If we don't search,

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
believe me.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's go.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's wrong?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're all my children.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What do you want in your heart?

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't know.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Say it.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why did you leave me?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Is it because of Su Yun, that dumb?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Dad.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's nothing to do with the Xiao family.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I decided it.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's all my decision.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Since you're leaving,

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
then leave.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll leave.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll leave.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll leave.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Dad.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll watch Mu Zeng.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ah Kui.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Xiao Jiang!

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Xiao Jiang!

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Ah Kui.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And Xiao Hai.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He's dead.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Xiao Jiang.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Xiao Hai.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Xiao Hai.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Xiao Hai.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Xiao Hai.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Xiao Hai.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Xiao Hai.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Xiao Hai.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Xiao Hai.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Xiao Hai.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Xiao Hai.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Xiao Hai.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Xiao Hai.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Xiao Hai.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,160
remind

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,080
An old man took enove

53
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,880
We found a handouts Women and two code pieces

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,480
sees both An pistachio

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,040
You'reeee

56
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,440
Gu Da,

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
there's a footprint at the door.

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,040
Let's go.

59
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,360
Gu Da,

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,440
it's this one.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
This footprint was found

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,360
in the comparison.

63
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,080
It was found at the scene of Yang Dong's death.

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
You mean this man killed Yang Dong first

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,640
and now he's here to kill Liu Kui?

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,640
What does Grandma Qin have to do with him?

67
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,160
I dare have to kill him對嘛

68
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,560
why must grandma Qin do this to us?

69
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,200
Hurry, give me some stock.

70
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,280
Fast.

71
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,680
Don't sleep.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,280
Master!

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,480
Ass.

74
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,000
ча.

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,280
I know who they are!

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,000
They are mother and child.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,560
Yes, they are...

78
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,600
Mother and child.

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,760
He needs us to buy a robot to send.

80
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
If someone is angry,

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
Mrs. Qin has been living here for almost 10 years.

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,840
She's always been like this when she comes here.

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,880
It's not normal.

85
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,440
She waits for her son in the garden every day.

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,280
I heard she's been living here for more than 20 years.

87
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,400
She's been living here for more than 20 years?

88
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
Liu Kui?

89
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
She's a street kid too.

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,920
Did any strangers come here last night?

91
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,480
There are visitors and volunteers every day.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,120
You can remember the knowledge class.

93
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,080
Think about it again.

94
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,520
Did anything strange happen last night?

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,200
Strange?

96
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,560
By the way,

97
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,880
when I was looking for a room before the new light,

98
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,760
I saw a volunteer washing dishes in the kitchen.

99
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,600
But there's no volunteer who stays for so long.

100
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,240
Did you see what he looks like?

101
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,320
His head looks round and big.

102
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,360
His face is long.

103
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,440
No, his face is square.

104
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,080
His chin is a little wide.

105
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
His head is high.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
His hair is a little long.

107
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,440
It seems to be here.

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,240
Long hair.

109
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,520
Yes, his hair is high.

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,080
Is it him?

111
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,360
Yes.

112
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,920
He's the one I saw last night.

113
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
He looks familiar.

114
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,080
And that man also had a new ID card in the soup

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
a few months ago.

116
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,200
This is him.

117
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,640
Luo Hai Xiao.

118
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Luo Hai Xiao.

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,040
Luo Hai Xiao.

120
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,880
Luo Hai Xiao.

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,680
Luo Hai Xiao.

122
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,560
Luo Hai Xiao.

123
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,480
Luo Hai Xiao.

124
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,360
Luo Hai Xiao.

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Luo Hai Xiao.

126
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
Let Xiao Zhou make another confirmation

127
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,320
to confirm if Luo Hai Xiao's identity is the same.

128
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,960
Yes.

129
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,880
Please take good care of Aunt Qing.

130
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,280
Give her some money to buy nutrition.

131
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,200
Yes.

132
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,760
According to Mr. Qu's portrait,

133
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,000
we can confirm that

134
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,960
the person who bought the anesthetic to Wu Cong

135
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,960
is him.

136
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,360
Xu Hong Lai.

137
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,600
His nickname is Ah Lai.

138
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
He's 29 years old.

139
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,960
He wears a seamless passport.

140
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,360
He's engaged in water production.

141
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,320
Zhao Zhi, I have another discovery.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,280
Do you remember the Beauty Palace?

143
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,520
It's the Beauty Palace where Liu Kui

144
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,760
was kidnapped and kidnapped by his father.

145
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,880
Enough.

146
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,080
Don't say the last sentence.

147
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,840
Xu Hong Lai

148
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,680
is one of the shareholders of the Beauty Palace.

149
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,680
Now it's all connected.

150
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,760
What we can confirm is

151
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,360
Liu Kui, Yang Dong and Xu Hong Lai

152
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,400
are all part of the same population sale organization.

153
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,160
So the 12 children we lost

154
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,680
are likely to be in this gang.

155
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,520
What about him?

156
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,720
What does he have to do with them?

157
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,280
The three of them are clearly

158
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,640
for the population sale.

159
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,280
But Luo Hai Xiao,

160
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,560
I didn't find him

161
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,000
related to the population sales.

162
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,760
He's more like

163
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,440
he's doing it for the sake of killing.

164
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,520
He's a killer.

165
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
Someone will hire him

166
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,200
to clean the door.

167
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,040
The killer's method will be more sharp.

168
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,840
If he's not,

169
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,840
it means he's a murderer.

170
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,720
Did he lose his child too?

171
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,760
Does Liu Kui and Yang Dong

172
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,000
have such a secret weapon?

173
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,720
Why would Luo Hai Xiao kill

174
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,800
someone with such a secret weapon?

175
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,040
So our next target

176
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,680
is to find out

177
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,040
Luo Hai Xiao's motive for killing.

178
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,440
Su Yun?

179
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,760
Are you okay?

180
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,520
The stuff is gone.

181
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,560
It's not going to last.

182
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,920
Next door,

183
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,760
there's a shoe seller

184
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,720
named Sun.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Go find him.

186
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,560
But you have to tell him

187
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,440
your…

188
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:23,880
Hey.

189
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,640
Did you not tell him

190
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,600
it connected to the cigarettes

191
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,520
and the small red shoes?

192
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,300
The two

193
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,000
essential gauze shoes.

194
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,720
Do you get it?

195
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,400
That's it.

196
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,440
It will help you have time to think straight.

197
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,600
Do you like it, little boy?

198
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,640
I want the red pair of liner 서면 언� employed

199
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,400
Who let you come?

200
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,800
Hello?

201
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm saying this out of these three big size bricks and rubbishes

202
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,180
are the best for you.

203
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,880
The foot porch flourishes not only in fine darker Probst produce

204
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,060
but also OO0000000000 at the songs.

205
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,000
Your companies,

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,020
contributors or people that want to change the surfbikes

207
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,260
make up the model lean.

208
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,020
Don't you really think that

209
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,660
He.

210
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,860
Follow him.

211
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,980
Okay.

212
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,540
Brother,

213
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,500
the thing you want has appeared.

214
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,860
I want to find my father.

215
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,140
I'll go.

216
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,740
How much?

217
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,100
30 gold bars.

218
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,460
3 million.

219
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
The 3 million you got back then

220
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,420
is not worth three times the amount you got now.

221
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Two little thieves

222
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,340
who are trying to make us faint

223
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,780
and then they kidnap our couple.

224
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,740
Do you believe it?

225
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,780
Do you?

226
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,180
I don't believe it anyway.

227
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,940
Who does he think he is?

228
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,820
He is the former third-year.

229
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,220
The main target of the blackout ten years ago.

230
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,020
So what?

231
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
It means that when he came out

232
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,140
to mess around ten years ago,

233
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,660
you failed the exam.

234
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,740
He's a chef now,

235
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,740
right?

236
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,460
He didn't make it for me.

237
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,140
The former third-year said

238
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,420
the traces of the kidnappers are in the lock.

239
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,220
But the ones who are with Yang Dong and Liu Kui

240
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,020
are not.

241
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,820
Does it mean that

242
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,100
they are not the kidnappers?

243
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,620
Even if they didn't meet

244
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,260
Tang Cheng that night,

245
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,340
it doesn't mean they are not accomplices.

246
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,740
Do you remember Liu Kui

247
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,380
has been looking for Yang Dong

248
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,780
for the same important thing?

249
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,020
You mean

250
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,620
that thing

251
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,980
is the kidnapper?

252
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,980
The gold bar.

253
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,580
Is there such a possibility?

254
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,260
After Tang Cheng's gold bar was stolen,

255
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,820
he went to Yang Dong to get it.

256
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,980
Then Tang Cheng set up the trap.

257
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,740
Yang Dong hid the gold bar first.

258
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,020
A few months later,

259
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,020
Yang Dong was deliberately

260
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
hurt and was arrested.

261
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,420
The gold bar was missing.

262
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,940
So his accomplices

263
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,140
can only wait until Yang Dong

264
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,660
is out of prison

265
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,860
to continue the funeral.

266
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,100
So Liu Kui, Luo Haixiao

267
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,500
and that A-Lai

268
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,420
all went there

269
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,700
with that huge amount of money.

270
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,860
Since Luo Haixiao has killed Yang Dong,

271
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,780
it means the gold bar is in his hands.

272
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,020
Why did he kill Liu Kui?

273
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,700
What was his purpose?

274
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,460
Will he continue to kill?

275
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,540
Yes.

276
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,340
Hello.

277
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,260
Mom.

278
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,260
I know where the gold bar is.

279
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,860
I'll get it back for you soon.

280
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,380
Come on.

281
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,580
Brother.

282
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,460
It's really you.

283
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,780
Take me to see him.

284
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,660
Where is he?

285
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,980
Why are you so anxious?

286
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,540
I never know where he is.

287
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,820
Where is he?

288
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,620
Give me the phone.

289
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,620
I'm not afraid of him.

290
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,660
I'll call him.

291
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,300
Don't worry.

292
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,260
I'll show you something first.

293
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,860
Who is he?

294
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,260
I don't know him.

295
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,900
Fine.

296
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,140
Give me a suggestion.

297
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,060
They took my stuff.

298
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,260
What should I do?

299
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,140
I'll pee here.

300
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,180
Right here.

301
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,740
Come on.

302
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,540
I should stop here

303
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,500
with a piece of grass.

304
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,420
Is it satisfaction

305
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,860
or another kind of progress?

306
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm going to continue my endless journey

307
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,180
through the end of the world.

308
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,180
Is there freedom ahead

309
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,420
or a broken heart?

310
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,580
I've crossed many mountains

311
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,500
and crossed many rivers.

312
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,940
I've just started to miss

313
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,340
the way I left.

314
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,340
I've cried many tears

315
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,260
and cried many tears.

316
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,660
I've just realized

317
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,340
happiness can't be caught and can't be kept.
