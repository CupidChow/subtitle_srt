Episode 2

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Brother

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to see Su Yuan.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't want to go.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Fine.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll go after I finish my soup.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll go after I finish my soup.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Taoism Grandmaster

13
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Taoism Grandmaster

14
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Brother

15
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Taoism Grandmaster

16
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Xiao Jiang

17
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I left the money to you.

18
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I just followed what he said.

19
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I stopped him.

20
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mom

21
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Dad

22
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Mom

23
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Gu

24
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I saw it.

25
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I saw it.

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I saw it.

27
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I saw it.

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I saw it.

29
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I saw it grow up.

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It never left me.

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll be out for a few days.

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You help me take care of it.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Mom

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Mom

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Mom

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It doesn't have a mom.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But it has a bunch of dads.

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It has a bunch of dads.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It grew up in the mine.

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You exchange the gold

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
with the old man's gold.

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Then you can use it yourself.

43
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No need.

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's making me angry.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm angry.

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm angry.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Taoism Grandmaster

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Brother Kui, I'm sorry.

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I drank too much water when I came out.

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Where are we going?

51
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This car will cross the border tonight.

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Brother Lai asked me to send you to the port.

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Someone will take you back to the house.

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why didn't he come?

55
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He went out.

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Where did he go?

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
How would I know?

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's go.

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go.

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No need to find it.

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is it.

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Brother Kui, you're here.

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's talk about it.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is not the way to the port.

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What do you want to do?

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know.

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You don't know?

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Brother Kui, you...

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I say

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm the aunt.

71
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Aunt asked me to take you out.

72
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Then I thought of a way.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Just you?

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Where did Lai go?

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He went to Jiang Zhen.

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Jiang Zhen?

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Get off the car.

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I told you to get off the car.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
OK, OK, OK.

80
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Brother Kui, I'll stay here.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
OK.

82
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Brother Kui.

83
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Kui,

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
do you think you can run away?

85
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Mom,

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
do you have to kill me?

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is the end of being disobedient

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and betraying me.

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
In the prison in Jiang Zhen,

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
your mother

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
waited for you there for a lifetime.

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Do you really want to leave her

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and run away?

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Obviously, she has single-eyed.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What is this?

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Shadow.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Look.

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's a shadow.

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How is it?

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Xiao Zhi, look.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This should be the suspect

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
who bought the anesthetic.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Lin Shen,

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
take it to check.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
OK.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Brother,

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
don't touch her.

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is for your own good.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where is mom?

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Brother,

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
mom killed him.

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
She killed him right away.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is the end of being disobedient

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and betraying me.

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Your mother

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
waited for you there for a lifetime.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Where did she go?

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
She went to Jiang Zhen.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Jiang Zhen.

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In the prison in Jiang Zhen,

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
your mother

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
waited for you there for a lifetime.

123
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Liu Ketong's special line.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hello.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's me.

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What do you want?

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
An Hexian,

129
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Jiang Zhen,

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and the prison.

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
She is in danger now.

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You have to protect her.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't talk nonsense.

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Listen to me.

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You protect her.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll find you.

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Jiang Zhen, the prison.

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hurry up.

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's go.

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hurry up.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Is she lost?

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Where is she?

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
She went over this mountain.

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
She just didn't send me.

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Trust me.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What's wrong?

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Xiaoxiao.

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Xiaoxiao.

149
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Xiaoxiao.

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Xiaoxiao.

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Xiaohai,

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I know you've always wanted revenge.

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But your brother's death can't blame me.

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Kui is the real murderer.

155
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He is now in the prison in Jiang Zhen.

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This is your last chance.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Xiaoxiao.

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Xiaoxiao.

159
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Xiaoxiao.

160
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Xiaoxiao.

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Xiaoxiao.

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Xiaoxiao.

163
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Xiaoxiao.

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Xiaoxiao.

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Xiaoxiao.

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Xiaoxiao.

167
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Xiaoxiao.

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Xiaoxiao.

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Xiaoxiao.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Xiaoxiao.

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Xiaoxiao.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Xiaoxiao.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Xiaoxiao.

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Xiaoxiao.

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Xiaoxiao.

176
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Xiaoxiao.

177
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Xiaoxiao.

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Xiaoxiao.

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Xiaoxiao.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Xiaoxiao.

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Xiaoxiao.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Xiaoxiao.

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Xiaoxiao.

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,460
Xiaoxiao,

185
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,000
could you call my son?

186
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
My son.

187
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Liu Kui is a wanted criminal.

188
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,580
He's a dangerous man with weapons.

189
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,100
No matter what the reason is,

190
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,460
don't let him get away with it.

191
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,260
Yes, sir.

192
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:49,980
Yes, sir.

193
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,660
Let's go.

194
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,720
Go.

195
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,380
Don't move, shared weapons.

196
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,540
Drag halter.

197
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,100
Drag halter.

198

200
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,220
Calm down!

201
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:48,980
Hurry!

202
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,500

203
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,580
The어요 отп Grammy.

204
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,260

205
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,620
There isn't aRoom here.

206
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,700
Blood.

207
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,020
I need that kitten.

208
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,420
What for?

209
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
For等 Horse?

210
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,580
The lady took her under this soul.

211
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,380
I'm wandering in the wind

212
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,580
Loneliness is open

213
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,480
The most distant place to lock eyes

214
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,380
I change a piece of grass

215
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,080
Stop here

216
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,380
Is it satisfied

217
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,780
Or another kind of attack

218
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,780
I'm going into the mouth

219
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,780
Continue the endless journey

220
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,780
Is there freedom ahead

221
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,780
Or is it broken

222
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,780
I crossed the two lines

223
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,780
I taught a few songs

224
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,780
I just started to miss

225
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,780
The mountain path when I first started

226
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,780
I can't cry

227
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,780
I can't break through the books

228
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,780
I just know happiness

229
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,780
Can't catch, can't keep
