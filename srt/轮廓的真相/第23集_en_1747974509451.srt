Episode 18

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
One is born, one dies.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You are a jinx, you know?

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You are a traitor.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why don't you die?

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why are you alive?

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
My grandson.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
My grandson.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
God.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why did you take my grandson away?

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Please take this woman away.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Please take this heart away.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Please take this heart away.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I beg you, God.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I beg you.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I beg you.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Please take her away.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Please take this heart away.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
God.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
God, I beg you.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Taoism Grandmaster

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Excuse me.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm looking for a nanny.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm looking for a nanny.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Miss, do you want to be a nanny?

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Just help me take the child.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
One child.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you want to try?

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The child is dead.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Dead?

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can't keep any of them.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
People are being kidnapped,

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and the gang is being robbed.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
The leader of the gang is being

40
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
a criminal.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He is deliberately hurting and murdering

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
the young.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Zhang Guiping,

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
you are the most capable suspect

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I've ever seen.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Alright.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's start from the first kid you kidnapped.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I got married at 18.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I had two kids.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
One of them lived for 40 days.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The other died when he was born.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They said I was strong and strong-willed.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I had to go out and pick one up

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to keep it alive.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I could save my life.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So I went to pick it up.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How many years?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
1982.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I was born in 1982.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was born in 1982.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
1982.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The first time I was a nanny,

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I took Alan away.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This baby is so cute.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's his name?

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
His name is Alan.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Alan.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Alan.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I raised them.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Kui,

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hai,

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Jiang,

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and Dong.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
My five tigers.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They are all dead.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They are all dead.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
They don't understand.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Here, give it to me.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go play.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Give me your phone.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Kui.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Kui.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Kui.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Open it.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You changed it today.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
When that auntie got up and ran away,

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
she kept crying and screaming.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's scary.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't worry.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No one will know that you did it.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That auntie

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
won't know who you are.

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You go together tomorrow.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Remember,

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
no one is smarter than you.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You'll know when you're capable.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
In this world,

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
there's nothing

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you can't get.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I know.

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I know.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How did you

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
fake their identities?

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Twenty years ago,

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
there was a nurse

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
named Li Xia

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in the county health center.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I spent

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
some money

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
on her birth certificate.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But she died of cancer.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I didn't go there.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:13,560
So, youいいt接下來

114
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,360
It's even better

115
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
if it were water oriver.

116
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,240
Yeah.

117
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,400
She's worried all the time.

118
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,080
She isINTorde temperature in the distinguish one.

119
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,560
At least

120
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,320
the tir-tare tastes good.

121
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,480
Then

122
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,680
you could use it to bring up a savior.

123
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,440
It will be much more convenient

124
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,640
for me to take Mu out of ours.

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,920
If I don't go to the station today,

126
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,840
how could you catch me?

127
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,760
Zhang Guiping,

128
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,400
you're destined to be

129
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,000
caught on the day of the special group.

130
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,800
Tell me,

131
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,120
how many people were there?

132
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,520
More than ten.

133
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,320
I can't remember.

134
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,480
The younger ones sold out.

135
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,760
The older ones

136
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,560
stayed by my side and did things for me.

137
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,800
You stole the gold from Tang City?

138
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,960
I worked in a villa for half a year.

139
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,360
I know

140
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,920
the gold is not clean.

141
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,160
I'd rather give it to my children.

142
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,760
Don't make a big fuss.

143
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,800
After you enter the room,

144
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,720
you control Tang City and the bodyguards.

145
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,080
You hold a meeting alone.

146
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,040
Who will go?

147
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,640
I have no ideas.

148
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,480
What about going out?

149
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
Honey,

150
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,460
you're here,

151
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,380
okay?

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,440
Sable.

153
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,840
You're too heavy, bro.

154
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
I'll go with you.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,880
You only ordered Huang Jiang and Luo Hai

156
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
to rob the school.

157
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,080
Then you want to kill them?

158
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,120
Is that right?

159
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Is he lost?

160
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,400
Where is he?

161
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,000
After crossing this mountain,

162
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,640
he's still not here.

163
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,360
Trust me.

164
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,200
Let's go.

165
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,760
What's wrong?

166
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,360
Go.

167
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,920
You're all my children.

168
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,320
I know what you're thinking.

169
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,600
Tell me.

170
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Why did you leave me?

171
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,240
Is it for Su Yun, the mute?

172
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,040
Mom.

173
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,200
It's nothing to do with Jiang.

174
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,720
I decided it.

175
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,520
It's all my idea.

176
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,600
It's all my idea.

177
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,240
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,160
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Since you're leaving,

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,720
then go.

181
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,240
I'll watch you leave.

182
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,960
A'Kui.

183
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,160
Dad.

184
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,440
There's still a chance.

185
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,640
Jiang!

186
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,640
Jiang!

187
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,120
DirtyFare

188
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,520
I'm their mother.

189
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,120
They were not obedient.

190
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,520
Then they're not your children.

191
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,000
It's true.

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,520
They're not your sons.

193
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,360
They're not!

194
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,520
If it wasn't for me,

195
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,120
They were dead long ago.

196
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,360
Zhang Guiping,

197
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,400
you've never saved anyone

198
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,080
in your life.

199
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,600
Every crime you committed,

200
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,880
every victim's crime,

201
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,000
the law will investigate it.

202
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,080
It won't miss out.

203
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,440
The Lawyer's Office

204
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
This kid,

205
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
have you seen him?

206
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
I know him.

207
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,120
Did you see him clearly?

208
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,840
Look again!

209
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
You said you didn't know him.

210
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,520
Look at this photo.

211
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,080
I'll ask you again.

212
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,120
In 2005,

213
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,080
on the sixth day of the 5th month,

214
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,560
in the afternoon,

215
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
in the Qing Family's courtyard,

216
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,560
this ten-year-old kid...

217
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,800
This kid

218
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,000
is yours.

219
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,400
Have you seen him?

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,400
The wild flowers of fate

221
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,080
remind me of the town

222
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
that makes people panic.

223
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,920
In the wind,

224
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
loneliness opens up

225
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,080
and locks my eyes

226
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,080
to the farthest place.

227
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,240
I should

228
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,040
stop here

229
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,680
with a piece of grass.

230
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,760
Is it enough

231
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,000
to be satisfied

232
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,520
or another kind of happiness?

233
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,520
Everyday is a farewell

234
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,360
to a map of the solors she applied.

235
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,840
Life is

236
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,040
just a bag 덕

237
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,960
to keep moving

238
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,760
toward

239
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,600
never-ending dermis.

240
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,240
Do I still have

241
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,940
free blow

242
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,760
ensa and bı?
