Episode 18

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Taoism Grandmaster

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't be a coward.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're a coward.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
My stomach hurts.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My stomach hurts.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's go.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Taoism Grandmaster

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
My stomach hurts.

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Come on.

18
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Where are you going?

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
To eat something.

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Didn't you say you didn't know me?

21
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What did you do to them?

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You took the gold and hit me.

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What should I do?

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let them go.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You won't get the gold.

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll beat you to death.

27
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Brother.

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We have five brothers.

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Brother, Brother Jiang, Dong.

30
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Dong is gone.

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We only have two brothers left.

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Can we

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
be good brothers?

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll give you the gold back.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mom.

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You can't be a coward.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're a coward.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're all so good.

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I only have mom.

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll tell you where the gold is.

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Where?

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Come here.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll beat you to death.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let them go.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's a chance to see the gold.

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll beat you to death.

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll beat you to death.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll beat you to death.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll beat you to death.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll beat you to death.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll beat you to death.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll beat you to death.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll beat you to death.

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll beat you to death.

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll beat you to death.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll beat you to death.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll beat you to death.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll beat you to death.

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll beat you to death.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll beat you to death.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll beat you to death.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll beat you to death.

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll beat you to death.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll beat you to death.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll beat you to death.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's go.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's go.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Miss.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The mute auntie asked me to send you back.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you want to go back?

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,160
It's your mother.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,840
Do you know why your father

75
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,960
wanted to find her?

76
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,880
Do you understand?

77
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,200
You made a mistake.

78
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,000
What?

79
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
You will be...

80
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,800
You want to see my mother?

81
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,640
Mother...

82
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,800
My friend,

83
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
be careful

84
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,120
when taming a rat.

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,260
Increased- defending!

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,760
I'm sorry.

87
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,400
Hello?

88
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,480
Brother Hai.

89
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,880
Luo Hai ran away from the car.

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,320
Brother Hai ran away?

91
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,080
Okay.

92
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,960
Turn right.

93
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,080
Turn right.

94
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,160
Sï¿½ï¿½ pare four

95
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,260
Immediately

96
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,900
Stop

97
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,080
Follow

98
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,800
Coming? Who's that?

99
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,400
Open the door.

100
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Coming.

101
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,120
Hurry.

102
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,680
You're going to die.

103
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,920
What's wrong?

104
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,920
Zhao, listen.

105
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,080
You always go to the hospital to see him.

106
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,720
I think you

107
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,000
have a false symptom.

108
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,360
You need to treat it if you're sick.

109
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't come to me.

110
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,760
It's still Tang Cheng's business.

111
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,160
You were so many people back then.

112
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,960
It's impossible that you didn't have any clues

113
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,200
after ten years of hard work.

114
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,360
It's not that we didn't have any.

115
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,720
You're capable.

116
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,000
Stop talking nonsense.

117
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm telling you, Mr. Qian.

118
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,720
Now because of these gold bars,

119
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,760
people are dying.

120
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,040
Just do it.

121
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,520
You go first.

122
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,080
I'll take care of it.

123
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,760
What's this?

124
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,280
Didn't you say that Tang Cheng had a nanny?

125
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,120
Take a look.

126
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,120
Do you remember her?

127
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,800
The nanny is missing.

128
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,640
Tang Cheng went to find

129
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,320
the nanny's photo.

130
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,320
But she couldn't find it.

131
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,520
How can I know where she is?

132
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Her name is Liu Kui.

133
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,920
Xu Honglan.

134
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,720
Yang Dong.

135
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,200
Luo Haixiao.

136
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,000
These are not necessarily real names.

137
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,320
But they are.

138
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,880
These are not necessarily real names.

139
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
But they are likely to be a criminal group.

140
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,000
Who is she?

141
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
You don't know?

142
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
I know.

143
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,800
Her name is Huang Jiang.

144
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,040
Huang Jiang?

145
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,720
Yes.

146
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,600
Did you see her after the gold bars were lost?

147
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,280
No.

148
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Really?

149
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,720
What's wrong with you?

150
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,280
Is she...

151
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,080
Is she a loafer?

152
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,320
How much do you know about Huang Jiang?

153
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,000
How much do I know?

154
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,560
I've only met her a few times.

155
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,040
She's a nice girl.

156
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
She's pretty handsome.

157
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,160
She told me that

158
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,520
she had a few brothers

159
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,600
raised by a woman

160
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
on the railway.

161
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,800
Who is that woman?

162
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,720
I don't know.

163
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,840
I've never seen her.

164
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,720
Si'an.

165
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,520
Think about it.

166
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
What?

167
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,920
You have a broad mind.

168
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,920
I know.

169
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Go away.

170
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,880
What should I do?

171
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,640
Leave it to me.

172
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,920
Mr. Zhao.

173
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,080
Look at me.

174
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,200
Look how close we are.

175
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,320
Am I a computer?

176
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,000
Where should I talk about this

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,680
and this later?

178
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,400
Am I in the second level?

179
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,760
Don't you think your neighbor

180
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,720
is so drunk that you have to ask about me?

181
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,240
You are aware that

182
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,520
where I run to...

183
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,160
I remember.

184
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,000
Gui...

185
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
Gui Hua's Gui... Guiyi.

186
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,400
Guiyi.

187
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,080
Okay, I got it.

188
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
Ask me if you need anything.

189
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Thanks for the meal.

190
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,200
Don't mention it. I owe you.

191
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,400
Yeah.

192
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,840
You still owe me 200 yuan.

193
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,880
Here, take it.

194
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,240
What's wrong with you?

195
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,160
You haven't found the strange news

196
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
I've been looking for.

197
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,440
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,120
I don't know this person either.

199
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,800
I don't think I've seen her before.

200
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,520
She's the mother of these five people?

201
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,920
Where's Dai Qian on the 5th?

202
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,280
Where's Dai Qian?

203
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,920
She's not here.

204
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,440
Take the kid home.

205
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,240
Go to see me.

206
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,200
Mom will be back soon.

207
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,800
Dai Qian, Dai Qian.

208
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Listen to me.

209
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,440
Bye.

210
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,160
Go.

211
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,000
Go.

212
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,960
Sir.

213
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,040
Here.

214
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,400
It's done.

215
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,200
She...

216
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,880
She...

217
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,520
She's the nanny of Dai Qian's family.

218
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,720
The child is sleeping.

219
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,840
Police.

220
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,600
Is Zhang Guiping here?

221
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,960
Please cooperate.

222
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,800
Stop.

223
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,000
Who are you?

224
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,760
Who allowed you in?

225
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,880
Mrs. Zhang is not here.

226
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,680
She resigned yesterday.

227
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,240
Where did she go?

228
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,080
Did you get the phone?

229
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,960
I didn't.

230
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,800
Did you see her?

231
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,520
No.

232
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
But I saw her.

233
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,320
We didn't see her.

234
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,120
She's not here.

235
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,960
She's not here.

236
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,560
Let's go.

237
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,120
Let's go.

238
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,920
Let's go.

239
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,640
Let's go.

240
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,240
Let's go.

241
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,920
Let's go.

242
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,640
Let's go.

243
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,560
Let's go.

244
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,080
Let's go.

245
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,680
Let's go.

246
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,320
Let's go.

247
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's go.

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,760
Did you get the phone?

249
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,200
No.

250
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,000
No phone.

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,440
There must be an intermediary.

252
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
We suspect that Zhang Guiping...

253
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,480
What else can you suspect?

254
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,800
My daughter-in-law

255
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,360
was caught by you.

256
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,000
If you say that

257
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,280
our nanny is the problem,

258
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,520
will you stop?

259
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,840
Is your child okay?

260
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,600
I told you.

261
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,640
She's sleeping.

262
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,240
Let's go.

263
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,760
She's a poor girl.

264
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,720
She's not good.

265
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,200
This...

266
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
Sorry, prankster.

267
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,520
You have been skinship'ed resultant.

268
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,960
This girl,

269
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
how was her sleeping latest?

270
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,280
Advisory report,

271
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,320
that is,

272
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,040
from Wang Zhen for Zhang Guiping.

273
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,160
Exams?

274
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,360
Yes.

275
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,240
From what?

276
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,360
Is the situation not bad?

277
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,080
Caning is not safe now.

278
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,840
You're worried?

279
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,600
Yes.

280
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,720
Leave the capital the day after tomorrow.

281
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,040
Go to Manchuria first.

282
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,280
When I get the gold,

283
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,640
I'll pick you up and send you back to Wusu.

284
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,440
We'll deal with

285
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,560
the little Palao later.

286
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,000
You make the decision this time.

287
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,840
I won't interfere.

288
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,560
Don't worry.

289
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,600
I've arranged it.

290
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,320
I've already made the way out of the capital.

291
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,280
I'll send all the kids

292
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,040
the day after tomorrow.

293
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,000
Add another one.

294
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,760
Add another one?

295
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,200
No.

296
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,600
I want Dai Qian's son, too.

297
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,600
Okay.

298
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,880
I understand.

299
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,840
I'll find another good kid

300
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,840
to be his friend.

301
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,800
