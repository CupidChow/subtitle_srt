Taoism Grandmaster

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What are you doing?

21
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Come, look at the business

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you doing?

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why are you doing this?

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yu Jia

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yu Jia

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The funds are not safe

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The client is going to turn over

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm going back to the country

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
To borrow a new batch of goods

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're going back to Taining?

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're going back right away?

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yang Dong is out of Japan

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Mom asked me to go back and get something from him

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's been eight years

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's time to take it out

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If we can get the stuff back

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Things here will be in trouble

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Brother

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How many goods do you have this time?

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't worry about me

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Be careful

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But Yang Dong has been in there for so long

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How can you be sure

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He didn't tell the police

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He dare not

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I really can't stay in this hell

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Dad, dad, dad

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't come, don't come

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Dad, open the door

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Go back after handling

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
understand

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yang Dong

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Action

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
From August last year to April this year

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
My province's southeast

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Including five counties in Taining

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Eight women and twelve children disappeared in a row

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Influenced by machine evil

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Highly valued by the city

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Decided to set up a case

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The code name is hunting

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I am the team leader

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Vice team leader has the provincial team leader

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Zhao Shi is in charge

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Zhao Shi, you tell everyone

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Specific situation

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Everyone, after our investigation for months

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We locked the boss of Meili Palace KTV

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ma Li is suspected of murder

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Brother, brother

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's go to the factory, brothers

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sister Li Li is busy with flying recently

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't know when to pay

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What should she be busy with

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There is a customer coming

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Discovered through the monitoring

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Strange girls in Meili Palace enter and exit frequently

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But some girls are interesting

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Brother Wang, why are you here?

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Really, you don't call me

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
During the implementation of the task

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Our police investigation was accidentally discovered

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We have been investigating for a long time

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The top suspect Liu Kui

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Has been imported from abroad

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This criminal group is very bad

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There are people who introduce people

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Interact with people

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Brother, smile

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I smiled

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And the middleman is responsible for the sale

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In addition, there are people who raise people and transport people

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The reason we will lock Liu Kui

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Because he is the one in this group

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Transport person

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You are going to cut this middle way

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes, go

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's up

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Why are you here

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I've been looking for you for a long time

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you investigating?

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm on duty today to cooperate with you

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You are so ungrateful

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll call you tonight

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll come back

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Go, go, go

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll go later

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm going to six

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Six, six, six

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Six, six, six

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Now there is a new situation

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I found Liu Kui in your room

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Liu Kui

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Are you sure it's him?

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sure

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I only saw the side face

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I won't see it wrong

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll apply for help and arrest me directly

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Brother Kui

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can rest assured

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
My goods

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Always the best

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's talk about business

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I personally selected this batch of goods

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
How about

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Satisfied

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How much

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I want the old price

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Thank you boss

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The big team will arrive in ten minutes

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You must drag Liu Kui out in ten minutes

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
understand

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Are you sure the passage is the electronic door?

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
OK, I'll think of a way to get into the house and drag him

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You go to the station and lock the electronic door

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Brother, sister

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
My family has money

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I have a lot of money

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
My dad will give you whatever you want

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Please let me go

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I promise

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I won't say anything

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I promise to cooperate

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Really

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Come out

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Come out

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Can't sing any songs

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Isn't it for Bao?

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You tell me

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Listen to me

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Bao

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Brother Bao, come back later

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Come back later

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Come back later

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Good

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll show you how to cooperate

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Come back later

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Liu Kui

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Li Li

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are good

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You won't save me in such a good place

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Who is this

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
A VIP brought

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't be angry and get him away

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Boss, my brother

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Get out

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He can play, I can't

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Who are you

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Three

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Two

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
One

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Two

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Just got the news

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The police in the lower section are attacking the Meili Palace

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Lower section

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Where is Zhao Shi

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I can't contact him

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Police, please

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Bring out the rest of the people in the house

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Come on, come on

184
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Come on, come on

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This way, this way

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This way, come on

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hurry up

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The mask wall

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Come on, come on

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come on, come on

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Come on, come on

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This house, come on, come on

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Cooperate, thank you

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Mask wall

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Come on, come on

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Everyone came out from the toilet

197

It's too noisy

Do you know who I am?

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The one who asked me to come back

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Stop, what are you doing?

Chief, I checked it

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This should not be

250
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
A simple silver factory

251
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
These girls are all drugged

252
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Chief, as expected

272
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The people from Meili Palace pulled the plug

273
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Open the plug

No brother or sister

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Want to threaten me

284
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You have no way
