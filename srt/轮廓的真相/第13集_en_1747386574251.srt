00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Lan Lan.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Lan Lan, don't be impulsive.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He's definitely got something wrong.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Maybe he's got money.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's wrong with having money?

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What's wrong with me liking him?

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Think about it.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How long have you been apart?

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He said he disappeared,

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and said he was not fit for each other.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You said it.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you know Liu Kui?

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If he's lying to you...

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I said it!

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Lan Lan.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He's back.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Lan Lan, you...

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come here.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yao Lan.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yao Lan.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yao Lan.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yao Lan!

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's you.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Tell me.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Which part of me is not good enough for you?

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What's good about that old man?

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He's rich, right?

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come here.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Are you crazy?

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can make money too.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come here.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is it enough?

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Is it enough?

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Come here.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is it enough?

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is it enough?

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you yelling at?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is it enough?

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wu Song, are you crazy?

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Are you crazy?

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Get out!

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you doing?

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You...

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't touch me!

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't touch me!

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't touch me!

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let go!

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let go!

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's okay.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's okay.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He's just a self-made nerd.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Who does he think he is?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He comes to bully Yao Lan when he's drunk.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just knocked him out.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why did you kill Yao Lan?

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Because Yao Lan is leaving.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I miss Ah Kuen.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Calm down.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Look at me.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ah Kuen has left.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He won't come back.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Calm down.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Look at me.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll be with you.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Ah Kuen has left.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Ah Kuen doesn't want me anymore.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But I'm here.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll be with you, okay?

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I've been here since Liu Kui left.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't touch me.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I have to go find him.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yao Lan, calm down.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you looking at me?

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have to go find him.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I have to go find him.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I have to go find him.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I have to go find him.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I have to go find him.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I have to go find him.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yao Lan.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you really leaving?

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What if I don't leave?

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is it okay for me to leave?

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I got it.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll go find him.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yao Lan.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will go find him.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want to go find him.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I want to go find him.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I saw him drink up the water and then give it to Wu Cong.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
For him, Wu Cong can die.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My brother can die too.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But what about him?

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
For someone who has no idea of where he came from,

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
he can't die.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He can't die.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He can't die.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What about him?

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
For someone who has no idea of where he came from,

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Besides,

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not going to kill him.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm going to die with him.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Are you feeling better?

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't be afraid.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It'll be over soon.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll be fine.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll be with you.

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where's A'Kui?

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He's not here.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's not here.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He's not here.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is A'Kui back?

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
A'Kui?

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Mom.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Mom.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Mom.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
A'Kui.

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
A'Kui.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You still think about him in your heart?

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yaolan.

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Have you ever thought about me?

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
A'Kui is back.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Have you ever thought about me?

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
A'Kui is back.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
A'Kui.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A'Kui.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
A'Kui.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
A'Kui.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
A'Kui.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
A'Kui.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
A'Kui.

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
A'Kui.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
A'Kui.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
A'Kui.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
A'Kui.

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
A'Kui.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
A'Kui.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
A'Kui.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's him.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He's the one who wronged me.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He's the one who wronged me.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If he's good to me,

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
he should always be good to me.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If he can't do it, he shouldn't make promises.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He shouldn't approach me.

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He shouldn't let me trust him.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Didn't you say you wanted to die with Yaolan?

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But you only drank that bottle of water.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're scared.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're scared?

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Ning Rui Rui, you're a coward.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You don't deserve to be Yaolan's friend.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't understand.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You two are so close.

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Have you ever thought about what she thought before she died?

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What are you waiting for?

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If it weren't for you two,

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I would be with her now.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Ning Rui Rui,

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
when Liu Kui was here,

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
did you hear what she said?

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,680
No.

171
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,680
He just plays the guitar in his room.

172
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,000
He never leaves the room.

173
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,800
He doesn't talk to me.

174
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,720
Play the guitar?

175
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,440
So Liu Kui is really suspicious, right?

176
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm not wrong.

177
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,160
Liu Kui is suspicious.

178
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,680
Lan Lan, you should believe me.

179
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
I've been protecting you.

180
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,160
Why don't you believe me?

181
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,160
Liu Kui is really suspicious.

182
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,000
I knew he was suspicious.

183
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
He's really suspicious.

184
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
So I've been thinking about it.

185
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,120
Impossible.

186
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,560
Hello.

187
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,600
Mom.

188
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
You're back?

189
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,880
Just changed the star.

190
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
What were you and your brother got busy with?

191
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
You didn't even call me.

192
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
But I'm back.

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840
I miss you.

194
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,680
Okay.

195
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,720
Deqian.

196
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,360
Go straight to the dock.

197
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,440
According to Wu Cong,

198
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
he sold three horses to the same buyer.

199
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,400
The three trading locations

200
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,120
are Baima Town,

201
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Qilong Town and Luo County respectively.

202
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,880
These three towns

203
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,000
are in different directions in Taining City.

204
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,720
Yes.

205
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,240
So I transferred the surveillance of the three trading locations

206
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,880
to see if there was a single person

207
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
after Wu Cong left.

208
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,480
And I found him.

209
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,560
That's something.

210
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,200
Qi Chu.

211
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,240
Can you draw it out?

212
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,840
I think so.

213
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,640
I'll try.

214
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,880
Draw it out.

215
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,640
I'm thinking

216
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,000
if the buyer is related to the joint sale of the shares,

217
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,600
will he be related to Liu Kui?

218
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,960
Come on.

219
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,040
Qiang.

220
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
New knife and a batch of fire.

221
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,880
The quality is quite good.

222
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,280
Come on, Xiao Tao.

223
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,520
Open the lid.

224
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,680
Look at this.

225
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,520
It's pretty.

226
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,440
Liu Kui plays the guitar.

227
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,360
What are you talking about?

228
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,520
Do you remember

229
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,680
what he said

230
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,120
when he was interrogating Ning Rui?

231
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,200
He said he played the guitar in his room.

232
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,520
A suspect who was playing the guitar.

233
00:13:51,680 --> 00:14:04,080
Where did the

234
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,800
Where did the guitar go?

235
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,560
Before you went to Yao Lan's house that day,

236
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,200
did you almost catch Liu Kui?

237
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,440
What's the street called?

238
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,760
Jiu Long Xiang.

239
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,320
There's an instrument store over there.

240
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,080
Let's go.

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,600
How is it?

242
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,200
I checked the monitor.

243
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,680
Liu Kui's is the only one sold.

244
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:55,540
The

245
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,840
It's hard to get.

246
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,920
Come on, follow me.

247
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,840
Hurry up.

248
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,960
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,960
Toddy

250
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,920
No eating

251
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,520
No cell phone

252
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,700
No Labour

253
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,960
No exercise

254
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,040
No determ開心

255
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
The morning is coming

256
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,640
The unknown night flowers

257
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Remind me of the time

258
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
It's so confusing

259
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
In the wind

260
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Loneliness is opening up

261
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
The most distant place

262
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Is locked in my eyes

263
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
I change

264
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
A piece of grass

265
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
To stop here

266
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,640
And stop

267
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Is it satisfaction

268
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Or another kind of progress

269
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,640
I'm going into the mouth

270
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,640
To continue the endless journey

271
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Is there freedom ahead

272
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Or is it broken

273
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,640
I've crossed a few lines

274
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,640
I've crossed a few lines

275
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,640
And I'm starting to remember

276
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,640
The beginning of the journey

277
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,640
I've crossed a few lines

278
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,640
And I'm breaking a few books

279
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Until happiness

280
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Can't catch

281
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Can't keep

282
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I've crossed a few lines

283
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Until happiness

284
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Can't catch

285
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Can't keep

286
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Can't keep

287
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Can't keep

288
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Can't keep

289
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Can't keep

290
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Can't keep

291
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Can't keep

292
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
Can't keep

293
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Can't keep
