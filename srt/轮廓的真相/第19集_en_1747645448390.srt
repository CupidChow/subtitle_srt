Let them be obedient.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Later, call people, call them.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let them laugh, laugh.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you hear me?

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Boss,

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
look, there are so many today.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Very good.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Boys and girls all have.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The boy in white clothes.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Come.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Look here.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Look.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Say hello to uncle.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hello uncle.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
How about this?

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You look too smart.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Change another one.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, look again.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Come, you.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Look here.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000

Come.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Daiguang.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Where are you?

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Come.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Daiguang.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He waited at the gate of the charm palace for several days.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think he has a problem.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I brought him here.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I, I have no problem.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Say something.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I, I'm the charm palace.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Say it.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm from the Li's family.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Who's that?

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The Li's family.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He must have a problem.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What's the full name of Li Li?

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Li Li is Li Li.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't know.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm the boss of this high-ranking company.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's your name?

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Cui Jue.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How long have you been with Liu Kui?

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Liu Kui.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I, I don't know.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Who is Liu Kui?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You went to the charm palace to do something?

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What can I do if I'm on the train?

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You don't know, boss.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm on the train to the temple.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If I don't find the train, I'll die.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Where are the others?

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't know, boss.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What other people don't know?

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You, you're awake, boss.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Boss.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I, I, I'm not sleepy.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I still have to play.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you think I'm working?

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Boss, boss.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Are you awake?

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm tired.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I beg you, boss.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm not working.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm really tired, boss.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm really tired.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Boss.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Are you awake?

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Last night, the professional people said that it was not enough.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're so bold.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're a woman.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're good at watching TV.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're good at watching TV.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're good at watching TV.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Boss.

96

Boss.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Da Gong.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you running?

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Da Gong.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm ready.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What are you doing?

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Get up.

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Boss.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Where are you?

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Where are you, boss?

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Where are you, boss?

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Boss.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Have you searched all the treasures in the body?

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Are you sure?

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is there any phone?

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Come in.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hurry up.

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't waste your hope.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The kitchen is here.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We are here to eat.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You are the cook.

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When you're done,

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
someone will come to pick you up.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You are only allowed to work in this room.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You are not allowed to go to the East and West.

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I know everything.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You know?

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I know.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If you don't listen,

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll throw you into the sea to feed the fish.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't worry, Da Gong.

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Da Gong.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Please answer the phone.

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
My mother is waiting for me at home.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll call her to tell me if she's safe.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
One minute.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Good luck, Da Gong.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Good luck.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you, Da Gong.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll get it.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The workshop.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's listen together.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's go.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hello?

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hello?

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hello?

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Where are you?

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Where are you?

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Where are you?

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Go home.

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I know.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I found the way.

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm going back.

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What way?

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How much?

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You don't care.

161
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't care.

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The boss is so nice.

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll go home and smoke.

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are you sure?

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't forget to search the research center.

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Or you'll be pregnant tomorrow.

168
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm leaving.

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm going to work.

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Xiaoci.

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Good morning.

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll be right with you.

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's fine.

243
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I know what's going on with me.

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't wait for me.

245
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
I can't walk anymore.

246
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why are you awake?

248
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm afraid I can't come back.

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't worry.

250
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I will definitely come to pick you up this time.

251
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You lied.

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Be good.

253
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Go back.

254
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Go back quickly.

255
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Go back quickly.

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Go back quickly.

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm here.

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
How are you?

259
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm fine.

260
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You called her phone?

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I called her phone and called her.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm here.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm here.

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
She just called her man.

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I was standing next to her and staring.

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Nothing happened.

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Have you forgotten the rules?

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No.

275
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Give me your phone.

276
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hello, is Cui Jue here?

277
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The door is open.

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Come in.

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Come in.

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Do you know when she will come back?

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I won't come in.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Come in.

283
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You are here.

284
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Come in.

285
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Come in.

286
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Come in.

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Come in.

288
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm here.

289
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Good thing you are quick.

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
From now on,

291
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
turn off your phone.

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay.

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Come on.

295
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Da Guo.

296
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm here to see you.

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Come here.

298
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Bring the materials out.

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

300
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Zeyi.

301
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Bring it over there.

302
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay.

303
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Over there.

304
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Bring it over there.

305
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay.

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Gu Da.

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We found the car that took Qi Chu away.

308
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The car number is TIA M0427.

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It disappeared after the exit of Lu Hua Town,

310
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
which is very high speed.

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This girl is too risky.

312
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay.

313
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Keep following.

314
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Go to Lu Hua Town.

315
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Lu Hua Town.

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Do you remember what Qi Chu said on the phone?

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He said...

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The boss is still hiding.

319
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He will see the smoke soon.

320
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
He said he saw the smoke with that person.

321
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It should be the person we are looking for, Xu Honglai.

322
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And he didn't catch fish today.

323
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's bad for the world.

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
By the way,

325
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
don't forget to search the fish in the far away place.

326
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Otherwise,

327
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
we will be pregnant tomorrow.

328
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Fish.

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's where the fishermen fish boat.

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know if it's true.

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's true.

332
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The place where the fish boat is.

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't know if it's true.

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's bad tomorrow.

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It means we have to be late today.

336
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The team may be gone tomorrow.

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That's right.

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Call.

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Check those two phones.

340
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It must be turned off.

341
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hello, Lin Shen.

342
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Gu Da.

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Find all the fishermen near Lu Hua Town.

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And apply for support immediately.

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes.

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The phone is turned off.

347
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We can only rely on us.

348
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No.

349
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And Qi Chu.

350
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Qi Chu.

351
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yu Zi.

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hurry up.

353
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Hurry up.

354
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Don't waste time.

355
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm going.

356
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm going.

357
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Brother Da.

358
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Brother Cheng.

359
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Drink.

360
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Come.

361
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Come.

362
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What are you doing?

363
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Brother Da just said

364
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
he turned off his phone.

365
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Why did you take it out?

366
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I turned the fire off.

367
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What did you do?

368
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Xiao Tang.

369
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Xiao Zhao.

370
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Come and drink with the whole country.

371
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Sit down.

372
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Sit down.

373
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You've worked hard.

374
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Mom.

375
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going.

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm going.

377
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm going.

378
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm going.

379
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm going.

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm going.

381
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm going.

382
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm going.

383
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm going.

384
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm going.

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm going.

386
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm going.

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm going.

388
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm going.

389
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm going.

390
