00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,600
[A Perfect Match]

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,740
Tianxiang!

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,250
Why did you lie to me?

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,210
Do you know how much I love you?

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,400
Xiaonan.

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,700
Why are you here?

8
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,930
I know you're still angry,

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,330
but I want to explain it to you.

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,060
Actions speak louder than words.

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,060
No need to say more.

12
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,960
Then at least watch this.

13
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,360
Their company is in a mess.

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,430
Yes.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,700
They must be arguing right now.

16
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,200
They don't have the mood to practice.

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,200
We just need to wait for them to quit.

18
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,610
Then the tournament will announce our company as the substitute.

19
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,130
By then,

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,400
you can represent us in the competition.

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,000
That day,

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,130
Zhang Weixiong pretended to hurt his foot.

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,260
I felt sorry for him and took him home.

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,730
There's really nothing between us.

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,340
But I was afraid you'd misunderstand,

26
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,160
so I didn't tell you the truth.

27
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,860
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,960
So did I misunderstand you?

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,560
Do you...

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,330
still love me?

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,860
Of course I do.

32
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,100
So you're the sunshine boy in my dream.

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,230
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,950
I said, you're my dream lover.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,180
Before I met you,

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,350
I kept having the same dream.

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,260
In my dream,

38
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,690
I was at the beach, with a guy turning his back to me.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,090
I just realized that guy is you.

40
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,660
Really?

41
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,329
You suspect me?

42
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,260
Can you

43
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,800
stop being so mean to me?

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,900
You've been misunderstanding me.

45
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,329
Alright, I promise you.

46
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,900
I swear!

47
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,640
I'll take good care of Cheng Tianxiang.

48
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,590
I will protect you,

49
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,000
cherish you,

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,200
and guard you.

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,430
Forever!

52
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,030
You promised!

53
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,960
Xiaoruo, Tianxiang and I are going to the competition.

54
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,000
You're staying here with Tianxiang's Grandma.

55
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,200
You have to listen to Grandma

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,600
and Qianqian, got it?

57
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,860
Yes.

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,100
Good girl, Xiaoruo.

59
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,000
Wow.

60
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,270
-Sorry I'm late!
-Qianqian.

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,579
Sorry, baby.

62
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,470
Don't leave, please.

63
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,160
You're using a Doris suitcase?

64
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,760
I bought it.

65
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,500
You have good taste.

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,940
Both of you.

67
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,400
Tianxiang prepared it for me.

68
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,760
Let me tell you,

69
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm a big fan of Doris suitcases.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,530
I need to show you how to use it,

71
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,330
so you don't mess up when you travel abroad.

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,840
See, it's super spacious

73
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,710
and easy to pack.

74
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,650
These are two different things.

75
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,650
It can hold a lot things

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,649
because it has a fifth wheel in the middle.

77
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,269
It's super sturdy

78
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,420
and won't deform even with

79
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,550
heavy loads.

80
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,500
And look,

81
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,450
there's a red spring inside.

82
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,190
That's the shock absorber.

83
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,970
What suitcase has shock absorbers on wheels?

84
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,380
But this suitcase does,

85
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,659
to enhance its load capacity.

86
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,060
Plus, it has a brake system on it.

87
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,420
So when you're on the bus

88
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,100
or train, just step on it,

89
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,130
and it won't slide around.

90
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,300
It'll stay put.

91
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,300
Isn't that amazing?

92
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:43,820
Ah.

93
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,640
This is the PRO version, right?

94
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,560
-Yes.
-The PRO version

95
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,870
has a special

96
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,800
front compartment

97
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,159
that opens easily by its zipper,

98
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,120
so you can grab whatever you need

99
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,510
anytime, anywhere, without unpacking

100
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,659
everything

101
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,490
and making a mess.

102
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,620
Qianqian could totally be a Doris salesperson.

103
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,820
I just haven't applied, okay?

104
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
If I did, I'd be the top salesperson globally.

105
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,120
Yes. If you keep talking, we'll be late.

106
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,370
I just don't want to leave you.

107
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,760
Grandma.

108
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,830
I'll leave Xiaoruo to you and Qianqian.

109
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,760
No problem.

110
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,860
Don't worry.

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,160
I will take good care of them.

112
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,160
You can rest assured.

113
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,760
Just leave Xiaoruo to me and Qianqian.

114
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,960
Go now.

115
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,300
Bye.

116
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,760
Wait.

117
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,600
Lin Xiaonan.

118
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,200
Don't you dare bully Cheng Tianxiang.

119
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,130
If you make my baby cry,

120
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,330
sad or upset,

121
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,300
I'll fly over and deal with you myself.

122
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,620
Okay, I got it.

123
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,040
And I'm confident we'll bring back the championship.

124
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,530
Come on, the car's leaving.

125
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,060
Tianxiang,

126
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,160
after the competition,

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,460
let's get married.

128
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,730
Marry him!

129
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,100
Okay.

130
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,360
But I have one condition.

131
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,140
One condition?

132
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,210
We have to win the championship.

133
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
For sure.

134
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,390
[Asian Cup Tennis Champion]

135
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,590
Half a year later, we finally won

136
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,100
the Asian Cup Doubles Championship.

137
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,560
And Xiaonan and I became a real family.

138
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,600
Xiaonan, Xiaoruo and Grandma are getting along well.

139
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,940
And my best friend Qianqian

140
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,060
finally found her true love.

141
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,830
Our family of four is about to start

142
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,400
our happy life together.
