[A Perfect Match]

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,700
I heard that

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,250
you were late

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,500
because you saved my sister.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,620
Is that little girl your sister?

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,530
Yes.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,700
What a coincidence.

9
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,660
So, I think

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,130
I should say thank you.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,760
You don't have to thank me.

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,900
Your sister was almost hit by a car on the street.

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,900
Everyone would help.

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,930
How about this?

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,460
I want to invite you

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,299
to come to our company for another interview.

17
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,580
Are you willing to take the opportunity?

18
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,830
Yes.

19
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,860
Of course.

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,660
Thank you.

21
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,800
Thank you, too.

22
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,760
If the interview goes well,

23
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,800
welcome to join our tennis team.

24
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,330
No problem.

25
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,100
I will try my best to pass the interview.

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,200
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

27
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,060
Excuse me.

28
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,800
Hello, Xiaoruo.

29
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,560
Stay at home.

30
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll be home soon,

31
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,860
okay?

32
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,760
Tianxiang has his own business to attend to.

33
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,160
We can't disturb him.

34
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,260
Good girl, take your time.

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,850
I'll buy you ice cream later,

36
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,660
okay?

37
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,130
What happened?

38
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,360
Xiaoruo is in a bad mood.

39
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,300
She wants to see you.

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
I'll talk to her first.

41
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,990
Good girl,

42
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,100
take your time.

43
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,100
Let me check on her.

44
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,100
Xiaoruo is finally asleep.

45
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,330
I'll go back first.

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,699
Wait.

47
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,000
Have a drink with me.

48
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,800
Okay.

49
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,100
Besides me,

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,600
you are the first person Xiaoruo would talk to.

51
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,700
Is she usually like this?

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,730
I believe you can see

53
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,930
Xiaoruo is emotionally unstable.

54
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,300
She relies on me very much.

55
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,000
She's also the person I can't let go of the most.

56
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,060
Well.

57
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,930
She was very cheerful when she was young.

58
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:57,400
How did she become like this?

59
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,860
Xiaoruo and I

60
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,730
came from a violent family.

61
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,460
My parents always hit me.

62
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,400
Xiaoruo was young.

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,900
So, I couldn't let her grow up in such an environment.

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
One day,

65
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,130
I got the money ready

66
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,460
and was about to take Xiaoruo away.

67
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,660
My parents were killed by a car in front of me.

68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,329
It's all in the past.

69
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,510
If Xiaoruo needs any help,

70
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,660
just tell me.

71
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm willing to help you,

72
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,060
okay?

73
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,260
Thank you.

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
Forget it.

75
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,060
Let's

76
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,760
play tennis together tomorrow, okay?

77
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,260
Okay.

78
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,730
Great.

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,730
Okay.

80
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,690
Come on.

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,860
Cheers.

82
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,800
Let's drink to eliminate our sorrows.

83
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,680
Where am I?

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,260
Why am I sleeping here?

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What happened?

86
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,900
You...

87
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,330
You...

88
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,030
Did you do anything to me

89
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,100
last night?

90
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,600
What are you thinking?

91
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,600
Why am I naked?

92
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,860
You were drunk last night.

93
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,360
You vomited all over.

94
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,930
I washed your clothes and put them there.

95
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,290
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,200
Haha.

97
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,480
I forgot to tell you

98
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,150
that I couldn't hold my liquor.

99
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,500
Hurry up to wash up and get out for breakfast.

100
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,200
Hurry up.

101
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,200
Good morning.

102
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,430
Come and try it.

103
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,400
This is what I made.

104
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,570
You made all this?

105
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,260
Try it.

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,600
Do you know burnt food will cause cancer?

107
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,400
I don't think so.

108
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,200
Have a try.

109
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,280
No, thanks.

110
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,230
Xiaoruo,

111
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,720
do you eat something like this every day?

112
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,720
I'll make your breakfast.

113
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,500
Wait for me.

114
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,870
Here you are.

115
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,930
Wow, great!

116
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,560
Wow, I didn't expect

117
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,020
you are good at cooking.

118
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,570
Yes.

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,900
It's delicious.

120
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,030
It's delicious.

121
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,100
I have something to discuss with you.

122
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,159
What?

123
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,850
Besides inviting you to the company for an interview,

124
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,200
I also want you to be Xiaoruo's nurse.

125
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,200
What?

126
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,860
Don't worry.

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,930
I will pay you.

128
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,730
What should I do?

129
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,560
Someone will take care of her during the daytime.

130
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,500
You only have to accompany her during holidays and after work.

131
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,600
Are you willing to do it?

132
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,930
I will think about it.

133
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,900
Let's talk about something else.

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,710
Didn't you say that you are good at playing tennis?

135

Let's play tennis

136
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,530

I didn't expect

140
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,150
you are so good at playing tennis.

141
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,960
I told you.

142
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,590
Welcome to our tennis team

if you are hired by our company.

145
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,330
Maybe we can play in doubles.

146

Really?
