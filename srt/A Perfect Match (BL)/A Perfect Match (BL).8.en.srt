I heard you two arguing outside.

Qianqian bullied me.

31
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,400
She took my remote.

32
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,330
How could I take your remote?

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,850
She wronged me.

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,810
Xiaoruo, Qianqian is already

35
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,660

-Yes.
-I'm not old.

Oh, right.

40

You two have been gone for so long.

42
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,440
You practice until so late every day.

43
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,860
No wonder you've made it to the final.

44
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:56,200
Of course. We're the best partners, right?
