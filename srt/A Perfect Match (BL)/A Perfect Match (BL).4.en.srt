Told you.

00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,700

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,530
We could even play doubles together.

Really?

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,800
Yes.

Where's the tea?

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,800
Why do I

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,160

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,400

Or are you crazy?

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,860
How could you have a crush on a straight guy?

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,220
Are you out of your mind?

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,660
Never get involved with straight guys.

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,800
Never get involved with straight guys.

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,930
What?

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,330
Is there something on my face?

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,930
Is there anything on my face?

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,800
No.

29
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,100

I'm sorry.

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,360
I may not be suitable for your company.

34

I went to see Qianqian yesterday.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,000
We talked so late that I ended up sleeping over.

39
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,500
I forgot to tell you.

40
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,700
It's okay.

How was the interview?

42

It was okay,

43
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,130
but I don't think that company is right for me.

44
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,060
Grandma, I'm sorry.

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,960
I might have to find another job.

46
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,230
It's okay.

47
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,200
It takes time to find a job.

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,000
I gotta go.

I forgot to tell you.

51

I took on another cleaning job,

52
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,420
so

53
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,100
I can't stay home with you today.

We can't disturb him.

62
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,500
Then take me to him.

63

I had no choice

76
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,700
but to come to you.

77
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,130
Could you please go with me?

78
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,760
It might not be convenient.

Sorry.

85
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000

86
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,660
be able to agree.

87
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,730
