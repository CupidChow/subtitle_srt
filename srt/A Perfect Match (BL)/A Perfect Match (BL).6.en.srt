[A Perfect Match]

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,930
Where is Xiaoruo?

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,530
Let's go over there.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,600
Xiaoruo!

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,830
Xiaoruo!

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,060
Xiaoruo.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,230
Xiaoruo.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,400
Xiaoruo.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,290
Xiaoruo.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,820
Why did you come out again?

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,420
Xiaoruo.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,800
Didn't you promise me to stay at home?

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,600
I...

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,100
I came out to look for Tianxiang.

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,330
Me?

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,560
-Are you alright?
-Tianxiang!

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,830
Tianxiang!

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,360
Don't cry.

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,430
Are you hurt?

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,130
I'm glad you're fine.

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Let's go home, okay?

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,100
[Parent-child relationships are important, but one also needs some private time.]

24
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,730
Jiang.

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,760
Okay.

26
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,460
I'll report to you tomorrow.

27
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,459
Weixiong baby.

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,760
What are you doing?

29
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,860
Why are you still using your phone?

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,610
Act like a man, okay?

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,200
You're so slow.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,600
What's wrong with you?

33
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,330
Are you done?

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,400
What did you say?

35
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,760
I've had enough of this!

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,830
You eat my food,

37
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,400
use my stuff,

38
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,530
and sleep in my bed.

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,530
So what if I complain a little?

40
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,970
I'm done catering to you.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,930
Fine.

42
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,560
Get lost.

43
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,830
My pursuers are lining up to Paris.

44
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,880
Good.

45
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,460
Go to Paris and find another sucker.

46
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,360
Zhang Weixiong!

47
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,930
I'm going to tell Dad.

48
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,560
I won't go to the company either.

49
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,850
You jerk!

50
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,270
Tianxiang,

51
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:56,200
you can't leave me alone anymore.

52
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,479
Be a good girl,

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,090
and I won't leave you alone.

54
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,340
Okay, I'll listen to you.

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,530
I won't run around again.

56
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,430
Tianxiang.

57
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,100
Tianxiang.

58
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,930
Let's go home.

59
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,030
No.

60
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,360
Why would I go back with you?

61
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
So they really...

62
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,630
were together.

63
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,450
Alright.

64
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,190
I was wrong.

65
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,500
I shouldn't have treated you this way.

66
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,400
I realize you're the right one for me.

67
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,140
Let's make up.

68
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:22,730
Let go of me.

69
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,300
Let go.

70
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,320
Tianxiang is mine.

71
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,360
Who are you?

72
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,890
Xiaoruo is my sister.

73
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,850
Her words

74
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,140
are my words.

75
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,960
Zhang Weixiong,

76
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,630
you'd better leave us alone.

77
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,829
Xiaoruo,

78
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,760
let's go home.

79
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,020
Tianxiang.

80
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,630
Let's go.

81
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,800
Tianxiang.

82
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
Tianxiang!

83
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,400
Xiaoruo is asleep.

84
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
I'll go back first.

85
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,530
Tianxiang,

86
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,590
if you have nothing else,

87
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,430
stay here for a bit.

88
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,660
I can't.

89
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,230
What's wrong?

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,460
I really appreciate

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
what you did for Grandma,

92
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,400
but I can't keep

93
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
taking care of Xiaoruo anymore.

94
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,829
Why do you say that?

95
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,360
Because I might have...

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,030
fallen for you.

97
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,460
When you weren't around these past few days,

98
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,860
I kept thinking about you.

99
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,660
I know you're straight,

100
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,860
but I'm afraid I'll fall deeper and deeper.

101
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,760
So I'm sorry.

102
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,260
Tianxiang!

103
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,600
Why are you here?

104
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,290
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,230
I was wrong.

106
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,200
Please forgive me. I love you.

107
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,070
You're already with Li Na.

108
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,230
What else do you want?

109
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,730
Stop talking about her.

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,470
She doesn't treat me like a man.

111
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,060
I've broken up with her.

112
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,430
You're way better.

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,560
Are you done?

114
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,360
By the way,

115
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,860
I recently became the general manager of a new company.

116
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,930
They have a tennis team.

117
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,940
I can make you the main player.

118
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,430
Let's go back to playing tennis like we used to.

119
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
Zhang Weixiong,

120
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,530
trying to be the good guy after a breakup

121
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,530
is the worst thing you can do.

122
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,430
I don't care.

123
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,530
I miss you.

124
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,060
You have nothing to do with me anymore.

125
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,200
My world doesn't

126
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,560
need you anymore.

127
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,330
Tianxiang!

128
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,400
Tianxiang!

129
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,760
Tianxiang and I were together before,

130
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,760
but we just had to take a break for some reasons.

131
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,460
I love him,

132
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,060
and he must love me too.

133
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,000
So don't take it too seriously.

134
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,100
He's just playing with you.

135
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,060
Tianxiang isn't mine.

136
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,060
Why should I give him to you?

137
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,230
Besides,

138
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,610
love isn't something

139
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,200
you can just hand over.

140
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,160
So,

141
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,700
you're...

142
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,060
not together?

143
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,350
I said no.

144
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,560
Whatever you think.

145
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,330
How about this?

146
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,430
Let's have a match.

147
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,600
What kind of match?

148
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,880
A tennis match.

149
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,159
If you win,

150
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,730
I'll leave him.

151
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,659
But if you lose,

152
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,400
you leave him alone.

153
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,460
Let's do it!

154
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Tianxiang,

155
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,159
I will definitely win the game.

156
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,930
From now on,

157
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,760
I will protect you

158
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,860
and won't let you get hurt again.

159
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,730
It seems

160
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,630
I have to...

161
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Tianxiang!

162
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,990
What?

163
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,960
You lost.

164
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,830
What are you doing?

165
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,240
That doesn't count.

166
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,440
I'm not giving Tianxiang

167
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,200
to a tennis loser like you.

168
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,910
Who are you calling a loser?

169
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,440
I'm talking about you.

170
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,930
If you won fair and square,

171
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,800
I'd give Tianxiang to you.

172
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,060
I should've known you'd go back on your word.

173
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,659
I shouldn't have played with you.

174
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,200
Who said I go back on my word?

175
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,880
Then give Tianxiang to me.

176
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:39,960
I don't agree!

177
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,200
Why do you take me as your bargaining chip?

178
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,630
I'm a person,

179
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,860
not an object!

180
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,670
You can't just hand me over!

181
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,659
Tianxiang.

182
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,030
Tianxiang!

183
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,530
Will you listen to me?

184
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,530
I don't want to.

185
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,430
I just care about you too much.

186
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,830
You care about me?
