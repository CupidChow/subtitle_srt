00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,330
Come on.

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,660
Try it.

7
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,600
See if the braised pork I cooked is delicious.

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,540
-How's it?
-Wow.

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,970
This is the best braised pork I've ever had.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,530
Really? Good.

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,900
Let's give this one

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,480

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,060
You can have all the rest, okay?

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,360
-Okay.
-Okay.

15
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,759
You can't just eat meat.

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,700
Eat some vegetables.

Xiaoruo isn't the only one who can't leave Tianxiang.

19
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,330
I

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,160
can't leave him, either.

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,000
Why?

22
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,260
Why do I

23
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,560
have a different feeling about Tianxiang?

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,870
Xiaonan, let me take a shower.

25
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:08,920
Okay.

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,400

Scalp care spray.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,890
It's a no-rinse serum.

29
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,800
This looks good.

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,300
Let me secretly use it later.

31
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,460
Scalp care spray.

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,060

On scalp.

36
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,250
Did I spray it on my scalp?

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,630
Yes, I think so.

38
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,449
Tianxiang,

39
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,840

You idiot!

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,030
Why did you close your eyes?

45
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,200
Why?

46
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,500
No way.

47
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,300
Did I fall in love with him?

48
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,630
No.

49
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,260
Are you serious?

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,660
You are sick.

51
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,300

What should I do?

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,740
You asked me what to do?

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,930
I don't know.

55
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,930
I told you not to be in this way.

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,329
Why are you so lovesick?

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,620
Why are you like me?

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,400
I don't care.

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,260
Help me think of a solution.

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,380
I don't know!

You fell in love with a straight man.

62
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,829
A straight man.

63
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,230
Why did you fall in love with a straight man?

64
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,480
There are so many gays,

65
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,230

66
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,329
Don't look at me like that.

67

75
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,530
And most importantly,

76
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,570
don't go to his house to take care of his sister.

77
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,200
No way.

78
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,530

Stop thinking about others.

81

Think about yourself.

82

You can't even take care of yourself.

83
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,930
How can you care about others?

84
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200

-Why didn't you finish the sentence?
-There is a call.

112

-Grandma can be discharged now.

117

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,900
No, I'm not!

121
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,120
It's more comfortable to stay at home.

122
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,300
The hospital is full of the smell of disinfectant.

123
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
It stinks.

124
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320

you didn't sleep well when you were in the hospital.

142
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,120

did you find a job?

168

Grandma, you just recovered.

169
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,930
You can't let anything go wrong.

He's worried that you'll be lonely at home.

179
