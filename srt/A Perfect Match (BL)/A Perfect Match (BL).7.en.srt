[A Perfect Match]

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tianxiang,

4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,400
listen to me, okay?

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,500
No!

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,310
Can you give me a chance to explain?

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,930
It's not necessary.

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,000
In your eyes, I'm just a chip,

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,560
and a tool.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,300
It's not what you think.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,360
Then, what?

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,400
I really care about you.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,130
You care about me?

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,960
I was confident that I would win.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,460
Did you win?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,290
The result doesn't matter.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,260
What matters is

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,600
I've fallen in love with you.

19
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,810
Aren't you...

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,160
What are you doing?

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,300
Grandma!

22
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,000
Tianxiang, tell me.

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,480
Did you prostitute yourself

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,930
to raise me?

25
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,699
No, Grandma.

26
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,700
This is not the case.

27
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,700
Grandma,

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,660
they're not in that kind of relationship.

29
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,900
What I saw in the park was fake, huh?

30
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,460
No.

31
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not a bad relationship.

32
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,250
Then, what is it?

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,400
Tell me.

34
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,200
What's your relationship?

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,300
Say it yourself.

36
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,130
Grandma,

37
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,329
that's not the case.

38
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,060
Tianxiang

39
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,560
never did anything wrong.

40
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,329
I love Tianxiang.

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,460
I promise

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,190
I will protect him forever.

43
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,730
Cool.

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Grandma.

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,930
Do you

46
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,460
really love me?

47
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,460
Or are you just curious?

48
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,130
I love you.

49
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,730
Really?

50
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,960
Do I look like a liar?

51
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,000
A little.

52
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,260
No more again.

53
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,080
Hey.

54
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,000
Where is he?

55
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,730
What smells so good?

56
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,980
Here you are.

57
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,870
It's hot. Be careful.

58
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,600
Wow, the breakfast you made is delicious,

59
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,800
unlike what my brother did.

60
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,300
Unlike what?

61
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,690
Unlike the burnt bread you baked.

62
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,200
It tasted bitter.

63
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,330
You mentioned

64
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,780
Tianxiang a lot.

65
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,940
I'll get mad if you keep doing this.

66
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,300
Xiaonan, don't be angry.

67
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,410
I like Tianxiang

68
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,400
but I love you more!

69
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,210
Really?

70
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,130
Yes.

71
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,730
Stop teasing her.

72
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,960
Try it.

73
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,960
See if you like it.

74
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,560
Wow, it's delicious.

75
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,600
This is the taste of happiness.

76
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,130
You two love each other.

77
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,960
I'm not afraid that no one will accompany me anymore,

78
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,700
Tianxiang,

79
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,330
stay with me forever.

80
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,200
No problem.

81
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,760
But you have to be good.

82
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,120
Okay. As long as you accompany me,

83
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,960
I'll be good.

84
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,330
Good girl.

85
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,460
We are not busy at work lately.

86
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,900
What are you going to do after dinner?

87
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,700
I told you

88
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,170
not to talk about work after work.

89
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,330
Didn't we say

90
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,330
we're going to play basketball later?

91
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,460
I want to go with you guys.

92
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,660
Nope.

93
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,660
Haha.

94
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,300
Grandma.

95
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,700
Grandma.

96
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,530
Tianxiang, come back with Xiaonan.

97
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm not that old-fashioned.

98
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,360
I can accept the love of two men.

99
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,300
If you really love each other,

100
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,560
I have no reason to get in your way.

101
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,460
I sincerely wish you well.

102
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,000
But you have to promise me

103
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,700
that you won't let Tianxiang down.

104
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,660
Grandma, trust me.

105
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,260
I'll treat Tianxiang well.

106
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,860
Thank you, Grandma.

107
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,060
Alright.

108
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,730
Cheer up.

109
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,760
Haha.

110
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,960
Haha.
