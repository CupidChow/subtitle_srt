=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,376
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,790
There are two more boxes
of ancient books

4
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:41,351
in the backyard.

5
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,230
It's getting pretty late.

6
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,991
Anyway, you can't find any clues
about the developing water at once.

7
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,831
Tomorrow, you'll go out of the city
to find Mr. Ouyang.

8
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:53,670
So you should rest now.

9
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,351
If you're sleepy, go to bed.

10
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,510
I'll read.

11
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:01,670
I'll get you a pot of tea

12
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,670
and some pastries.

13
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:04,191
Tianhao.

14
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,911
Remember to buy some snacks tomorrow.

15
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,191
The trip will take days.

16
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,710
I'm worried Miss Shen won't
be used to eating outside.

17
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,911
Okay.

18
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:17,631
Never mind, I'll do it myself.

19
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,790
You don't know what Danqing likes.

20
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:41,871
Danqing.

21
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:45,390
Small crisp pastries.

22
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,591
Songye crisp pastries.

23
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:50,151
Surely one of them
is Danqing's favorite.

24
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,230
Zishan, you're sweating.

25
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,151
Let me wipe the sweat.

26
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:58,591
Thank you.

27
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:00,031
Danqing.

28
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,031
General, how come you're here?

29
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,591
I just finished my work

30
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:04,631
and came by to see you.

31
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:06,510
Zishan is here too.

32
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,950
He can help you take care of the winery.

33
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:10,311
We can travel without worry.

34
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,990
I bought you pastries

35
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,830
for the road.

36
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,071
Zishan is going with us.

37
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:14,871
Zishan also...

38
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,591
You're going too?

39
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:19,830
The Escort Agency
has no pressing business.

40
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,631
After Danqing
and I finish the work at the winery,

41
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:23,071
we will go to find you together.

42
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,071
General, you may go back.

43
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:27,510
We'll see you tonight.

44
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,311
What? Danqing.

45
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,670
Chengfeng, what pastries did you buy?

46
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,751
Are there any I like?

47
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,151
They are all your favorites.

48
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,031
See you.

49
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:47,466
(The Grave of Du Ruoshan)

50
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,071
You mean

51
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:53,710
Ruoshan's death was caused
by the Luo family?

52
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:55,431
Ruoshan was healthy.

53
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:58,790
But he died
after spending a night at their house.

54
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:02,110
Though the authorities have adjudicated,
I can't accept it.

55
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,751
How could I
let the Luo family get away with it?

56
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:08,591
Mr. Du, why don't you go
and reason with the Luo family again?

57
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,031
A life for a life.

58
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,591
They can't escape.

59
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,110
They have paid the price for the murder.

60
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,071
Luo Jida was killed
by his beloved daughter, Luo Ailian.

61
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,390
Later, Luo Ailian somehow got burned
to death in the ancestral hall.

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,350
(The Grave of Du Ruoshan)

63
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,950
They got what they deserved.

64
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:29,671
I think

65
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:32,671
my son Ruoshan was bewitched
by Luo Ailian.

66
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,991
That's why he died.

67
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,350
Luo Ailian.

68
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,590
My son died.

69
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,071
Luo Jida's daughters ended up bad.

70
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,270
So my son may rest in peace.

71
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:48,470
Luo Jida has three daughters.

72
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,470
One of them is dead.

73
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,551
One of them is missing.

74
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,431
And the last one
has become a tavern maid.

75
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,030
A tavern maid?

76
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,270
I hear she has fallen to the point
of selling liquor at Zuiyun Tower.

77
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:02,671
A tavern maid at Zuiyun Tower?

78
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:04,830
Thank you for helping me out just now.

79
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:07,030
I'm Luo Xue'er, 21 years old.

80
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,311
Should call you with the honorific?

81
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:12,431
The Luo family?

82
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,350
Mr. Du, what's her name?

83
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:17,390
Luo Jida's second daughter
is Luo Xue'er.

84
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:32,470
Catch the thief!

85
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,671
- Someone is stealing!
- Get away.

86
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:34,231
You're stealing.

87
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:35,590
- Let go of me!
- Give it to me.

88
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,231
- My purse!
- Give it back to me.

89
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:38,871
Go away!

90
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,071
You win.

91
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,390
Are you alright?

92
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,191
Make way!

93
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,991
I'm fine.

94
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,270
Your purse.

95
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,551
Thank you.

96
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:49,551
I am Luo Xue'er.

97
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:50,590
Do you still remember me?

98
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,390
I didn't expect to see you again.

99
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,551
Yes, indeed, it's unexpected.

100
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:00,751
Are you free now?

101
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,590
I have something I want to ask you.

102
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:19,830
Ying'er, you said you had something
to ask me.

103
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:21,030
What is it?

104
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:23,071
Well,

105
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,710
are you the second daughter
of the Luo Family in Liao City?

106
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:36,950
One more question.

107
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,710
Am I good to you?

108
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:42,910
Of course, you are.

109
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:44,871
Ever since my family declined,

110
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,791
I've been humiliated and scorned.

111
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,470
They all treat me as a maid.

112
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,871
But you treat me well.

113
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:53,710
Good.

114
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,871
I have something else to ask you.

115
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,510
You mustn't lie to me.

116
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,551
Okay.

117
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:05,671
Do you remember Du Ruoshan?

118
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:08,551
Mr. Du?

119
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:11,830
Why did you ask about him?

120
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,150
Tell me how Du Ruoshan died.

121
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:17,470
Was it Luo Ailian who killed him?

122
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,231
Or was it someone from your Luo family?

123
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,311
It wasn't me, Ying'er.

124
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:21,470
It has nothing to do with me.

125
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:24,671
To be honest,

126
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:27,791
Du Ruoshan was my distant cousin

127
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:33,071
and also the man I liked.

128
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,991
If you have a conscience,
tell me the truth of his death.

129
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,751
After all, I saved you once.

130
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,111
(I see.)

131
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,191
(If I share an enemy with her,)

132
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,431
(she and I will be friends.)

133
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,830
It was Luo Ailian.

134
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,791
She was jealous that Mr. Du
liked my little sister.

135
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:55,231
So she pretended to be Shuangshuang
and met with Mr. Du at midnight.

136
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,950
But Mr. Du disliked her.

137
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,470
In the midst of their argument,
he died of palpitations.

138
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,830
Luo Ailian.

139
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,671
It was actually her.

140
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:12,030
If you know the truth,
why not explain it to the authorities?

141
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:14,791
To be honest,

142
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,431
my mother was a concubine.

143
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:19,470
Luo Ailian threatened me.

144
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,231
If I turned her in, she would kill me.

145
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,231
My father refused to cover up for her

146
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,150
and made her marry Mr. Du
as a form of apology to the Du family.

147
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,830
I can't believe
she ruthlessly murdered my father.

148
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,990
Later, the ancestral hall caught fire,

149
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,191
and she perished in the flames.

150
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,271
A fire burnt all the evidence
and witnesses to ashes.

151
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,391
Then the authorities closed the case.

152
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,031
So that was the true story.

153
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,710
Since Luo Ailian is already dead,

154
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,350
she has paid the price.

155
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,110
Ying'er.

156
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,511
Will you shun me

157
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,191
because I'm from the Luo family?

158
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,671
I do hate Luo Ailian.

159
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:06,350
But I'm sure of one thing.

160
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:07,870
You're not her.

161
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,311
You are you.

162
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,950
I won't take my anger out on you.

163
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,990
Thank you, Ying'er.

164
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:16,431
I've been overlooked
because of my background.

165
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,870
And I have very few friends.

166
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:21,791
So I'm happy to be friends with you.

167
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:27,271
Not all my friends are loyal to me.

168
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,911
They just follow me for the benefits.

169
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,671
I have a friend
who grew up with me in Liao City.

170
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,671
She is the young lady
of the Shen Escort Agency,

171
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,870
Shen Danqing.

172
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,551
So you and Miss Shen
are childhood friends.

173
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:42,271
Exactly.

174
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:45,750
She has never thought
about gaining any advantage from me

175
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,031
and has even saved my life.

176
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,071
She is my true friend.

177
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:53,990
And now you're my true friend too.

178
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,110
I hope we can be best friends.

179
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,615
(Refreshing Wind)

180
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,151
Miss, you're back.

181
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,071
The clothes
you ordered for Miss Du are ready.

182
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:27,950
Here they are.

183
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,470
Okay, I'll take them to her.

184
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,271
Okay.

185
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,271
Young Master.

186
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:33,911
Tianhao came by earlier,

187
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:36,391
saying that General Xu
has important things to say to you.

188
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,470
He asked me to give this letter to you.

189
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,071
Okay, you may go.

190
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:42,110
Yes.

191
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,990
Ying'er.

192
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:10,470
The pink silk
you liked has been made into clothes.

193
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,551
Here they are.

194
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:12,990
Danqing, please sit.

195
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,391
What are you doing?

196
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:16,271
Embroidering a purse?

197
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:20,271
I wanna give up.

198
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:22,671
I thought it wasn't too difficult
and decided

199
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:23,590
to do it myself.

200
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,110
My fingers have been pricked
a million times.

201
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,311
but I fail to finish it.

202
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,230
Let me have a look.

203
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,950
Danqing, my purse was stolen today.

204
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:42,511
Luckily, a girl got it back for me.

205
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,830
However, the purse was broken.

206
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,311
Did you get hurt?

207
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,511
Don't worry. I'm fine.

208
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,870
However, it led me to make a new friend.

209
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,391
New friend?

210
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,750
That's good.

211
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,151
I was worried before.

212
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:00,710
I have to leave for days with Zishan,

213
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,151
so you will be here alone.

214
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,590
I won't see you for several days?

215
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,071
Alright, I'll be back soon.

216
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:10,311
Tell me about your new friend.

217
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:15,391
She's a tavern maid at the Zuiyun Tower.
Her name is Luo Xue'er.

218
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:19,311
Danqing, you've pricked your finger.

219
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,191
Are you alright?

220
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,671
It's okay.

221
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,470
Luo Xue'er?

222
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,230
Yes, she helped me
retrieve my purse today.

223
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:32,990
Danqing.

224
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:36,710
Xue'er is making a living
as a tavern maid at the Zuiyun Tower.

225
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:38,311
You own a winery.

226
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:40,750
If possible, could you help her?

227
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,151
Sure, I will definitely help her.

228
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,230
You are so kind.

229
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:55,151
Luo Xue'er has become friends
with Ying'er?

230
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,151
What's she up to?

231
00:12:58,551 --> 00:12:59,391
I don't know yet.

232
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,191
But judging by Ying'er's look,

233
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:03,990
she seems to know nothing of the thing
between me and Luo Xue'er.

234
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,671
Luo Xue'er is clever and perceptive.

235
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,230
She must be aware of the relationship
between Ying'er and me.

236
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,791
So she's thinking of how to exploit it.

237
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,671
If I rashly let Ying keep away from her,

238
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:15,350
it might arouse Ying'er's aversion.

239
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,311
In that case,
it would all be for naught.

240
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,791
If Luo Xue'er doesn't
make the first move,

241
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:22,350
you can't strike first.

242
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,431
It will also provoke
Ying'er's resentment.

243
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:27,911
Ying'er is kind-hearted.

244
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,830
I don't want her to get involved.

245
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,551
She is an innocent girl.

246
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,630
I'm afraid
that in a state of being deceived,

247
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:36,950
she might reveal my things
to Luo Xue'er.

248
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:39,671
It'll be a danger
if Ying'er stays in Liao City.

249
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:41,710
To avoid unnecessary complications,

250
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:43,830
it's best to send her away.

251
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:48,350
She came here to sell jades.

252
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,990
If her jades are sold,

253
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:53,191
she will surely have to go back.

254
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,630
That is a solution.

255
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:58,350
I'll let someone disguise as a merchant
and buy all of her jades.

256
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,271
I'll advise her to spend more time
at the market.

257
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,870
Miss.

258
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,431
Young Master, Miss.

259
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,191
How is the investigation going?

260
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:10,630
According to your instructions,

261
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,110
I went to look for the butler
of the Xiao family.

262
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:16,350
But the butler has passed away
due to old age.

263
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,431
Now, the people who know
about this are their old servants.

264
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,950
These old servants left
after the Xiao family was estranged.

265
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:23,511
It's difficult to find them now.

266
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,071
I still need some time.

267
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,191
That's the only way it can be.

268
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,191
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

269
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:31,911
It seems the matter is thorny.

270
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,071
I'll give you more men.

271
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:35,750
Resolve this matter as soon as possible

272
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:37,350
Yes, Young Master.

273
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,830
I have something else to do.

274
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:45,551
I'll see you later.

275
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:46,630
Okay.

276
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,431
General Xu, what do you ask me here for?

277
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:05,990
Sit.

278
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,870
Zishan, how long has it been
since the two of us drank together?

279
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,350
General Xu, please speak frankly.

280
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,710
I believe
that man will triumph over fate.

281
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:23,271
Even if it's forced,
there must be a good outcome.

282
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:28,870
But I've realized
that feelings cannot be forced.

283
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:32,151
Today, when I saw you with Danqing,

284
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,630
she looked so happy.

285
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:35,710
I was quite envious.

286
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,710
I should be the one saying that.

287
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:50,750
Danqing knows your feelings for her.

288
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:53,750
And she still sees me as a brother.

289
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,990
She's never noticed my feelings for her.

290
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,151
Wait.

291
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,950
You and I are romantic rivals.

292
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,311
You shouldn't have told me that.

293
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:05,990
That's exactly why I wanted to tell you.

294
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,950
If you're a nobody,

295
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:11,710
I won't let him get the slightest chance
to approach Danqing.

296
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,110
But my opponent is you.

297
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,311
You are an opponent worthy
of my respect and candidness.

298
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,551
So, I will not play any tricks.
We compete fairly.

299
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:26,431
You have never changed.

300
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:27,870
You're always honest

301
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:28,830
and straightforward.

302
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,590
When we competed as kids,

303
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,120
you put me ahead of three moves

304
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,311
because you're older.

305
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:38,630
This time I'll put you ahead.

306
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,791
Here, Zishan.

307
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:53,911
Here.

308
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,791
You look like...

309
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,670
It's safe.

310
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,630
Where's my brother?

311
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:13,870
He's gone back.

312
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:17,311
He has lots of work to do,
so he will not join us.

313
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,551
He asked me to take good care of you.

314
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:19,430
He's gone back?

315
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,511
How come I didn't see him?

316
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:22,711
Perhaps you took different paths
along the way.

317
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,190
Let's go. It's getting late.

318
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,870
Let's hit the road early
and find the person.

319
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:27,951
Okay.

320
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,190
Who tied me up?

321
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:48,471
Prince Yi?

322
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,311
No, that's not right.

323
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,110
Xu Chengfeng!

324
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,951
I opened my heart to you,
but you deceived me.

325
00:17:58,031 --> 00:17:59,910
Mr. Shen, you are awake.

326
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,630
Where's Xu Chengfeng? Get him here.

327
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,190
The General has already left the city.

328
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,350
He asked me to tell you something.

329
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,271
Zishan, I assume that when you wake up,
Danqing and I will have already left.

330
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:12,350
No worries.

331
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,271
I will protect Danqing
throughout the journey.

332
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,630
Please do not shout or struggle in vain.

333
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,271
Tomorrow morning, Tianhao will
send you back to your residence.

334
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,031
Zishan, your tolerance is high.

335
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:25,551
If I hadn't drugged you,

336
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:27,551
I couldn't have got you drunk.

337
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:29,951
Xu Chengfeng, you despicable wretch!

338
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:32,031
Mr. Shen, just give up.

339
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,430
The General has instructed
that before dawn,

340
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,031
I can't open the door and release you.

341
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,031
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

342
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,150
General Xu is to blame.

343
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,991
He says you live with Danqing,
so you have an edge.

344
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,711
It's never been a fair competition.

345
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,390
Considering that, you can't blame him.

346
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,311
Well, that's too bad.

347
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:51,190
That's nonsense.

348
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,390
Xu Chengfeng, I'll get to you later.

349
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,190
(Linguan Tavern)

350
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,670
I'm sorry, guests.

351
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,830
The guest rooms are almost full.

352
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,791
There's only one empty room.

353
00:18:57,951 --> 00:18:59,190
Only one room?

354
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:01,630
There are no other taverns nearby.

355
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,751
You have to make do with it for now.

356
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:06,791
The two of you are friends.
Is it okay to share one room?

357
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,511
We're not at home.

358
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:10,751
Mr. Shen, just make do for now.

359
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:35,791
Are you always so cautious?

360
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,150
I'm used to it when leading troops.

361
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,350
Besides, what if someone discovers
you are a woman in disguise,

362
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,430
covets your beauty,
and attacks you tonight?

363
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,951
Stop trying to scare me.
With your ability,

364
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:52,471
ordinary bandits are no match
for you at all.

365
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,150
You have that much confidence in me?

366
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,390
Tonight, you sleep on the bed.

367
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,430
I'll stand guard.

368
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,910
You can sleep without worry.

369
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,150
Although you don't look serious,

370
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,390
you are indeed reliable.

371
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,791
I care about you,
so I always think about your feelings.

372
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,511
Is the ground cold?

373
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,311
I'm used to it.

374
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,031
I grew up in barracks.

375
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:17,511
It's common to sleep outside.

376
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,150
Since you're little?

377
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:22,910
Ever since I can remember,

378
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,590
my father has taken me
to go out to battle.

379
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,551
When I turned 17,
my father died in battle.

380
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,590
Since then, I've been a general,

381
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,551
fighting my way up to this point.

382
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,830
What a young general.

383
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:39,830
It must be hard to be a general.

384
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,350
It's okay.

385
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,670
After becoming a general,
I knew a harsh truth.

386
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,311
General's success comes with the deaths
of tens of thousands of soldiers.

387
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:55,991
Among those soldiers,

388
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:59,190
some are in the prime

389
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,311
of their youth;

390
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,511
some love their country

391
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,071
and have faith in the world.

392
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,870
But actually, many join the army
because of struggling life.

393
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,910
Life is short.

394
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,271
I fight on the battlefield

395
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:16,190
and repel enemies

396
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:20,071
for world peace and people's happiness.

397
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,031
Perhaps this is my mission.

398
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,670
It is because of heroes like you

399
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,471
that people can live
in peace and contentment

400
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:35,511
without worries.

401
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,751
Alright, go to sleep.

402
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:43,150
Besides a peaceful world,

403
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,071
what I most want to see right now

404
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,551
is you sleeping soundly.

405
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,910
It's not my idea.

406
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,110
General Xu is to blame.

407
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,991
It has nothing to do with me

408
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,471
not at all.

409
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,751
Young Master, the carriage is ready
to take you back.

410
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,991
General.

411
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,910
Don't make me do things
that offend others.

412
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,791
You have a natural beauty.

413
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:51,150
Even the plainest clothes
look good on you.

414
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,311
Thank you. I'm flattered.

415
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,110
As an official, he was entangled
with a female prisoner.

416
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,751
In the end, he even lost his life.

417
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:05,630
What a pity.

418
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,751
That's too bad.

419
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:10,791
(Notice)

420
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,670
(Will he end up like this guy
if he's with me?)

421
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,670
Danqing.

422
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:26,231
Danqing.

423
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,511
Why do you look so upset
reading the notice?

424
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:35,511
Or have you ever committed a crime?

425
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,511
Why are you angry?

426
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:42,951
I was just joking.

427
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,670
I'm sorry.

428
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,271
Did I say something wrong?

429
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,430
General Xu, we're here
to investigate the developing water.

430
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,791
No time for joking.

431
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:00,870
Danqing.

432
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:03,670
Danqing.

433
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,951
General Xu, I've already told you.

434
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,910
Some men are following us.

435
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,471
They might be Prince Yi's men.

436
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:11,231
They're looking for
the developing water too.

437
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,031
We have to get rid of them.

438
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:16,551
We can't let them
find out Mr. Ouyang's address.

439
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,150
That makes sense.

440
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:39,751
Where are they?

441
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:40,511
Where?

442
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:55,830
Young Master, you didn't go out?

443
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,190
Let it go.

444
00:25:57,711 --> 00:26:00,390
You find a buyer for the jade

445
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:01,670
and give him some banknotes.

446
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,511
You let him buy all of Hetian jades
from Du Ying'er.

447
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,471
You warn that buyer

448
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,991
not to let Du Ying'er know
it's our arrangement.

449
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,311
Yes, I'll get right on it.

450
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:12,071
Go ahead.

451
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:20,311
Xu Chengfeng.

452
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,590
Mr. Ouyang.

453
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:34,511
Mr. Ouyang.

454
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:37,551
He's not home.

455
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,150
Let's go in.

456
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:40,711
Okay.

457
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:48,991
I have to say,

458
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,870
the decor
of this courtyard is fresh and elegant.

459
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,751
I guess Mr. Ouyang is a wise person
of great virtue and prestige.

460
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,791
Mr. Ouyang behaves like a naughty child.

461
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,071
He loves playful and weird stuff.

462
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:03,551
He dislikes playing by the rules.

463
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,991
Did Luo Ailian tell you

464
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,630
about Mr. Ouyang's preferences?

465
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,711
Otherwise, how did I know?

466
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:15,951
Who are you, kids?

467
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:17,910
Mr. Ouyang.

468
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:23,751
Are you sure this is Mr. Ouyang?

469
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,830
What are you here for?

470
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:32,951
Mr. Ouyang, don't you remember me?

471
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,350
I am a friend of Luo Ailian.

472
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:39,870
Who is Luo Ailian?

473
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:45,311
She is the eldest daughter of Luo Jida.

474
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,031
Oh, Luo.

475
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:50,830
I haven't met Luo for half a year.

476
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,830
Where is he?

477
00:27:56,271 --> 00:27:57,751
I see.

478
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,110
I still have an unfinished game
of chess with him.

479
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,670
Ailian, don't be sad.

480
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,870
I'm not Luo Ailian.

481
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,751
How are you not?

482
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,511
If you are not, then who are you?

483
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,311
Didn't I just tell you?

484
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:18,430
I am Shen Danqing.

485
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,110
I came to see you before
with Luo Ailian.

486
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,311
I'm old

487
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:26,951
with a bad memory.

488
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,910
What are you here to see me for?

489
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,590
Mr. Ouyang, have you ever heard
of the developing water?

490
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,630
No, I haven't.

491
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:49,751
I have stream water and spring water

492
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:51,350
for brewing and making tea.

493
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:56,870
And saliva, nasal mucus, and tears.

494
00:28:57,311 --> 00:29:01,110
But I have no developing water.

495
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,471
Why don't you think it over again?

496
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,471
I've already told you.
I know nothing of it.

497
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:07,031
If there is nothing else,

498
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:09,271
I have important things to do.

499
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:10,630
I have no time to accompany you.

500
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,791
Mr. Ouyang, please don't leave.

501
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:16,190
If we can help you
with your important matters,

502
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,031
could you then provide us with clues
about the developing water?

503
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,711
What important matters?

504
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,951
You're in white.

505
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:24,311
Just as we entered the door,

506
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,751
I noticed the wet mud on your clothes.

507
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,991
Although there has been rainfall lately,

508
00:29:29,471 --> 00:29:31,870
there is neither silt
nor standing water in the village,

509
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,670
I bet you climbed the mountain
early this morning.

510
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,670
You are in your sixties.

511
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:39,350
You must have gone up the mountain
to deal with something urgent.

512
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:42,551
When we arrived, you looked unwell.

513
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:45,271
It means
you haven't gotten your things done yet.

514
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,430
Alright, if you can guess
right away what I need to do,

515
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,590
I'll tell you what I know.

516
00:29:52,951 --> 00:29:53,471
Well...

517
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,791
I thought you were smart.

518
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:03,231
Get out of here.

519
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:04,150
Don't waste my time.

520
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,630
- Leave here.
- Mr. Ouyang.

521
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,311
Don't waste my time.

522
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:07,991
Get out of here.

523
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:12,350
- Mr. Ouyang.
- Leave here.

524
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:13,271
Mr. Ouyang.

525
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:14,711
Mr. Ouyang.

526
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:18,231
We think of another solution.

527
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,390
You just said
Mr. Ouyang went up the mountain.

528
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,271
Did he go to pick fruits?

529
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,271
This village is famous for its fruits.

530
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:29,830
Look around. It's all fruit trees.

531
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,150
But just now, we did not see any fruits
in the courtyard.

532
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,670
I just saw a cellar in his courtyard.

533
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,271
Perhaps the fruits are kept there.

534
00:30:38,031 --> 00:30:38,590
Cellar?

535
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,711
Why is he
in such a hurry to pick fruits?

536
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,511
I just smelled the fragrance
of wine on him.

537
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,231
But there was no smell of alcohol
on his breath.

538
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:49,150
I guess he is brewing wine himself.

539
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:51,791
And these fruits are the ingredients
for the wine.

540
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,311
That makes sense.

541
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:54,830
The minister mentioned in his letter

542
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,311
that Mr. Ouyang is a drinker.

543
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,350
Follow me.

544
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,071
Okay.

545
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,630
The fragrance of wine.

546
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,910
You are quite right.

547
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:07,471
He is brewing Moonlit Encounter.

548
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:09,551
The taste is only half similar.

549
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:11,031
Half?

550
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:14,551
Who let you in?

551
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,110
Mr. Ouyang.

552
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,711
Don't spoil my wine.

553
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:22,870
You have a wrong way
of brewing Moonlit Encounter.

554
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,430
Even if you add fruits into it,

555
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,271
the taste is not right.

556
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:26,231
It will only taste worse.

557
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,190
On what basis
do you reach this conclusion?

558
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,231
I can brew Moonlit Encounter.

559
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:34,031
Stop bragging.

560
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:35,511
As everyone knows,

561
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:39,670
Moonlit Encounter is made
by Miss Ailian's secret recipe.

562
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,471
It cannot possibly be divulged.

563
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,031
How can you brew it then?

564
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:45,110
The Luo family brews wine, and so do I.

565
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,791
Moonlit Encounter is difficult to make,

566
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:49,430
but with careful study,
it isn't hard for me.

567
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,630
Besides, aren't you also studying it?

568
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,951
Danqing, can you really brew it?

569
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:58,471
Since I can develop Chengfeng Wine
and Rose Liquor,

570
00:32:58,471 --> 00:33:01,190
I also can brew Moonlit Encounter.

571
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,231
You're overconfident.

572
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,110
Then we make a deal.

573
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:07,951
If I can brew Moonlit Encounter,

574
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:09,830
you will tell us
about the developing water.

575
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,791
That will depend on
whether you can actually brew it.

576
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,791
Deal. High five.

577
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:21,670
Good, get started.

578
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:25,791
I don't really know wine brewing,

579
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,231
but I know how to play chess.

580
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:31,110
I will play the unfinished chess game
with you.

581
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,311
You just leave the rest to her.

582
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:36,031
Let Danqing quickly brew the wine.

583
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:36,791
Alright.

584
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,031
Come, Mr. Ouyang.

585
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:38,751
Come on.

586
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:42,031
Be careful.

587
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,471
I won.

588
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,150
It was really a good game.

589
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:57,430
You're a better player than me.

590
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,231
You make me feel inadequate.

591
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:01,190
I am tired.

592
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,311
I'm going to take a nap.

593
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:03,430
I won't play with you anymore.

594
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:44,911
(Why can you do the same thing)

595
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:46,871
(as Luo Ailian?)

596
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:52,071
I'm feeling a bit unwell and go back.

why are you here?

602
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,951
Where is Mr. Ouyang?

603
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,150
He's resting.

This wine smells like Moonlit Encounter.

00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:49,511
Danqing, why can you brew the wine
that Luo Ailian can also make?

607
00:35:56,351 --> 00:35:58,710
Kid, where are you?

608
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:00,471
Let's have another game.

609
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,831
Mr. Ouyang is looking for you.

610
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:02,351
Go ahead.

611
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:07,270
Okay.

612
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,551
Smells so good.

613
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,351
Please have a try.

614
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,630
This is Moonlit Encounter?

615
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,031
How does it taste?

616
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,310
Let me try it again.

617
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,230
The best Moonlit Encounter

618
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,190
can't be made in a short time.

619
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,471
So I could only start
with the wine you made

620
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:15,790
and create this.

621
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,951
I think it should taste about the same.

622
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:19,750
This is the taste.

623
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,670
Tell me how to make this wine.

624
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,551
The recipe for this wine actually
comes from Li Bai's poem Qingpingdiao.

625
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,710
Let me explain it to you in detail.

626
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:35,230
Qingpingdiao?

627
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,840
(Admiring High Mountains)

628
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:45,670
Be careful.

629
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,871
Put them in Zishan's study.

630
00:37:48,551 --> 00:37:49,190
Okay.

631
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:52,230
Ying'er, what are you doing?

632
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,991
Zishan.

633
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,551
Have you sold out your jades?

634
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,471
Yes, I make a huge profit.

635
00:37:58,471 --> 00:37:59,431
That's great.

636
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:00,590
You will go back home soon.

637
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,710
If you tell your uncle about this,

638
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,071
he will surely be very happy.

639
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,511
No rush.

640
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:09,911
You bought all these things?

641
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:10,750
Yes.

642
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,471
I can't enjoy good things alone.

643
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,150
When I make money,
everyone gets a share.

644
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,551
And I have bothered you
and Danqing for a while.

645
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,911
So I got these gifts for everyone,

646
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,391
including Shuixian, Tianhao,

647
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,351
Mr. Qin, Mr. Luo, Mr. Miao,

648
00:38:25,351 --> 00:38:28,110
General Xu, and Xue'er.

649
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,431
They're the unexpected surprise
of my trip to Liao City.

650
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,831
Do you still have Mr. Du in your mind?

651
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,471
How could I forget father?

652
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:36,590
I've bought him a gift.

653
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,590
I've acquired an authentic painting
by Wu Daozi.

654
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:42,071
In that case, why not hurry home

655
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,511
and make your father happy?

656
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,630
I want to make Danqing happy first.

657
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,750
I bought her lots of clothes
and jewelry.

658
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,031
By the way, when is Danqing coming back?

659
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,511
Danqing? She hasn't sent a message yet.

660
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,911
She could not come back soon.

661
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,071
If you can't wait, you actually can...

662
00:38:59,071 --> 00:38:59,790
I can wait.

663
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,911
Wait, Zishan.

664
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:04,831
Do you dislike me?

665
00:39:05,391 --> 00:39:08,230
Why do I feel like
you're rushing me to leave?

666
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,431
How could that be?

667
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,551
Danqing and I get along well with you.

668
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,351
As you girl,
you've left your home for too long.

669
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,351
I'm afraid
that Mr. Du is worried about you.

670
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,270
Miss, I bought the flowers you wanted.

671
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,391
Smells good.

672
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:25,150
I saw them in Danqing's room.

673
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:27,911
I want to surprise her when she returns.

674
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:30,150
I will place these flowers everywhere.

675
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,270
Okay.

676
00:39:31,951 --> 00:39:32,991
I'll do it right now.

677
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:34,110
Miss.

678
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,951
Careful.

679
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,190
Where should I put it?

680
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:04,911
This spot is good.

Isn't he the father
of that wicked woman, Luo Ailian?

684
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:25,511

keeping her father's memorial tablet?

685
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:31,351
