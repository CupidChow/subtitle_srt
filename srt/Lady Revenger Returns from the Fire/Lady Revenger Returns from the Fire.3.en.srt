00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:18,880
=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,852
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:26,236
(Luo Residence)

4
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:27,909
Help me up.

5
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,189
I can't feel my legs.

6
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:33,628
Get Luo Xue'er here.

7
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:34,909
- Let her keep vigil.
- Yes.

8
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:37,508
Madam.

9
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:38,189
Shuangshuang.

10
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:40,228
At this moment,

11
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:41,949
you must restrain yourself.

12
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:44,348
Mother, you finally have the say
at home.

13
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:46,428
Why still act so subserviently?

14
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:48,389
It's not over yet.

15
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,309
We must be cautious.

16
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:50,628
The things we've done

17
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:52,189
may not be completely flawless.

18
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:54,749
Bad news.

19
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:55,949
Something has happened.

20
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:58,348
Luo Ailian's maid Bin is missing.

21
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,669
What?

22
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:01,669
The butler just came and told me.

23
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,268
Since the ancestral hall caught fire,

24
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:04,788
no one has seen her.

25
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:07,549
How come we forgot about her?

26
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,228
Where could she have gone to?

27
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:11,469
Mother.

28
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,469
Could she discover something

29
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,388
and run away?

30
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:15,828
Don't panic.

31
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:20,508
The ancestral hall is secluded,
and few people go there.

32
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:23,189
But now Bin is missing.

33
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:25,429
It makes me feel restless.

34
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:28,429
General Xu has arrived.

35
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:33,108
General Xu is here.

36
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,108
General, what brings you here?

37
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:37,508
Luo Ailian's death is suspicious.

38
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:39,909
I'm here today to ask you

39
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,749
some questions.

40
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:42,149
General.

41
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,068
What's suspicious
about my sister's death?

42
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,869
That day, with my permission,

43
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:50,068
Luo Ailian went home
and investigated Luo Jida's death.

44
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:52,348
I gave her a flare.

45
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:54,788
This flare can ignite
upon exposure to fire.

46
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,348
Even if she were trapped in a great fire
and couldn't escape,

47
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,909
the flare would still be ignited.

48
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:01,989
But that day,

49
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:03,989
there were no flares ignited at all.

50
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:05,948
It means that someone destroyed it.

51
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:07,989
So I surmise

52
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,589
she must have had an argument
with someone.

53
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:12,309
And it's very likely

54
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:15,548
that the perpetrator
deliberately set the fire

55
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:16,948
to obliterate all evidence.

56
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,589
Luo Ailian has a maid named Bin.

57
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,269
Perhaps she knows something.

58
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:26,269
Madam, please summon Bin.

59
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:29,909
To be honest,

60
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:31,869
we are also looking for Bin.

61
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,668
We just found out

62
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:34,828
that she went missing.

63
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:35,828
Missing?

64
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,228
Perhaps, as you said,

65
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:40,429
she knew something and fled away.

66
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:41,269
Or perhaps,

67
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,149
she is indeed the arsonist.

68
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:45,869
Bin is utterly loyal.

69
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:47,189
How could she harm my sister?

70
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,668
Cats hide their claws.

71
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:51,228
I'm just speculating

72
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:53,189
and trying to provide you
with some clues.

73
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:55,668
My family will do our utmost
to find her.

74
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:57,309
If there is any clue about the people

75
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:58,909
who entered and left the ancestral hall,

76
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:00,388
even the tiniest details,

77
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:02,189
you can come to my place and tell me.

78
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:02,909
Okay.

79
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:03,788
Okay.

80
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:04,989
General, please.

81
00:04:55,748 --> 00:04:56,308
Miss Xue'er.

82
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,428
Greetings, General Xu.

83
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:01,868
General thinks you may have something

84
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,029
to say to him in private.

85
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:05,509
So he's waiting here for you.

86
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:07,428
If you know anything,

87
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:08,829
feel free to tell me.

88
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,829
I can hold justice for you
and your sister.

89
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,829
Thank you.

90
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,748
But I have nothing to tell you.

91
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:23,509
Are you serious?

92
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:26,029
Sure.

93
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:28,348
Alright.

94
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:30,788
If you think of anything later,

95
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:32,748
you can always come
to my place to tell me.

96
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:33,909
I am leaving now.

97
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:50,149
I followed you in advance.

98
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:51,589
I'm warning you.

99
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:54,188
No matter what you see or know,

100
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,269
keep it to yourself.

101
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:57,509
Otherwise,

102
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:00,788
there will be no place
for you in this house.

103
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,108
Enjoy your meal.

104
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:34,597
Please.

105
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:35,788
Who are you?

106
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:37,108
I have booked here.

107
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:38,829
He's General Xu Chengfeng.

108
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,149
Pay your respects.

109
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:43,748
(Prefect Bai of Liao City)
Greetings, General Xu.

110
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:45,149
Greetings, General Xu.

111
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:46,069
Prefect Bai.

112
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:46,868
No need for that.

113
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,108
You know how to enjoy life.

114
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:54,868
You booked the whole restaurant

115
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:55,949
to have a meal.

116
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:57,469
I...

117
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,228
I booked this place

118
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:00,949
to welcome you.

119
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:02,868
Right.

120
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:04,308
That's all?

121
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:06,668
This atmosphere is not good enough.

122
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,469
If you find it too quiet,

123
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:13,069
I can ask the ladies of Chunxiang Tower

124
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:14,509
to dance and sing for you.

125
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,868
I'll make perfect arrangements.

126
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,149
That's very kind of you, Prefect Bai.

127
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:21,709
Come on.

128
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:23,589
Actually, don't be nervous.

129
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,389
I am easygoing.

130
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:27,668
Come on.

131
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:28,469
Here's to you.

132
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,108
Thank you.

133
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,108
When I stayed in Liao City,

134
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:38,788
I heard the Luo family of Ganlu Brewery
and the Du family

135
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:41,269
had an unmanageable dispute
over an accident.

136
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:44,188
Someone died
in a fire at the Luo Residence.

137
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,709
What exactly happened?

138
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:48,389
You tell General Xu
about the Luo family.

139
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:50,748
General.

140
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,788
Luo Ailian killed her father
and then set fire to herself.

141
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,269
The investigation is almost done.

142
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:56,748
We're working on the rest.

143
00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:59,149
We'll sort out case files
and close the case soon.

144
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:02,509
Prefect Bai resolves cases swiftly

145
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,069
with incredible discernment.

146
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,269
I'm flattered.

147
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:05,988
Yeah.

148
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,269
Speaking of closing the case,
you explain to me

149
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,069
about the bruises on Du Ruoshan's body.

150
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:14,029
Why did Luo Ailian kill her father?

151
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:16,308
And who set fire to the Luo Residence?

152
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:18,788
Are you going to let me
investigate it for you?

153
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:19,909
No.

154
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:20,909
Luo Ailian

155
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:22,788
has a maid named Bin.

156
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,269
She disappeared after the fire.

157
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:26,029
Send people to find her.

158
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:27,228
Yes.

159
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:28,668
Tianhao.

160
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:32,788
Guys, come on in.

161
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,468
Guys, eat and drink
to your heart's content.

162
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,788
Prefect Bai

163
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:39,869
will pay for the bill.

164
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:42,269
- Thank you, Prefect Bai.
- Thank you, Prefect Bai.

165
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:42,989
Well...

166
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,068
Prefect Bai.

167
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:47,668
I have something else to do.
I have to go.

168
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:48,788
Remember.

169
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:49,948
Take good care of them.

170
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:51,629
Yes.

171
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:57,029
Prefect Bai.

172
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:57,668
Well,

173
00:08:58,428 --> 00:08:59,869
General Xu's tricks

174
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:01,389
are unpredictable.

175
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,308
(According to the family motto,)

176
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:14,548
(men and women learn martial arts.)

177
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:16,269
(You can also wield a sword.)

178
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,149
(Our family's sword techniques
are flexible.)

179
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:21,288
(You can attack the enemy off guard.)

180
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:34,029
(Never give up.)

181
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,948
(This is the hardest part for me.)

182
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:39,869
(I must master it as soon as possible)

183
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:42,308
(to become the true Shen Danqing.)

184
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:45,948
(I cannot let bad people get their way.)

185
00:09:49,229 --> 00:09:50,909
You've been looking for Bin for so long.

186
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:52,509
There is no news about her?

187
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:54,428
Madam.

188
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:55,468
We failed

189
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,029
to find her.

190
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:57,708
You're so useless.

191
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,989
You can't do such a little thing.
You want a punishment?

192
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:01,588
I really can't find her.

193
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:03,109
I guess

194
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:06,149
Bin might already be dead.

195
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,269
Find her regardless of her
being dead or alive.

196
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:09,989
Keep looking.

197
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:11,068
Yes.

198
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,509
Where on earth has she hidden herself?

199
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:23,869
If the officials find her first,

200
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:25,068
we will be in trouble.

201
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:29,229
We spend more money

202
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,349
to hire more people to look for her.

203
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,989
Okay.

204
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:34,629
(General's Mansion)
General.

205
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:35,708
The coroner re-examined the body.

206
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,749
Apart from the fact
the body is two inches shorter

207
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:38,629
than that of Luo Ailian,

208
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:39,869
there are no other doubts.

209
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:41,509
The body is two inches shorter?

210
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:46,068
It's fishy.

211
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,828
I don't think it's a coincidence.

212
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:50,068
It's indeed suspicious.

213
00:10:50,468 --> 00:10:51,468
But the coroner said

214
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,068
Miss Ailian's body was badly damaged.

215
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:55,308
And after a long time,

216
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,708
it's normal to happen to her body.

217
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:58,389
No new evidence emerges in this case.

218
00:10:58,828 --> 00:10:59,909
There's nothing we can do.

219
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,149
Prefect Bai
is waiting for your instructions.

220
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:03,588
General.

221
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,188
I know you're righteous.

222
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:06,948
But we have done our utmost

223
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,869
to resolve this case.

224
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,149
Tianhao.

225
00:11:14,428 --> 00:11:16,869
Have someone properly bury Luo Ailian.

226
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,509
And erect a tombstone for her.

227
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:19,269
Yes.

228
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:24,428
Miss.

229
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:26,869
This is the new moisturizing cream
I formulated.

230
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:30,229
Apply it daily
to the black lotus tattoo.

231
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:32,349
The scar will soon heal.

232
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:33,629
Thank you.

233
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:50,269
She's the person we're looking for.

234
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:53,109
Danqing.

235
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:00,668
Don't move.

236
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:01,909
Let's go.

237
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,029
Are you sure she has burns on her body?

238
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:06,828
Yes.

239
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:07,909
Take her away.

240
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:08,668
How dare you!

241
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,749
I'm Shen Danqing
of the Shen Escort Agency.

242
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,509
How dare you seize me at my place?

243
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,668
Who exactly is behind this?

244
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,468
If you were really Miss Shen,

245
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,149
would they bear to let you get burned?

246
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:20,349
You covered your scars with tattoos.

247
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:22,788
You must be Miss Luo hiding here.

248
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:26,472
I don't know what you're talking about.

249
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:28,468
I am Shen Danqing.

250
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:29,588
Do you take us

251
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:30,828
for fools?

252
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:31,828
Brother.

253
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:32,389
Speak.

254
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:33,188
Who are you exactly?

255
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:37,149
I...

256
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:41,468
I am Shen Danqing.

257
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:42,948
Brother.

258
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:43,588
Speak!

259
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:44,668
Who is she?

260
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,468
She's my younger sister,

261
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:48,389
Shen Danqing.

262
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:53,948
I am Luo Ailian.

263
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:59,468
Let him go.

264
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:01,349
I will go with you.

265
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:02,509
Take her away.

266
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,032
- Sorry, Young Master.
- Sorry, Young Master.

267
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:19,308
You may leave.

268
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:21,308
- Yes.
- Yes.

269
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:25,509
This is all fake?

270
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:27,909
You lied to me.

271
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:29,708
You said you would never make a mistake.

272
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:31,948
But you just exposed yourself.

273
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:34,948
Do you know what disaster

274
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:35,948
it will bring to my family?

275
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:37,749
I thought they were going to kill you.

276
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:39,229
Even if I die before you today,

277
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,788
you are Shen Danqing, not Luo Ailian.

278
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:46,909
Why?

279
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,308
Why did you deceive me?

280
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:51,509
On the surface,

281
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,149
you became Shen Danqing.

282
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:54,909
But deep down,
you have not changed at all.

283
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,109
You were deceived
and used by others before.

284
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,749
It's because you were
soft-hearted and gullible.

285
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:01,948
You've already died once.

286
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:03,548
Can't you learn a lesson?

287
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:06,548
If your sister were still alive,

288
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:08,948
she would be sure to save you

289
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,308
if you were in danger.

290
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:17,668
Give up the thought of taking revenge.

291
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:19,749
Once you make a mistake,

292
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,428
it will cost your life

293
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:23,909
and implicate the Shen family.

♪A lifetime of disaster exchanged
for one night of getting drunk♪

295

She traded her life for yours.

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:40,068
She was worried about you.

297
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:42,188
She is kind-hearted,

298
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,269
so she was easily deceived and used.

299
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:49,548
You looked harsh and severe,

300
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,188
and stopped her from taking revenge
in case of implicating your family.

301
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:56,308
In fact, you're trying
to toughen her will.

302
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:00,749
Her fate is connected
with that of the Shen family.

303
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:02,948
She must endure this trial.

304
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:05,828
If she can refrain herself,

305
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:09,668

I get it.

312

Shen Zishan just warned me

313
00:15:44,188 --> 00:15:45,948
that I chose a bumpy road.

314
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:49,068
But no matter what,

315
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,349
I will not give up.

I can't sleep after waking up.

Everything about Luo Ailian

319
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:24,029
will vanish forever along with it.

320
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:04,988
I will make them pay

321

have been clearly recorded

Xuepian fabrics were sold out
on the eighth of the twelfth month.

346
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:26,829
We received three bolts
of this fabric half a year ago.

347
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:27,869
And they were sold out soon.

376
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:29,228
(You put me in a difficult situation.)

377
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,589
(I must uncover the truth)

378
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:33,668
(to prove my innocence.)

379
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:50,549
You mean

380
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,268
it was coated with agarwood powder,

381
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:53,988
so it turned yellow when it was lit.

382
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:56,748
Some varieties of flowers,

383
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,309
such as the agarwood gardenia,

384
00:20:58,589 --> 00:20:59,829
can be used as a fragrance,

385
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:02,188
and also for dyeing fabric.

386
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,909
They will change color quickly
once they are heated.

387
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:14,589
(The fabric was stained
with agarwood powder.)

388
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:16,668
(It means this person)

389
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,629
(was related to my father's death)

390
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:20,869
(and even appeared at the fire site.)

391
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,109
(Luo Shuangshuang.)

392
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:25,589
(Why are you so cruel?)

393
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:27,629
(You harmed father, set me on fire,)

394
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,909
(and tried to completely eradicate me.)

395
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:34,028
This is Danqing's sword.

396
00:21:34,988 --> 00:21:36,584
You've practiced swordsmanship
for a while.

397
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:38,309
If you can pass my test

398
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:39,789
and seize the sword,

399
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:42,069
you will truly become Shen Danqing.

♪Your indifference is not concealed♪

402

If you find it difficult,
you can give up at any time.

403
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:10,948
I will not give up.

404
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,309
Again.

00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:36,389
You just used Danqing's dart techniques.

408
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:38,349
It was a blunt dart,
and you didn't mean to hurt me.

409
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:42,869
Danqing's sword

410
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:44,829

Bin.

414
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,228
I did it.

00:22:56,748 --> 00:22:58,309
You have now truly become Shen Danqing.

417
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:00,789
It's my sister's hairpin

418
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:02,748
she cherished the most
when she was alive.

419
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:04,948
Please cherish it.

420
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,668
Miss, today is the Grain Rain.

421
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:16,629
Young Master ordered me
to bring you the Grain Rain tea.

422
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:30,988
Grain Rain?

423
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:34,109
After the Grain Rain each year,

424
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:35,948
the Luo family will send birthday liquor

425
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,109
to Mr. Li in the capital.

426
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,389
After I've changed my appearance,

427
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:45,149
it's my first time seeing him.

428
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:47,309
I need to give him a surprise.

429
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:49,028
How about I start

430
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,708
with the birthday liquor?

431
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:57,629
The other day,
my father could be up and about.

432
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,829
How come he can't even
take his medicine now?

433
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:02,109
Because he saw your sister reviving,

434
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,428
he became better.

435
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:05,589
But now he's caught a chill.

436
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,589
So his illness has worsened.

437
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:12,428
You know what to do, right?

438
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:15,549
He needs to eat fresh ginseng.

439
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:18,789
But it's not the right season now,

440
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:20,829
so it's very hard to find it.

441
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:23,309
I'll find a way
to get the fresh ginseng.

442
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,109
Are you okay? Why the rush?

443
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:32,909
I'm here to see father.

444
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:36,708
Okay. Go ahead.

445
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:52,748
(It's time to meet you)

446
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:54,188
(with this new identity.)

447
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:57,948
You all must have heard

448
00:24:58,228 --> 00:25:00,109
that the Luo family needs armed escorts

449
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:01,549
to deliver distiller's yeast.

450
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:03,499
(The Luo family is in urgent need of armed escorts to deliver birthday liquor)
As it gets warmer, it's not easy to preserve the distiller's yeast.

451
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:04,028
(armed escorts to deliver birthday liquor)
to preserve the distiller's yeast.

452
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:06,149
So they can't find armed escorts.

453
00:25:06,748 --> 00:25:07,468
Everyone.

454
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:10,428
Who wants to join me
in taking on this escort mission?

455
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:12,069
When do we leave?

456
00:25:13,508 --> 00:25:14,268
Immediately.

457
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:17,748
(Head to the Luo Residence.)

458
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:23,468
Alright, Miss.

459
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:25,149
Miss.

460
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,708
We have an appointment
with the Luo family

461
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,948
to discuss cooperation at noon.

462
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,069
Two hours have already passed.

463
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:31,028
Shouldn't we go now?

464
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:33,149
You go to the Luo Residence first.

465
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:35,188
Remember, no matter how they ask,

466
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:36,468
just say I'll be there shortly.

467
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:38,109
Yes.

468
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:42,069
(No rush.)

469
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:45,188
(Let me play this game with you.)

470
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:47,988
Madam and the young lady will meet
with the guests.

471
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:50,708
They specifically told us
to take care of the ancestral hall.

472
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:52,629
Miss Xue'er, you're walking so slowly.

473
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:54,309
You will get me into trouble.

474
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:55,589
I'm not feeling very well.

475
00:25:56,069 --> 00:25:56,948
I'm a bit...

476
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:04,988
Be careful.

477
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,389
Are you okay?

478
00:26:08,748 --> 00:26:09,549
Thank you, Miss.

479
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:12,268
Perhaps I've moved too many things,

480
00:26:12,268 --> 00:26:13,389
so my shoulder is a bit strained.

481
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:15,109
It's not serious.

482
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:18,428
Thank you, Miss.

483
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:21,228
Why are you so slow?

484
00:26:21,228 --> 00:26:22,228
Madam is waiting anxiously.

485
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:28,748
(Xue'er, I cannot acknowledge you
for the time being.)

486
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:30,629
(Take good care of yourself.)

487
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:35,629
(Luo Residence)
Mr. Lin.

488
00:26:35,948 --> 00:26:38,468
We have been waiting for almost an hour.

489
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,829
When will Miss Shen arrive?

490
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,228
She will be here soon.

491
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:45,629
Please be patient, Mr. Luo.

492
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:46,869
Be here soon?

493
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:48,228
It's been almost an hour.

494
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:51,349
Even though the Shen family once served
as the imperial Escort Agency,

495
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,428
they are still of a lower class.

496
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:56,109
Who do they think they are?

497
00:26:58,668 --> 00:26:59,748
You're so cocky.

498
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:11,309
Miss Shen, we've waited for a while.

499
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:21,909
This is my daughter, Shuangshuang.

500
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:25,708
Miss Shuangshuang.

501
00:27:25,988 --> 00:27:27,909
Could you repeat

502
00:27:28,268 --> 00:27:29,389
what you just said?

503
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:32,468
My daughter was rude just now.

504
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:35,109
I hope you won't take it to heart.

505
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:36,909
Miss Shen.

506
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:39,028
We are sincere about doing this deal.

507
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:41,549
The contract has been drafted.
Please review it.

508
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:48,428
There was no issue with the contract.

509
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:50,668
But with the warning
of Miss Shuangshuang,

510
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:52,909
I think the price should be increased

511
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,589
by 20 percent.

512
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:55,829
What are you talking about?

513
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:56,708
The ancestors of my family

514
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,952
were appointed by His Majesty
as the imperial Escort Agency.

515
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:00,389
If the price is too low, I'm afraid

516
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,188
it will reduce
Dafeng imperial family's recognition

517
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,028
of the Shen Escort Agency.

518
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,549
And some snobs will look down upon us.

519
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:08,349
What?

520
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:11,109
Miss Shen.

521
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:12,228
The price we offered

522
00:28:12,228 --> 00:28:14,309
is already much higher
than the market price.

523
00:28:14,748 --> 00:28:17,468
Are you trying to rip me off?

524
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:20,149
Mr. Luo, what makes you say that?

525
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:21,708
Your family is wealthy.

526
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,109
Do you care about a small amount
of money?

527
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:26,309
Or are you dissatisfied
with the imperial standards?

528
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:28,149
You're jacking up the price.

529
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:32,748
Forget it.

530
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:35,909
It seems we won't agree on the price.

531
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:38,309
That's alright. I will leave.

532
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:39,468
Well...

533
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,309
Miss Shen.

534
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:43,629
That's not what Shuangshuang meant.

535
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:45,909
We indeed need
to transport the goods urgently.

536
00:28:46,228 --> 00:28:46,869
How about we raise

537
00:28:47,988 --> 00:28:48,948
the price by ten percent?

538
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:49,708
By 20 percent.

539
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:54,629
But that's too much, Miss Shen.

540
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:56,549
I've never seen anyone
raise the price so much.

541
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:01,389
Enough.

542
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,748
If the yeast goes bad,
we will have to compensate.

543
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:06,069
This is so annoying.

544
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:09,389
Okay, 20 percent.

545
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,869
It's a deal.

546
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:15,789
Once the contract is signed,
there's no turning back.

547
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:17,428
Hopefully, we cooperate pleasantly.

548
00:29:18,468 --> 00:29:20,109
Mr. Lin, examine the goods.

549
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:20,789
Shuixian.

550
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,069
Take Mr. Lin to the warehouse.

551
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:24,268
Yes.

552
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:25,349
Mr. Lin, this way, please.

553
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:28,109
I have one more favor to ask.

554
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:31,829
I received Mr. Luo Jida's kindness
when I was younger.

555
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,069
Today, since I'm here,

556
