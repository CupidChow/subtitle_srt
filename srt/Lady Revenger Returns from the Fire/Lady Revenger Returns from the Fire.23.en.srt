=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,248
=Episode 23=

3
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:45,852
Zong Wei.

4
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:49,332
You wait.

5
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,651
I'll kill them to avenge you.

6
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,451
Your Highness, congratulations.

7
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:05,531
You've trodden Shen Danqing

8
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:07,052
and Xu Chengfeng underfoot.

9
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,492
They can never outfight you.

10
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:10,892
Get up.

11
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,531
Join me for a drink.

12
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:14,732
Thank you, Your Highness.

13
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:24,452
You're so wise.

14
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,811
You memorized the treasure map route
at a glance.

15
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:29,772
With the other half of the treasure map
in your hands,

16
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:32,131
you'll obtain the treasure very soon.

17
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,052
Very soon?

18
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,492
I feel good about today's revenge.

19
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:42,052
But the developing water
is losing its effect,

20
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,851
and the minister will be more cautious.

21
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,531
Without the developing water,

22
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:47,811
what can I do with half a map?

23
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,212
Your Highness,
Plum Wine is a type of liquor.

24
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:52,971
My family is well-known for making wine.

25
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:56,651
I'll seek advice
from Ganlu Brewery's skilled winemakers

26
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:58,052
to alleviate your concerns.

27
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:03,651
I almost forgot your ability.

28
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:07,172
I will await your good news.

29
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:08,411
Yes.

30
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:15,212
I couldn't have succeeded

31
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:16,651
without you today.

32
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:18,131
It was your idea.

33
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:19,612
Utilizing Luo Ailian's identity

34
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:21,612
to catch them off guard.

35
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:23,251
Here is

36
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:25,772
to you.

37
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:29,172
I'm flattered.

38
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:32,492
You're foresighted and thoughtful.

39
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:34,292
You confirmed Luo Ailian's identity

40
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:35,571
by her fingerprints.

41
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,571
Otherwise, my plan
might not have succeeded.

42
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,212
You don't take credit

43
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:41,732
and know when to stop.

44
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:43,932
You're useful to me.

45
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,052
It's my honor

46
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,371
to alleviate your concerns.

47
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,212
Someone else

48
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:00,971
once said the same thing to me.

49
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:03,932
His name was Zong Wei.

50
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:07,371
He was once my most capable subordinate.

51
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:10,732
But he was killed
by Xu Chengfeng and Shen Zishan.

52
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:17,972
Zong Wei held an irreplaceable place
in my heart.

53
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,571
But now he's gone.

54
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:32,532
I hope

55
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,172
that you can become another one

56
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,131
I admire

57
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:39,211
and trust the most.

58
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:41,292
I'm willing to serve you, Your Highness.

59
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:43,852
I will never let you down.

60
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,251
Since you understand me so well,

61
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:58,412
I'll reward you handsomely.

62
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,968
(Prince Yi's Mansion)

63
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:49,691
How is it going?

64
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:51,371
Failed.

65
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,571
Still unable to brew it?

66
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:02,811
Miss.

67
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:04,852
The Plum Wine has long been lost.

68
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:06,292
Without the recipe

69
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,211
or any finished wine to refer to,

70
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:09,891
I have to say

71
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,891
few people can brew it now.

72
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:14,652
(His Highness mentioned)

73
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:17,331
(that Shen Danqing found the Plum Wine.)

74
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:23,652
If Luo Ailian has tasted this wine,

75
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:24,972
could she brew it?

76
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:26,972
If she has tasted it,

77
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:29,331
and even if the brewing process
is complex,

78
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,891
I suppose there's a 90 percent chance
of restoring it.

79
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:34,292
Unfortunately...

80
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:41,972
(It seems this is the only way.)

81
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,331
Sister, we meet again.

82
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:03,811
I dare not be your sister.

83
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:06,331
Ailian, are you blaming me?

84
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:10,891
Your attitude is truly disgusting.

85
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,131
Do you think you're still the young lady

86
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,612
and General Xu's fiancee?

87
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:19,412
Now you are just a humble prisoner.

88
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:21,852
But I am different now.

89
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:24,412
I now belong to His Highness.

90
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:26,331
People follow my command,

91
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:27,732
and I enjoy all the glory and favor.

92
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,172
The last time you were imprisoned,

93
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,451
Xu Chengfeng came to your rescue.

94
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,331
Who do you expect to save you this time?

95
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,412
Xu Chengfeng and Shen Zishan,

96
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,652
one is a general
and the other a young hero.

97
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:41,732
Both will lose their lives
because of you.

98
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:44,371
Ailian, I'm afraid
you can't escape this time.

99
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:49,092
Why not let me save you?

100
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:50,771
After climbing the social ladder,

101
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,011
your tone has changed.

102
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,532
If I were you,
instead of wasting energy arguing,

103
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:57,092
I would think about how to survive.

104
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,492
I came today to show you the way.

105
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:06,092
Spit it out.

106
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:07,771
The developing water won't work.

107
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,652
As long as you can brew new Plum Wine,

108
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:12,371
you will redeem yourself
and walk out of here alive.

109
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,691
Perhaps even greater fortune awaits you.

110
00:08:20,652 --> 00:08:22,251
Prince Yi sent you here, didn't he?

111
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:24,612
He has the half of the treasure map.

112
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,492
Ailian, don't make false accusations.

113
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:30,571
His Highness is concerned
about state affairs

114
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:31,652
and helping His Majesty.

115
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,132
Since you're asking for my help,

116
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:35,811
don't talk so high and mighty.

117
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,292
I'm not asking for your help.

118
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,532
You are clever.

119
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,652
You know I offer you a good deal.

120
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:44,811
Indeed.

121
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:47,571
This is a good deal.

122
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,331
However,

123
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,851
you'll have to wait some time.

124
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,971
Good. Clever decision.

125
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,691
Tell me how many days you need.

126
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,412
Wait until I'm dead.

127
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,532
I'll wait for you and Prince Yi
in the underworld.

128
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:08,772
At that time,

129
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:12,012
we'll do this deal slowly.

130
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:15,611
You ungrateful fool.

131
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:17,412
Fine.

132
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:19,652
You just stay here and die

133
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:21,451
with your husband and brother.

134
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:38,971
(The developing water isn't working.)

135
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:41,012
(As long as you can brew new Plum Wine,)

136
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:43,491
(you will redeem yourself
and walk out of here alive.)

137
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,052
(Plum Wine?)

138
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,052
(I see.)

139
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:49,132
(Chengfeng.)

140
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:51,451
(You deliberately mentioned
the developing water is expiring)

141
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:53,971
(just to force Prince Yi
to find the developing water.)

142
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:55,331
(If so,)

143
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,652
(this might be a chance to survive.)

144
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:01,971
Somebody!

145
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:03,451
Is anybody there?

146
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:05,412
Stop yelling.

147
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,048
Let me see the minister.

148
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:08,532
Who do you think you are?

149
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:09,731
Behave.

150
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:17,331
That day,

151
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:19,772
in court, there were both witnesses
and physical evidence.

152
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,731
And Chengfeng confessed personally.

153
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,052
If we turn this situation around,

154
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:26,892
it's harder than we think.

155
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:27,532
Minister.

156
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:29,252
Please save the general.

157
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:31,144
You watched him grow up.

158
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,252
You know he wouldn't
steal the map and commit treason.

159
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:35,132
Yes.

160
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:38,532
I believe
Chengfeng isn't that kind of person.

161
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:40,012
You're wise.

162
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:42,731
Please uphold justice

163
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,451
and prove the general's innocence.

164
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:47,731
To turn this around,

165
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:49,532
we must find new evidence

166
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:52,892
to prove
that Prince Yi framed Chengfeng.

167
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:54,412
Or,

168
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:56,851
find the other half of the treasure map.

169
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:59,292
Only then could this situation
be reversed.

170
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:00,652
Do you understand?

171
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:02,252
Whatever it takes, I will

172
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,292
find the evidence
to overturn the conviction.

173
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:06,932
Then I will still rely on you
to advocate for the general.

174
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:09,932
Go quickly.

175
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:11,491
There isn't much time left.

176
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:13,652
You must find it
before the developing water

177
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:14,611
loses its effect.

178
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:15,731
Otherwise,

179
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:18,491
Chengfeng will die.

180
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:20,532
Understood.

181
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:27,292
Your Highness.

182
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:36,172
What about the developing water?

183
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:39,172
Plum Wine has been lost for a long time.

184
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:41,012
Minister has the last jar of it.

185
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:43,132
We have no recipe

186
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:44,772
or any finished wine to replicate it.

187
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:46,811
The most skilled winemaker

188
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:48,811
of Ganlu Brewery
doesn't know how to make it.

189
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:51,691
However, there is one person

190
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,292
who might be able to do it.

191
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:54,971
Just tell me.

192
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:57,412
Luo Ailian.

193
00:11:58,292 --> 00:11:59,772
She's Shen Danqing now.

194
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:01,691
Shen Danqing?

195
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:04,532
She is a brewing prodigy,

196
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:05,772
capable of guessing the mix

197
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:07,451
of any wine she's tasted.

198
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:09,731
If she wants to replicate it,

199
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:11,292
it will not be hard for her.

200
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:12,211
Exactly.

201
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:16,292
She's seen the only remaining Plum Wine

202
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:19,052
and studied it for several days
with the minister's consent.

203
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:21,091
That's great.

204
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,851
I have thought of this.

205
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:26,451
So I took the liberty
to persuade her in prison.

206
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,331
But she was unappreciative

207
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:29,772
and refused to cooperate.

208
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:30,932
It's okay.

209
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:32,851
I have my own methods.

210
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:36,772
But you.

211
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:38,652
Luo Ailian is your enemy.

212
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:41,012
If she works for me,

213
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,451
she will likely threaten you.

214
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:45,932
Yet you did not conceal it.

215
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,772
You wholeheartedly plan for me.

216
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:48,611
Well,

217
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:50,091
it's good.

218
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,292
My body and heart belong to you.

219
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,052
Naturally, I must think about you.

220
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:57,292
I knew it.

221
00:12:58,451 --> 00:12:59,652
The woman I value

222
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:01,932
never disappoints me.

223
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:24,731
You look so calm.

224
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:26,611
You're finally here.

225
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,611
It seems

226
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:30,292
you're waiting for me.

227
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:32,451
You arrived a few days later
than I expected.

228
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:35,691
It seems that finding the Plum Wine

229
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,132
took you a long time.

230
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:40,731
You intentionally said the lifespan
of the Plum Wine in court.

231
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:44,052
You must have thought of the next move.

232
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,412
Just tell me what you wanna say.

233
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:49,091
I never intended to leave alive.

234
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,412
The minister's developing water fails,

235
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:54,052
and I will die.

236
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,012
At the same time,
the treasure map in your hands

237
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:58,811
will become a worthless piece of paper.

238
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:00,971
Your so-called grand aspirations

239
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:02,532
will never be accomplished.

240
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,372
We both will lose.

241
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,331
Isn't that what you want?

242
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,652
It seems you still don't understand me.

243
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,731
That's not what I want.

244
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:17,611
I believe you should already know

245
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,091
that only Danqing can brew Plum Wine.

246
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:22,211
She still has value to you.

247
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:23,652
You must not let her die.

248
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:25,652
I can die,

249
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:27,932
but Danqing and Zishan cannot

250
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:29,172
be implicated by me.

251
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:33,731
If you can persuade Shen Danqing

252
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:35,292
to make the developing water for me,

253
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:37,691
I will spare her and Shen Zishan.

254
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:42,172
Now, you must choose

255
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:45,491
between the lesser of two evils.

256
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:48,012
If you can promise

257
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:49,811
that they will live safely,

258
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,172
I'll agree to your terms.

259
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:53,132
It's a deal.

260
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:55,532
However,

261
00:14:56,491 --> 00:14:57,172
I have

262
00:14:58,571 --> 00:14:59,691
one more term.

263
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:05,451
I know what you are thinking.

264
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:09,491
Before I die,

265
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,331
I'll confess and kill myself

266
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:13,052
with guilt

267
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:14,451
to close this case.

268
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:15,848
Then,

269
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:18,091
you will have no further concerns.

270
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:19,372
Good.

271
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:22,772
Indeed, you are the one
who understands my thoughts the best.

272
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:23,971
Over the years,

273
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,331
only when I have crossed swords with you

274
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,932
can I truly enjoy the thrill
of meeting my match.

275
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:31,892
I also

276
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:33,772
understand your thoughts.

277
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:36,412
If you were to die right now,

278
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:39,252
you probably would die with regret.

279
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:43,652
If it were before,

280
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,611
I would not have been content.

281
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:49,172
But now that I have met Danqing.

282
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:50,772
Whatever I do for her,

283
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:52,331
I feel it's worth it.

284
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:57,811
I didn't expect you
to be such a romantic.

285
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,412
Given that,

286
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:02,652
why do you let your death
separate you two?

287
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:04,491
I can help.

288
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:08,532
I can intercede with His Majesty

289
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:11,252
to spare your life.

290
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:12,652
How about that?

291
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:16,851
There's something you don't know.

292
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:18,851
The first rule of my family motto is

293
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,851
that whoever betrays the emperor

294
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:22,412
shall be expelled from home

295
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:24,851
and never be a descendant
of the Xu family.

296
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:26,451
We have battled for years.

297
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:27,811
Do you hate me so much

298
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:29,091
that make me expelled from home?

299
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,412
Life is like a chess game.

300
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:35,532
Those who know the game live;

301
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:36,851
those who break the game win.

302
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,772
And now, I'm the one
in control of the game.

303
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:41,731
The reason I spare your life is

304
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,451
that I admire you
for your honors in the field.

305
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,491
You're a rare military talent.

306
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:48,132
So I hold you in high esteem.

307
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:49,451
If you were someone else,

308
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,451
I wouldn't have said those words.

309
00:16:58,571 --> 00:16:59,372
I'm afraid

310
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:01,412
I have to refuse your kindness.

311
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:04,572
You're talented but stubborn.

312
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:06,332
Since you're unappreciative,

313
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:07,932
don't blame me

314
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:10,132
for killing you.

315
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:13,771
We have battled

316
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:16,132
for so many years.

317
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:19,531
You ultimately lost.

318
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:26,251
However,

319
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:28,612
I will arrange for you

320
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:32,211
to see Shen Danqing one last time.

321
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:01,812
Chengfeng.

322
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,172
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

323
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,211
I'm fine.

324
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,211
You confessed and claimed

325
00:18:10,211 --> 00:18:11,612
the developing water would soon fail.

326
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:12,932
It's part of your plan,

327
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:14,251
and we still have a slim chance, right?

328
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:16,332
Of course.

329
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,451
We can all live well.

330
00:18:21,172 --> 00:18:21,971
I begged the minister

331
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:23,691
to allow me to see you

332
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:25,332
just to reassure you.

333
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,531
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

334
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,092
If not for my identity,

335
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:36,812
we wouldn't have been framed
by Prince Yi.

336
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:39,176
Chengfeng.

337
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:41,092
Do you regret being

338
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:42,372
with me?

339
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:51,892
No matter who you are,

340
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:54,172
I have never regretted

341
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,812
meeting

342
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:59,172
or knowing you.

343
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:01,892
Me too.

344
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:03,612
Knowing you

345
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:06,372
is the luckiest thing in my life.

346
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:12,652
Danqing.

347
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:15,011
Trust me.

348
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:17,092
I promised to protect you.

349
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:19,211
I won't break my promise.

350
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:23,412
I believe in you.

351
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,251
I went to war

352
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:26,892
and never feared death.

353
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,092
Since I met you,

354
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:32,051
I realized that I've had an attachment.

355
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:34,172
I have someone I want to be with.

356
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,332
If we break the deadlock together,

357
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,932
things will work out fine,
and we'll have a bright future.

358
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:44,932
I still owe you a grand wedding.

359
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:49,451
Even without a grand wedding,

360
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:52,251
we can pledge our love under the sky
and vow upon the earth.

361
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:54,172
Xu Chengfeng,

362
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:55,771
I am willing

363
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,051
to be your wife and spend

364
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,572
our lives together.

365
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,011
Hearing that,

366
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm very content.

367
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:18,572
Danqing.

368
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:20,932
You can make the Plum Wine.

369
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,132
That's your leverage.

370
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,412
It's also the leverage
that keeps us alive.

371
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:27,496
Yes.

372
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:29,172
Remember.

373
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:31,251
Make good use of this leverage.

374
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:35,251
Okay.

375
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:44,491
General Xu, please.

376

Xu Chengfeng, you may die now.

394
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,051
It seems I misjudged you before.

395
00:22:56,932 --> 00:22:58,691
You're not heartless.

396
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:01,892
Even if you die a million times,

397
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:04,291
it cannot outweigh Zong Wei's life.

398
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:05,491

399
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,132
Why fear death?

400
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:09,491
If it can secure a safe life
for the one I love,

401
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:11,051
it will be worth it.

402
00:23:12,812 --> 00:23:14,372
I hope you will keep your promise

403
00:23:15,731 --> 00:23:17,491
and spare Danqing and Zishan.

404
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:18,771
To others,

405
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,932

407
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,412
I will keep my word.

408
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:28,852
As long as you die,

409
00:23:29,412 --> 00:23:31,691
I will certainly spare them.

410
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:33,451
Good.

411
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,211
You've done many bad things,

412
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:57,576
so you may not have the last laugh.

413
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:08,771

414
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:13,251
Does it feel terrible to be dying?

415
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:26,172

(but I still believe)

421
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:44,092

422
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:52,771

423
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,691

00:24:55,652 --> 00:24:56,412
(I don't know.)

425
00:24:57,451 --> 00:24:59,092
(But one day,)

426
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:00,812
(I found)

427
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:03,211
(I have eyes)

428
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:04,771

429
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:06,731
(but you.)

430
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,416

(and never part.)

434

(Danqing.)

435
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:32,491
(I'll never go back on my word to you.)

436
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:35,092
(I will protect you)

437
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,372
(at the cost of my life.)

438
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:31,336
(Liao City Yamen)

439
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:39,971
Unexpectedly,

440
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:42,731
a young general

441
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:46,612
ends up killing himself
to escape punishment.

442
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:49,531
You've just examined him.

443
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:52,011
Xu Chengfeng indeed committed suicide.

444
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,291
And his confession says

445
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:57,251
the other half of the treasure map

446
00:26:57,412 --> 00:27:00,051
was destroyed
before he found the developing water.

447
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,731
Therefore, only half remains.

448
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:06,612
In this case,
the treasure might be hard to find.

449
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:14,852
Things have come to this.

450
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:17,092
What are you going to do?

451
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:18,572
Early tomorrow morning,

452
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,852
I will take his confession back
to the capital.

453
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:25,652
This case has dragged on
for a long time.

454
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:28,612
I did not expect this coming.

455
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:33,372
Given Xu Chengfeng's past achievements,

456
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:36,372
I hope you can allow Tianhao

457
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:38,612
to take away his body

458
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,932
to bury him.

459
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:44,092
Alright.

460
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,971
What are you doing? Let go of me!

461
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,612
Are you surprised to see me?

462
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:54,491
I came to take you out of prison.

463
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:55,932
Come with me.

464
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:57,531
Why should I go with you?

465
00:27:58,332 --> 00:28:00,211
Xu Chengfeng killed himself
out of fear of his crimes.

466
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,332
The case of the treasure map
has been solved.

467
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:04,372
The minister has also returned
to the capital.

468
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:05,731
As for you,

469
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,731
before Xu Chengfeng died,

470
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:09,731
he entrusted you to me.

471
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:12,412
So you must come with me.

472
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,572
Impossible. You're lying.

473
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:15,932
He was fine before.

474
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:18,092
Chengfeng couldn't be dead.
It's not possible.

475
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,531
You must be lying to me.

476
00:28:19,812 --> 00:28:20,531
Take her away.

477
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:21,892
Let go of me.

478
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:22,531
Go.

479
00:28:22,691 --> 00:28:23,491
Release me.

480
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:26,092
Let go of me.

481
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:28,412
Just kill me.

482
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:30,051
Otherwise, I'll make you die
in a gutter.

483
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:33,572
You have a pretty face

484
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:36,332
but a sharp tongue.

485
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:39,372
Moreover, I promised General Xu
to keep you alive.

486
00:28:39,932 --> 00:28:41,691
So how could I possibly kill you?

487
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:44,051
(Keep me alive?)

488
00:28:45,372 --> 00:28:47,011
(No wonder you made me promise)

489
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,172
(to live no matter what happens.)

490
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:52,892
(You actually sacrificed yourself
to save my life.)

491
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:58,211
General Xu looked miserable

492
00:28:58,812 --> 00:29:00,172
when he was dying.

493
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:01,971
Before his death,

494
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:04,211
he struggled painfully

495
00:29:04,332 --> 00:29:06,412
while desperately begging me
to spare him.

496
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,491
Even I felt heartache seeing that scene.

497
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:13,572
I know you're a tough woman.

498
00:29:13,932 --> 00:29:15,172
But your husband

499
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:17,932
exchanged his life for yours.

500
00:29:18,572 --> 00:29:20,092
Don't let his sacrifice be in vain.

501
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:22,691
If you create the developing water
for me,

502
00:29:23,172 --> 00:29:24,652
I will release you

503
00:29:24,652 --> 00:29:25,812
and the Shen family.

504
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:27,332
Otherwise,

505
00:29:27,852 --> 00:29:29,451
I have plenty of ways

506
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:31,612
to make you wish you were dead.

507
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,652
You think it over carefully.

508
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:36,092
Wait.

509
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:38,892
Have you made your decision?

510
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:40,491

511
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:42,932
that Chengfeng is already dead,

512
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:47,572
I must go to pay my respects
and offer incense for him.

513
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:49,731
Otherwise,

514
00:29:51,051 --> 00:29:52,971
I won't make the developing water.

515
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:55,531
Fine, as you wish.

516
00:29:56,132 --> 00:29:57,011
However, I warn you

517
00:29:57,932 --> 00:29:59,211
not to play any tricks.

518
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:00,932
It will be arranged tomorrow.

so he allowed someone to accompany you.

589
00:35:21,971 --> 00:35:22,932

or death anymore.

For him,

614
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,372
I will live well.

615
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:25,451
I won't let his sacrifice be in vain.

616
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:27,571

Miss Shen made a wise decision.

621

I'm glad to hear that.

622
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:13,212

you will be fine.

But if you make any moves,

628
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:29,651
I will definitely not spare you again.

629
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:45,651
Wait.

630
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:53,011
What tricks are you playing now?

631
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:06,531
I found this in father's room.

632
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:09,772
(Luo Xue'er's identity)
Identity statement?

633
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:12,171
Father had already made plans for you.

634
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,692
He found a dead prisoner similar
in stature and appearance to you

635
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,051
to take your place in a ghost marriage.

636
00:38:16,332 --> 00:38:19,451
He would send you to the suburban estate
and change your identity.

637
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:21,091
With a new identity,

638
00:38:21,892 --> 00:38:23,531
you can not only get rid of Ms. Zhou

639
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,171
but also live the life you want.

640
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,932
Please, father. Don't make me go through
with the ghost marriage.

641
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:32,892
- I beg you.
- Xue'er.

642
00:38:32,892 --> 00:38:33,772
- Please.
- Xue'er, get up.

643
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:35,051
Xue'er.

644
00:38:36,451 --> 00:38:38,131
Xue'er, listen to me.

645
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:39,692
I've arranged everything.

646
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:40,932
If you do it...

647
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:41,932
Why me?

648
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:44,971
Why not Ailian or Shuangshuang?

649
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:49,491
Is it because I'm not
your biological daughter?

650
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:51,531
I will die.

651
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:53,812
I know you can't let your daughters die.

652
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:55,292
How did you know?

653
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:57,332
Although I'm not your birth father,

654
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:58,611
over the years,

655
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:00,332
I have not slighted you in any way.

656
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:03,171
This is the only feasible way.

657
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:05,051
You must follow my arrangements.

658
00:39:06,852 --> 00:39:08,292
No, I won't listen to you.

659
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:09,611
- Xue'er.
- I won't.

660
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:10,932
- Xue'er.
- I won't.

661
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:17,412
Xue'er.

662
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:24,692
Father.

663
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:26,451
Father, are you alright?

664
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:28,852
Father, are you alright?

665
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:32,451
You must

666
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:35,292
follow my arrangements.

667
00:39:36,932 --> 00:39:38,171
That's what he said

668
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:40,611
the only feasible way?

669
00:39:41,971 --> 00:39:44,332
So he never intended
to put me through the ghost marriage.

670
00:39:44,692 --> 00:39:47,332
Father is the only one
in this world who loves you most.

671
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,692
Yet you killed him with your own hands.

672
00:39:50,852 --> 00:39:52,332
If you have your humanity,

673
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,011
mend your ways

674
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:55,571
and confess your guilt.

675
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:59,332
Following Prince Yi
is undoubtedly wrong.

676
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:01,611
Sooner or later, you will be destroyed

678
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,011
I don't believe it.

679
00:40:15,732 --> 00:40:18,451
Why are you telling me this now?

680
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:21,531
I can't turn back now.

681
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:27,692
I am not wrong.

682
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:29,531
It's all your fault.

683
