(Luo Residence)

4
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,140
Miss Xue'er.

5
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,741
How is it?

6
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,541
This is the wine
based on the secret recipe.

7
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,541
Please have a taste.

8
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,980
Have the brewers tasted it yet?

9
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,060
They have, and they said
the flavor was fine.

10
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,340
It's ready for production.

11
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,461
Good.

12
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,461
Have them work overnight

13
00:01:58,461 --> 00:01:59,581
and produce as much as possible.

14
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,140
This time, I must crush Shen Danqing.

15
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:03,541
Yes.

16
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,861
(Ganlu Brewery)
Come on, please come inside.

17
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,500
We have everything. Come on.

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,776
(New Product Rose Drink, Very Mellow)

19
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,660
Please, come in.

20
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,820
New product?

21
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,461
Miss.

22
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:37,780
Are they the same 'rose'?

23
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,220
Mr. Lin, go buy a jar to try it.

24
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,741
I want to see

25
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:44,940
what tricks they are playing.

26
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:45,780
Yes.

27
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,581
It smells quite similar
to our Rose Liquor.

28
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,021
Isn't this just our Rose Liquor?

29
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,701
How did they know how to brew it?

30
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,861
So the trouble they
caused in our shop a few days ago

31
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,500
had an ulterior motive
related to the wine.

32
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,461
Miss, what should we do now?

33
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:24,301
Young Master has gone
to escort the cargo.

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,620
Should we call him back now?

35
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,421
No.

36
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:28,660
The cargo is for a longtime client.

37
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,620
My brother values it highly.
We must not disturb him.

38
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:34,340
Then we must come up
with a countermeasure.

39
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,421
A halo around the moon brings wind,
and moistened earth brings rain.

40
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,620
Now the bedrock is moist.

41
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,741
It seems

42
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:51,901
a heavy rain is imminent.

43
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,008
(Rose Drink)

44
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:19,941
Miss, there's been no order in days.

45
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,100
Should we also lower our prices?

46
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,220
We'll sell as much as we can.

47
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:25,941
Otherwise, we won't even be able
to make it through the month.

48
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,780
If we price ours lower
than Ganlu Brewery,

49
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,141
the more we sell, the more we lose.

50
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:34,261
I've already sent a message to Zishan,

51
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,141
asking him to help contact a few

52
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:38,021
major clients from other counties
on his way back.

53
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:41,261
Let's hope distant water
can quench the immediate thirst.

54
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,100
Mmm.

55
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,941
Right, Miss.

56
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,180
The oilcloth used
for storing wine is broken.

57
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,461
Should we buy another piece?

58
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,141
Yes, indeed.

59
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,941
The rainy season is coming soon.

60
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:52,740
Rose Liquor

61
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,581
is most susceptible to humidity
and can easily spoil.

62
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,461
Umbrellas and raincoats
are made of oilcloth.

63
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,100
Let's tear it off and make do with it.

64
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:01,980
Yes.

65
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,980
Thank you, General.

66
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,860
What brings you here?

67
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,100
Has the new wine been brewed?

68
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,860
Here they are.

69
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,941
Among them, Rose Liquor
is the best seller.

70
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,141
Next to it, 'Dreamy Drunk'

71
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:36,461
is brewed with winter dream flowers.

72
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:39,061
It's sweet to the taste
but very easy to get drunk on,

73
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,220
hence the name.

74
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:42,860
Dreamy Drunk?

75
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:48,220
Great wine!

76
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,021
General, you're not here
to mooch off some wine today, are you?

77
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:55,461
What? Can't I?

78
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:58,340
Of course you can. It's just that
the wine is strong.

79
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,061
If you keep drinking it,

80
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:01,701
you might really end up
in a drunken stupor.

81
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,860
I consider you a close confidant.

82
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:06,540
So I want to enjoy a drink
and a dreamy chat with you.

83
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,901
With the Festival,

84
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,540
we need two hundred catties of wine

85
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,220
to reward my guards.

86
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:13,780
I'll take the Rose Liquor
you just mentioned.

87
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,780
General, you should know

88
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,581
that Ganlu Brewery has put out a product

89
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,220
that tastes exactly like Rose Liquor,

90
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:22,740
and it's 20 percent cheaper.

91
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,021
I've heard about it.

92
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:26,660
But I am more willing
to trust your character and ability.

93
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,021
So, I came here.

94
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,941
If you come here to buy wine,

95
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,581
people will surely gossip,

96
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,461
saying that you've fallen
for my charms so much

97
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:35,860
that you'd buy wine
from Danqing Winery at a high price

98
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,420
rather than purchasing
the cheap Rose Drink.

99
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,660
I always do what I believe is right.

100
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,740
I don't care how others see me.

101
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:46,300
However, if you care about those rumors,

102
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,621
that's a different matter.

103
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,420
Of course, I don't mind.

104
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,340
- I'm just worried about you...
- Deal, then.

105
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:52,300
Rose Liquor.

106
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,660
Miss Shen, please help me
load the carriage.

107
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:57,621
Thank you, General.

108
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,300
I appreciate your kindness.

109
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,261
I'll go prepare it now.

110
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:04,141
Okay.

111
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,660
(Danqing Winery)

112
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,420
General.

113
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,780
- Take care, sir.
- Okay.

114
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:18,300
Tianhao, is everything loaded?

115
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:19,821
Yeah.

116
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,901
But when moving the wine just now,

117
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,901
I found a jar sealed with red cloth.

118
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,261
Seems to be on the house.

119
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,501
Miss Shen really doesn't
let you suffer any loss.

120
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,540
They say the Rose Liquor
has a sweet taste

121
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,621
and a floral fragrance.

122
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:32,860
You won't get drunk easily.

123
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:35,061
Today, I have
the opportunity to taste it.

124
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:40,821
Are you alright?

125
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,261
Did you say it had a sweet taste?

126
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,261
But...

127
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,581
Could it be Miss Shen
took the wrong one?

128
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,100
Chengfeng?

129
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:55,740
This is not Rose Liquor.

130
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,660
Only this one.

131
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:04,860
It must have been a special one.

132
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,901
This wine borrows your name.

133
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,461
I guess Miss Shen thinks that you

134
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,660
always scare people

135
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:13,701
and demand a lot,

136
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:14,901
so she named

137
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,420
this strong liquor after you.

138
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:18,621
Tianhao, say it again.

139
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,021
This wine borrows your name.

140
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,420
Surely Miss Shen thinks you

141
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,821
are as extraordinary
as this strong liquor.

142
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:37,501
(So the extra wine)

143
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:39,460
(was brewed especially for me.)

144
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,660
General.

145
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,341
This wine is, after all,
a token of Miss Shen's kindness.

146
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,221
Even if you find it unpleasant to drink,

147
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,021
- don't...
- Chengfeng Wine.

148
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:51,741
Truly extraordinary indeed.

149
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:54,101
Are you okay, General?

150
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,141
Is this wine that strong?

151
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,741
Let me try it too.

152
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
This jar of wine is mine.

153
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,660
Choose any from the carriage.

154
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,580
Back to the mansion. Let's hurry.

155
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:09,700
General.

156
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:11,621
General!

157
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:15,580
Let's go.

158
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,060
These twenty jars of wine
will be delivered to your residence.

159
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:19,901
Okay, make sure they arrive on time.

160
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:20,580
- Of course.
- Okay.

161
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,540
Please settle the bill here.

162
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,101
How is it?

163
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:28,780
Miss Xue'er.

164
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,901
Look, the wine we've sold
over the past few days

165
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,621
matches the monthly profit

166
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:35,660
of usual sales.

167
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,981
All thanks to this secret recipe,

168
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:38,981
our Rose Drink

169
00:09:38,981 --> 00:09:41,101
has the same taste
as Danqing Winery's Rose Liquor,

170
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:43,141
but the price is 20 percent lower.

171
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,141
So naturally, everyone
comes to buy from us.

172
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,700
Many regular customers

173
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:48,141
worry that the price might go up,

174
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,460
so they buy more to stock up.

175
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:55,180
Has there been any movement
at Danqing Winery these days?

176
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,621
We're watching them, as you instructed.

177
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,501
Not even one customer comes every day.

178
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:03,341
Although, General Xu
did go and buy some wine.

179
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,580
However,

180
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:06,501
it's just a drop in the bucket.

181
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,820
It's Xu Chengfeng again.

182
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,060
Shen Danqing does know how to find help.

183
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,820
He can't stem the tide alone.

184
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,460
They're barely holding up.

185
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:18,021
They'd rather sell
the brewing ingredients

186
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:19,300
than lower prices.

187
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,101
Shen Danqing is a smart person.

188
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,780
She knows that if she were
to engage in a price war with me,

189
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,820
Danqing Winery would surely lose money.

190
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:28,300
Even if she had a joyful ride
with a recipe from somewhere,

191
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,540
she couldn't master
the wine business so quickly.

192
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,981
Pretending to be tough,

193
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,580
but she must be panicking inside.

194
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,460
You're wise, Miss Xue'er.

195
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,060
But we need to stay on point.

196
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,021
Shen Danqing is crafty.

197
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,341
We have to personally see
that she's out of options.

198
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:49,501
Come on, let's take a look.

199
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,981
Okay.

200
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,741
I have already calculated it.

201
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,700
If Zishan can seal the deal
with the neighboring county,

202
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:01,341
we can sell off half of our inventory

203
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,981
and pay off the debts
for the ingredients.

204
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,060
But if the ingredients and yeast
are not used for brewing soon,

205
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,700
they will expire.

206
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,420
Miss, what should we do then?

207
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:16,101
Why not sell the yeast
and ingredients to me?

208
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,341
Our wine is in short supply.

209
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,700
I was worried
about the yeast and ingredients.

210
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:23,021
What are you doing here?

211
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,901
Miss Shen, how do you
have accounts to settle?

212
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:28,660
I see.

213
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,981
You're calculating the losses, right?

214
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,741
It's broad daylight and not
a soul is in sight. Such desolation.

215
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,901
It's truly terrible.

216
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:42,300
Miss Shen, please don't be angry.

217
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,700
I'm here today to help you.

218
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,501
Stop shedding crocodile tears.

219
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,540
You stole our young lady's
brewing recipe.

220
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,741
And now you have the audacity
to come here and spout nonsense.

221
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,060
The traitor of the Luo family.

222
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:57,261
Don't talk nonsense without evidence.

223
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,141
Or I'll send you to the authorities.

224
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:03,981
Miss Shen.

225
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,540
As I just said,

226
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:08,420
I truly came here with the utmost
sincerity to help you today.

227
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:10,221
If you agree,

228
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,780
I'll put aside past grudges
and show you a clear path.

229
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,101
Ganlu Brewery can
buy out Danqing Winery.

230
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:19,940
I will hire you
to be the wine saleswoman in my store.

231
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:21,660
How about it?

232
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,300
Okay.

233
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:31,540
Miss Xue'er!

234
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,861
You... What?

235
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:33,780
How dare you?

236
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:39,460
You really can't afford to lose.

237
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,700
You have no decency.

238
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,660
Decency?

239
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:45,580
You tried to kill me with
poisonous spiders in the yamen prison.

240
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,580
Have you forgotten that?

241
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,300
And you talk to me about decency?

242
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,741
Haven't you played your part enough?

243
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,981
Life is like a play,
and a play is like life.

244
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:54,901
When it comes to acting, it seems
I'm no match for you, Miss Shen.

245
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,216
Weren't you poisoned
and near death in prison?

246
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
But in the blink of an eye,
you blackmailed a jailer

247
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:02,101
and got General Xu to bail you out.

248
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:03,861
At the ceremony,

249
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,312
didn't you also put on a big act
and steal my spring water?

250
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,621
Save it.

251
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:10,420
Stop pretending

252
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,981
as if you're a paragon
of virtue and openness.

253
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:19,300
Fine.

254
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
Since you are unwilling
to do business with Ganlu Brewery,

255
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,861
wait to be broke then.

256
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,940
Do you want to be slapped again?

257
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:28,700
Get out of here!

258
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:35,700
Shen Danqing.

259
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,940
Even with General Xu's support,

260
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,820
it's no help at all.

261
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,700
You can't beat me.

262
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,540
You'll end up on the streets
as a wine-selling woman.

263
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:01,700
Shen Danqing.

264
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,540
You dare to hit me?

265
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,981
It seems you're really out of options.

266
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,820
You can't even keep your cool.

267
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,700
I will make you

268
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,580
pay for this slap.

269
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:14,780
Laifu.

270
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:17,700
Go talk to Chairman Xia and have him

271
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:19,780
inform the liquor
merchants in Liao City.

272
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,861
No one can buy Shen Danqing's
yeast or ingredients.

273
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,060
I want to make her lose
all her invested money!

274
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,460
Yes.

275
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,420
(I've told you many times
that I'm already well.)

276
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,180
I don't need it.

277
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:38,741
As Miss Xue'er said,

278
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
the general is on to Madam's case.

279
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,540
If you go back now,

280
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:44,741
I'm afraid you might be
thrown into prison.

281
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,780
It's very dangerous.

282
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:47,940
You've fooled me
with that several times.

283
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,981
Tomorrow is my mother's birthday.

284
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:51,261
I must go back.

285
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,101
I won't listen to you this time.

286
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,460
Prepare a horse for me.

287
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,101
Miss, you should just stay put.

288
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:58,981
Watch yourself.

289
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,420
It's Miss Xue'er's instruction

290
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,580
that you stay here and recuperate.

291
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,101
If you behave,

292
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,261
everything will be just fine.

293
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:07,300
But if you run around recklessly

294
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,501
and something happens,

295
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,460
it will have nothing to do with us.

296
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:13,221
What? What are you saying?

297
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,060
You...

298
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,420
Open the door!

299
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,460
Open the door!

300
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,700
Luo Xue'er.

301
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,221
So you're locking me up here

302
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,741
using the illness as an excuse.

303
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,021
Open the door.

304
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,660
Luo Xue'er!

305
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:31,060
Open the door!

306
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,660
Danqing, I'm back.

307
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:36,180
Miss Shen.

308
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,700
Miss Shen.

309
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:37,420
Go and rest.

310
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:38,221
Yes.

311
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:39,940
Zishan, how was the trip?

312
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:42,101
It was fine.

313
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,060
Then,

314
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:47,780
how about the customers
I asked you to look for?

315
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,540
Councilor Meng is an old patron
of our Shen Escort Agency.

316
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:51,940
He trusts us a lot.

317
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:53,420
He agreed without hesitation.

318
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:58,141
Such good news

319
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:00,221
should be shared with others.

320
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,060
Miss Xue'er. Miss Xue'er.

321
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,861
Something terrible has happened!

322
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,341
What's the panic?

323
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,700
Danqing Winery has taken a large order.

324
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,621
What?

325
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,660
Councilor Meng's grandparent
is celebrating their birthday.

326
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,261
To show his filial piety, Councilor Meng

327
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:22,060
is hosting a banquet.

328
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:25,660
And he's using Danqing Winery's
Rose Liquor as the birthday wine.

329
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:29,141
Currently, Danqing Winery is buying
a large amount of yeast and ingredients.

330
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,341
In that case,

331
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,341
with this order, Shen Danqing

332
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,940
will have a break.

333
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:37,700
It's not just that.

334
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,420
If this deal is sealed,

335
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,341
the wine used in the homes of those
who deal with Councilor Meng

336
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,141
will all be from Danqing Winery.

337
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,261
The Rose Liquor will sell very well.

338
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:50,420
No, we can't give her
a chance to turn things around.

339
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,660
Go.

340
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,741
Take the money we've earned these days

341
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:55,420
and make sure

342
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,261
to buy up all the raw materials
for brewing Rose Drink

343
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,021
in Liao City
and the neighboring villages.

344
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,861
Even at a high price,

345
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:03,300
we must not leave her even a tiny bit.

346
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,940
Invest everything?

347
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:06,500
Fortune favors the bold.

348
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:07,341
If we don't crush her,

349
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,420
how can we survive?

350
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:10,020
Listen.

351
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:12,500
Leave the matter
of the ingredients to someone else.

352
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,500
You take the Rose Drink

353
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:16,020
and go to see Councilor Meng.

354
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:16,940
Okay.

355
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,700
Tell him

356
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:19,821
that Shen Danqing
lacks the ability to deliver,

357
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,901
and Ganlu Brewery is the best
among Liao City's liquor stores.

358
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,581
The Rose Drink I brew
is better than Rose Liquor,

359
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:27,420
with a 20 percent lower price.

360
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,020
To show sincerity,

361
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:30,980
Ganlu Brewery will cover the deposit

362
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:33,420
he gave to Danqing Winery.

363
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:36,101
Yes.

364
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,180
Such a good opportunity.

365
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,940
You want me to give it to you?

366
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:47,341
You wish.

367
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,740
Miss, Luo Xue'er has snatched
Councilor Meng's order.

368
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,541
She's determined
to compete with us to the end.

369
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,821
Even if we want to fight her,
we don't have the ingredients.

370
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,061
Now we're really in trouble.

371
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:05,460
Shuixian.

372
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,180
I need to be alone. You can go back now.

373
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,260
Miss.

374
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:13,821
Go back.

375
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:17,341
Yes.

376
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,420
Sir, Ganlu Brewery's
new product, Rose Drink.

377
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,020
Come on in.

378
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,781
(It's raining.)

379
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,581
I forgot to bring an umbrella.

380
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,581
I've been preparing it for you.

381
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:03,980
Ever since the rainy season,
I always carry an umbrella.

382
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,901
Just for this day.

383
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,061
Tianhao, give me the umbrella.

384
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
General, don't be so moved.

385
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,781
I can hold it up.

386
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:18,901
You've worked so hard. Let me take it.

387
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,660
Come on.

388
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:20,460
Mmm.

389
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,301
Thank you, General.

390
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,861
I am truly flattered.

391
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:29,420
I'll go to Danqing Winery.

392
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,220
You can go home now.

393
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,460
I'm not flattered.

394
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:36,260
I'm flattened.

395
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,700
(All the raincoats and umbrellas
were used as waterproof cloth.)

396
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,700
(What should I do now?)

397
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,660
General Xu, what brings you here?

398
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,740
The last time I came, I noticed

399
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,581
Shuixian had removed the oilcloth
from the umbrellas,

400
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,740
so I knew you wouldn't have an umbrella.

401
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:09,821
So being helpful,
I came to take you home.

402
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,341
Young Master, please have some tea.

403
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,141
It's raining outside.

404
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,660
Has Danqing returned?

405
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:45,341
She said she wanted to be alone

406
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,660
and might come back later.

407
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,180
She told me to go home first.

408
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:07,341
Miss Shen, I have received
the wine you gave me.

409
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,101
Specially named after me

410
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,180
and carefully brewed.

411
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:11,660
I'm grateful.

412
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,020
This 'Chengfeng' is not just your name.

413
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,581
Just like the Qizi pastries you gave me,

414
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:18,541
wishing me luck,

415
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,220
Chengfeng Wine's taste is strong,

416
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,301
hoping that the person who drinks it

417
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,821
can stay brave and passionate.

418
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:25,901
No matter what storms they face,

419
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,141
they shall rise above them.

420
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,781
Well said.

421
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,821
This 'Chengfeng' is not just my name.

422
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,861
Now I am really curious.

423
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,061
To you,

424
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,660
what am I really like?

425
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,500
You're a fierce

426
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,901
and unapproachable general.

427
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,180
But it was my first impression.

428
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,781
After getting to know you, I found you
to be brave and resourceful,

429
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,500
warm and straightforward.

430
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,740
This wine has a strong taste at first,

431
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:57,940
but after a moment, there is
a sweet aftertaste.

432
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:00,901
It's somewhat similar
to how you just described me.

433
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,940
If that's the case, the wine
should be even stronger,

434
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,740
letting the first sip
take your breath away.

435
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:12,341
Are you still mad at me
for throwing you into the water?

436
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,821
I might remember this
for the rest of my life.

437
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,700
If you do,

438
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:19,581
I shall apologize for a lifetime.

439
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:23,660
Be careful.

440
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,420
Thank you, General.

441
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:30,420
You're welcome.

442
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:32,660
Guess I need to double the effort

443
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,260
to remove my bad
impression in your heart.

444
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,101
I'll look forward

445
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,940
to your performance to come.

You're home.
Take the umbrella and go in.

453
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,861
I wouldn't want you to catch a cold.

454
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,660
I let you walk me back
so that you would take the umbrella.

455
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:17,980
You have to cross the yard
from here to get to your room.

456
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:19,621
If you get caught in the rain,

457
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,180
my efforts today will be in vain.

458
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,821
General, compared to when we first met,

459
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
you are quite different.

460
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,980
You're flattering me.

461
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,180
I'm already home.

462
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,141
Take this umbrella back, please.

463
00:23:33,141 --> 00:23:34,621
I've seen a lot worse.

464
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,301
This bit of wind and rain is nothing.

465
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,141
Take it and go back quickly.

00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:44,744

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,581
Mmm.

475
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,301
Drink this.

476
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:22,341
Thanks.

477
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:28,581
I've heard

478
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,460
that Luo Xue'er has bought up
all the wine-making ingredients.

479
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,901
Let her do as she pleases.

480
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,420
Having a bowl of ginger soup
cooked by my brother

481
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,020
on this rainy day,

482
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:40,061
I'm quite content.

483
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,260
It seems

484
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:43,781
I must have worried unnecessarily.

485
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:52,980
You've been quite close
to General Xu lately, haven't you?

486
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,180
He's been helping a lot.

487
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,740
I heard about him
buying wine to help out.

488
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,460
Ever since we had
an open talk last time,

489
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:05,980
he has indeed been much warmer to us.

490
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,500
After getting to know him,
I found that General Xu

491
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,420
appears to be unrestrained,

492
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,901
but he is very thoughtful

493
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:14,180
and takes care of people.

494
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,740
Chengfeng is indeed a rare gentleman.

495
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,781
He is a trustworthy

496
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:21,541
close friend.

497
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,460
A close friend.

498
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,141
Indeed.

499
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:29,740
You're tired. Rest early.

500
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,180
Drink up.

501
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,020
Have a cup of hot tea.

502
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:01,901
General.

503
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,460
Did Miss Shen put something
in your wine,

504
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,781
like a love potion?

505
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:07,980
Whenever it comes to Miss Shen,

506
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,621
you become different. Why?

507
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,341
You talk a lot.

508
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,980
Did you take care of the tasks
I assigned to you?

509
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,660
I've been observing

510
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:21,500
Lv Zhu and Prince Yi.

511
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:23,061
There's been nothing.

512
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,541
I've checked the notes passed on

513
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,500
by Lv Zhu for reporting.

514
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:28,180
They are just daily trivial matters.

515
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:31,500
Daily trivial matters are not damaging.

516
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:33,180
Just let her report them to Prince Yi.

517
00:26:34,141 --> 00:26:36,420
We must allow her
to report back some news.

518
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,101
Otherwise, Prince Yi
might resort to other tactics

519
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:40,541
and catch us off guard.

520
00:26:40,781 --> 00:26:41,980
That makes sense.

521
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,220
It's not good for you
to keep pushing her away.

522
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:47,341
That's right.

523
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,020
In that case,

524
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,101
you should try to get along

525
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,541
with Miss Lv Zhu.

526
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,220
Why me?

527
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,341
Don't worry, I have already
instructed Lv Zhu

528
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:00,781
to take good care of you.

529
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:02,700
General?

530
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,861
General, don't leave.

531
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,101
General Tianhao.

532
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,341
I'm coming in, okay?

533
00:27:15,821 --> 00:27:16,940
General Tianhao.

534
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,101
General Tianhao.

535
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:29,901
General Tianhao.

536
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,020
General Tianhao.

537
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:33,341
General Tianhao.

538
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:35,740
General told me you were not sleeping.

539
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,500
General Tianhao, get up.

540
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,781
What are you doing?

541
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,341
General Tianhao, you're not
pretending to sleep anymore?

542
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,740
Your forehead is a bit hot.

543
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,660
This is the ginger soup I made for you.

544
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:52,061
It can relieve the cold.

545
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,660
Take a sip.

546
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:56,020
Have a taste.

547
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,180
Why is it so spicy?

548
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,980
See, I knew you would find it spicy.

549
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,220
This is a throat-soothing candy I made

550
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,781
with honeysuckle, mint, and licorice.

551
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:21,101
If you caught a chill,
your throat might feel uncomfortable.

552
00:28:21,621 --> 00:28:22,341
Eat this.

553
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,101
(It couldn't be poisoned, could it?)

554
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,500
Rest assured, I would not poison you.

555
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:38,061
Here.

556
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,260
How is it? I didn't lie to you, did I?

557
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,420
Mm.

558
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,901
Quickly, drink the ginger soup.

559
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,740
Okay.

560
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:50,504
Drink up.

561
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,460
I have a few more here for you.

562
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,180
Thank you, Miss Lv Zhu.

563
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:06,420
Good boy.

564
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:07,980
Remember to rest well.

565
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,740
(It feels pretty good
to be taken care of.)

566
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,020
Miss Lv Zhu.

567
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,420
Could you please have
these clothes washed by noon?

568
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:32,260
Also, the flowers and plants
in this courtyard

569
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:34,541
need to be watered every morning.

570
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,101
Why should I do your tasks?

571
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,101
You claim to be
the general's personal maid.

572
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:40,581
Shouldn't you be scrambling to do

573
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,020
these bootlicking jobs?

574
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,101
I'm giving you a chance.

575
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:45,020
Forget about it.

576
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,740
She's always made a fool of herself
by the general and Tianhao.

577
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,101
She has many schemes

578
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,740
yet all of them are useless.

579
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,341
She's just a joke.

580
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,460
You're so mean!

581
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,420
How dare you smash me? Watch it.

582
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,541
Stop.

583
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,581
How dare you bully others?

584
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:03,700
Miss Lv Zhu is simple-minded.

585
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,901
Stop your reckless fabrications.

586
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,861
We're sorry. We won't do it again.

587
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:10,301
Whoever dares to bully her again

588
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,301
will be kicked out of here.

589
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,141
Understood.

590
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:22,216
(Ganlu Brewery)

591
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,541
Miss Xue'er, the accounts
have been settled.

592
00:30:24,901 --> 00:30:27,341
This batch of Rose Drink
has been sold out.

593
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,581
As you ordered,

594
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:31,460
I've used all the available money

595
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,621
to purchase ingredients and

596
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:33,581
use them in production.

597
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:34,621
This batch of wine

598
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,781
will be brewed in just a few days.

599
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:37,420
Good.

600
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:39,260
Keep an eye on Shen Danqing.

601
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:41,101
Don't give her any chance
to catch her breath.

602
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,861
I want to leave her with no wine
to brew and sell.

603
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:46,940
She won't last ten days

604
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,781
before quitting the wine business
and shutting down for good.

605
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,301
You're wise indeed.

606
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:54,141
That newcomer, Shen Danqing,

607
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:55,341
can't compete with you.

608
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:57,101
She's overestimating herself.

609
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:00,781
Perhaps it's the buyers.

610
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,260
Why have they arrived so early?

611
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,061
Open the door.
Don't keep the guests waiting.

612
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:04,660
Alright.

613
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,700
- Open up!
- Open up!

614
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
- Easy.
- Welcome...

615
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:09,781
We want refunds.
You actually sold fake wine.

616
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,220
This wine spoiled just after a few days.

617
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,141
Refund!

618
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:15,660
We want refunds.

619
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:17,061
- Open up!
- Open up!

620
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,460
Open the door.

621
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:19,940
Open the door.

622
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,500
Miss, what's going on there?

623
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,541
There are so many people
at the gate of Ganlu Brewery.

624
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,821
Luo Xue'er has finally taken the fall.

625
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,901
All thanks to Miss Shen.

626
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,220
Luo Xue'er wanted to pull a scam

627
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,700
to conceal her real purpose,

628
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:33,901
then played another trick

629
00:31:34,141 --> 00:31:35,500
to steal my recipe.

630
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:37,500
If I didn't play along,

631
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,500
her elaborate scheme would be a waste.

632
00:31:41,581 --> 00:31:42,700
So I dismissed

633
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,901
all the people in the backyard,

634
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,460
so that person could do as he please.

635
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,861
This wine is bad. Refund us.

636
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,141
- Refund!
- Refund!

637
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,541
This wine is bad. Have them refund it.

638
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,180
Refund. We want refunds.

639
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,821
Refund. We want refunds.

640
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,500
Danqing Winery seeks profit
at the cost of lives. Refund!

641
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,621
(This person is deliberately
inciting trouble. Something's wrong.)

642
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:06,660
Refund!

643
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,460
(Why does he look so familiar?)

644
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,220
Refund!

645
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,901
Go follow that bearded man.

646
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:13,740
Don't startle him.

647
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
See what he's up to.

648
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,781
- We want refunds.
- Yes.

649
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:17,180
(That person sneaked into the storeroom)

650
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,061
and stole our Rose Liquor recipe.

651
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
Later, I found out

652
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,141
he was Laifu, the steward
of the Luo Residence.

653
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:28,020
Why did you let him
take away the recipe?

654
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,500
I see.

655
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,621
The recipe Laifu stole must be fake.

656
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:32,581
The recipe was real.

657
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,500
Luo Xue'er is cunning.

658
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,980
If she were given a fake recipe,

659
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,061
she wouldn't copy it.

660
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,341
But the wine's recipe
is the foundation of a brewer.

661
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,180
To guard against any contingency,

662
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,341
I omitted the most important steps.

663
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,220
And the most important thing
about Rose Liquor is the storage time.

664
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,700
To Luo Xue'er,

665
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,180
I'm an outsider to winemaking.

666
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:57,180
She surely can't imagine
that I would retreat to advance

667
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
and lay another trap.

668
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,980
No wonder

669
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:03,141
every time they make wine,
you will have the brewers

670
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:04,141
leave for two hours

671
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,260
and busy yourself alone in the brewery.

672
00:33:06,581 --> 00:33:09,141
You must have been
working on that crucial step.

673
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,460
Exactly.

674
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,420
Although this recipe can brew

675
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,821
a wine that tastes
just like Rose Liquor,

676
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:15,700
it is hard to store.

677
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,700
Moreover, the current rainy season

678
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,101
further shortens the wine's shelf life.

679
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,180
I see it now.

680
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,781
However, Miss.

681
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:29,660
The brewers
of the Luo family are no amateurs.

682
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:31,220
He will find out sooner or later.

683
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:34,341
Even if Luo Xue'er incurs losses,
they won't be too substantial.

684
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:37,220
How did you figure
she would increase production?

685
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,061
A fish swallows the hook for the bait.

686
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:42,020
This recipe made Luo Xue'er a fortune.

687
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,141
Money blinds.

688
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:48,740
If a person's greed is unsatisfied,
and their intentions are evil,

689
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:50,581
they are sure to reap what they sow.

690
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:53,821
Plus, Luo Xue'er
is too eager to see me fail,

691
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,581
so I put on an act with my brother,

692
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:57,740
pretending to make a comeback.

693
00:33:58,341 --> 00:33:59,861
She will therefore disregard everything.

694
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,980
By the time she realizes
something's wrong with the wine,

695
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,541
it will already be too late.

696
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:07,141
Miss, you are truly amazing.

697
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,420
You made her stock up a large amount
of ingredients to brew wine,

698
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,060
and then you took advantage
of the rainy season

699
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,620
to accelerate
the spoilage of Rose Drink.

700
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,861
In this way,

701
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,100
she has no choice but to lose all.

702
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:19,701
However, Miss.

703
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,500
I've been so worried,

704
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,901
yet you didn't let on at all.

705
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,261
There can be no slip-ups
with this matter.

706
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,500
So the fewer people knew, the better.

707
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:31,861
I acted as if Luo Xue'er had enraged me

708
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,221
to make her feel

709
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,701
that we had no way out.

710
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,580
All of the Luo family's scheming

711
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:39,781
was in your calculations.

712
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,741
And you countered her every move.

713
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:43,980
It is truly brilliant.

714
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:46,060
I am sincerely impressed.

715
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,460
Miss, your strategizing is ingenious.

716
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,741
There isn't a problem you can't solve.

717
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,661
It's a rare lively day today.

718
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:54,781
The lead in this farce

719
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:56,741
is the best actress.

720
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:58,620
How could we miss such a good play?

721
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:01,940
Open the door.

722
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,741
Open the door.

723
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:08,420
Hold it. Hold it.

724
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:11,661
Shen Danqing must have
tampered with the recipe.

725
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:13,861
So she set me up afterward.

726
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:15,140
Miss Xue'er.

727
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,301
We spent all our available money
on raw materials,

728
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:19,661
and they have been put into production.

729
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,861
- Oh no...
- Don't panic.

730
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,701
Hold it. Hold it tightly.

731
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,460
Calm them down now.

732
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,181
- Open the door.
- Open it!

733
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:37,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
please calm down and move back.

734
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,020
Our owner will say something.

735
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,901
Please hear me out.

736
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,701
- Take it easy.
- Everyone, please hear me out.

737
00:35:41,781 --> 00:35:42,861
Please rest assured, everyone.

738
00:35:42,861 --> 00:35:44,580
Ganlu Brewery has been
in Liao City for long.

739
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:46,261
We will not betray everyone's trust.

740
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,741
I will definitely refund everyone.

741
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:50,460
Tell us when you will refund the money.

742
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,940
Yes, tell us when.

743
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,580
Refund!

744
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,580
Everyone, please be patient.

745
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,301
You can follow Laifu

746
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,701
to register the refund amount.

747
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,301
Give us three days.

748
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,701
In three days, I will surely
have the money prepared

749
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:03,821
and wait for you
in the main hall of Ganlu Brewery.

750
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,500
What if you run away by then?

751
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,341
Right, what if you run away?

752
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,701
The Luo family's properties,

753
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,020
our mansion and families are all here.

754
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:12,580
Where could we possibly run to?

755
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:13,580
Everyone, trust me.

756
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,500
We can afford the refunds.

757
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:17,661
It's just the shop's funding

758
00:36:17,661 --> 00:36:18,781
has been invested in production,

759
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,100
and we're short in cash.

760
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,500
So, please give me a little time.

761
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,821
As I promised,

762
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,420
in three days, I'll be
waiting here for everyone.

763
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:33,661
At that time, I will return the money
to everyone without a penny missing.

764
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:35,901
Then everyone, please register first.

765
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,821
- Come to me.
- Register first.

766
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,221
Come in.

767
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,100
We will give you the money.

768
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,020
- Don't worry.
- Come on.

769
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,500
This way. Come on.

770
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,261
Refund?

771
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,980
Where will she get the money
to refund the customers?

772
00:36:58,741 --> 00:36:59,861
She bought a large amount

773
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:02,221
of grain to make liquor.

774
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:04,540
If I haven't miscalculated,

775
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,580
she should be out of money.

776
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:08,580
I think she's bluffing

777
00:37:09,341 --> 00:37:11,020
and making time to run away.

778
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:13,020
We mustn't take this lightly.

779
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:16,940
Shuixian, do something for me.

780
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,861
Know-it-all sent someone
to arrange a meeting here,

781
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:25,540
saying they had found key evidence.

782
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
I didn't expect
such quick progress this time.

783
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:53,020
She was killed
by a poison-coated hidden weapon.

784
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,500
The body is still warm,

785
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:56,020
which means the killer was just here.

786
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,901
This is Know-it-all's unique weapon.
I've seen her use it.

787
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:00,940
It feels a bit dry
to the touch on the surface.

788
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:03,500
It must be from her sweat
when she clenched it

789
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,540
in her hand before she died.

790
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,500
It seems that the killer is
highly skilled and acts very quickly.

791
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:08,901
Before Know-it-all did anything,

792
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,701
she had already been poisoned to death.

793
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,500
The person who killed Know-it-all

794
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,661
is most likely the perpetrator
of the imperial cargo case.

795
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:28,500
What makes you say that?

796
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
This silver needle

797
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:33,181
is exactly the same as the one
used in the attack on Danqing.

798
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,540
Moreover, I've studied it.

799
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:38,221
This type of poison-coated silver needle
is custom-made

800
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,540
and requires a specially-made launcher.

801
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:45,301
And the subtle changes around the wound

802
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,460
match with those when Danqing

803
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,060
was attacked years ago.

804
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,020
So it seems Know-it-all
had discovered something

805
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,580
that could reveal
the identity of the murderer,

806
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:56,341
and that's why she got killed.

807
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,661
But the question is,

808
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,181
why was the murderer so well-informed

809
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:01,261
and why did they act so swiftly?

810
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,060
The only possibility is that the killer

811
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,460
is hiding in Liao City

812
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:07,701
and likely right among us.
