1
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:18,880
=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,568
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:24,386
You can tell from the poetry.

4
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:25,826
The spring breeze colors the clouds,

5
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:27,906
and the jade dew moistens the flowers,

6
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:30,945
therefore, it's best to brew
'Moonlit Encounter' on a spring day.

7
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:34,505
And the water used must be
from the dew on hundreds of flowers.

8
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:39,666
But the dew is rare to get for brewing.

9
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:41,345
It's not difficult.

10
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:43,266
Just immerse the flowers in water,

11
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:44,266
and through steaming,

12
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,626
the water containing the essence
of the flowers will turn into vapor.

13
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:50,345
Recondense this vapor back into water,

14
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,305
and you will obtain the purest
Jade Dew of a Hundred Flowers.

15
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:57,466
You're indeed skilled at brewing.

16
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:00,585
Well done.

17
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:02,026
Making wine with poetry,

18
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:06,345
it's akin to the ingenuity of Zhou You,
an artisan in the Southern Dynasty.

19
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:08,546
Did you say Zhou You?

20
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:11,625
Zhou You excels at creating
intricate trap blueprints.

21
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:14,346
He loves wine,

22
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:15,425
poetry, and painting.

23
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:21,106
It is said he would incorporate
the methods to unlock his traps

24
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:24,185
within his poetry and paintings.

25
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:26,465
Coincidentally,

26
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:30,465
I happen to have collected
many of Zhou You's paintings.

27
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,425
I'll show them to you.

28
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:33,705
Yeah.

29
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:48,066
- Let's open it and take a look.
- Okay.

30
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,546
This painting is extremely rare.

31
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:00,305
It's a treasured possession
that I have cherished for many years.

32
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,066
You can have it.

33
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:06,865
Consider it compensation for the brewing
recipe I obtained from you today.

34
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,546
Mr. Ouyang, are you saying

35
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:11,865
this painting is the clue
to the developing water?

36
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:17,865
I've heard that the sage founders
of our country

37
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:19,585
once obtained a treasure map.

38
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:22,986
Rumor has it that the traps

39
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:25,745
and the treasure map were
done by the same person.

40
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:32,425
So perhaps this painting contains
clues to the developing water.

41
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:33,666
I see.

42
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:35,745
Thank you, Mr. Ouyang.

43
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:38,546
I don't care about all that.

44
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,585
What I love are poetry, paintings,

45
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:44,305
chess, and wine.

46
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:45,905
You said

47
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:49,826
this wine was about the same
as Luo Ailian's 'Moonlit Encounter'.

48
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:54,106
You were not afraid I'd use this
as an excuse to not honor the bet,

49
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:56,865
and you've told me the brewing method.

50
00:03:57,066 --> 00:04:00,025
This is sufficient proof
of your pure intentions.

51
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:03,066
With this painting in your hands,

52
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:04,185
I am relieved.

53
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,826
We're glad to meet Mr. Ouyang
over chess and wine,

54
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:10,786
and we've had an unforgettable time.

55
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:13,346
Danqing and I won't
bother you any longer.

56
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,065
Remember to come and visit me often.

57
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:20,305
- I will bring fine wine next time.
- Good.

58
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:25,466
We will take our leave now.

59
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:35,026
Qingshan Clinic owes 4,000 dan.

60
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,586
Zishan.

61
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:42,786
Ying'er, what are you doing here?

62
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,945
I was just talking to Mr. Qin,

63
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:47,706
saying I wanted to give
Mr. Du some fine wine.

64
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:49,346
When are you going back?

65
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,226
You can take it.

66
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:55,305
You'll go home soon.

67
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,305
If you tell your father
about this good deal,

68
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,586
he will be very happy.

69
00:04:58,945 --> 00:04:59,986
You're thinking of us,

70
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:01,666
but what about Mr. Du?

71
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:03,745
If that's the case,
you should hurry back home

72
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:05,265
and make your father happy.

73
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:08,666
Ying'er, what's wrong?

74
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:11,986
Nothing. I'm okay.

75
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:12,945
I'll go now.

76
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,385
Thank you, Zishan.

77
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,786
(Zishan seems anxious for me to leave.)

78
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:36,265
(Is he afraid I'd discover something?)

79
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:40,265
(Why would Danqing have
the memorial tablets of the Luo family?)

80
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:42,666
(This is so strange.)

81
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:44,385
(The Luo family.)

82
00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:46,825
(The Luo...)

83
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:51,865
What?

84
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,185
Shen Danqing has
my dad's memorial tablet?

85
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,385
I saw it with my own eyes.

86
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:58,546
There's a secret door in Danqing's room,

87
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:00,505
with Luo Jida's memorial tablet in it.

88
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:04,346
Have you asked anyone else
from the Shen family?

89
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:05,825
Not yet.

90
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:06,945
Danqing is away,

91
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:09,945
and Zishan seems to be in a hurry
for me to leave.

92
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:11,346
Something felt off,

93
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:12,546
so I told no one.

94
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:15,026
Do you have any clues?

95
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:17,986
It is a bit strange.

96
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,986
Apart from Luo Jida's memorial tablet,

97
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:25,346
there was another one,

98
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:27,865
named Bin.

99
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,226
What?

100
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:31,346
- Bin?
- Yes

101
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:33,586
Bin?

102
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:36,945
Even if she is friends with Luo Ailian,

103
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,425
why would she honor Bin?

104
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,065
Who is this Bin?

105
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,625
Were there only these two

106
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:45,026
and not Luo Ailian's?

107
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,466
No.

108
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,546
Xue'er, what's going on?

109
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:58,265
If you know something, speak up quickly.

110
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:05,346
Ying'er, I have a bold guess.

111
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:09,146
Luo Ailian might still be alive.

112
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:14,065
What are you talking about?

113
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:15,986
Hear me out.

114
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:18,505
Bin is Luo Ailian's personal maid.

115
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:19,865
Since Luo Ailian died,

116
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:21,986
Bin has been missing.

117
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:27,346
Could the person who died
in the ancestral hall fire

118
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:28,986
wasn't Luo Ailian,

119
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:30,546
but Bin?

120
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:32,546
But if it was Bin who died,

121
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:36,106
where is Luo Ailian now?

122
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:42,906
Perhaps she is hiding
in the Shen family.

123
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,625
Otherwise, why would there
be a tablet for Bin

124
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,385
and not for Luo Ailian?

125
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:52,625
Stop your nonsense.

126
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,106
This is bizarre.

127
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:55,226
It might be,

128
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,385
but my instincts should be right.

129
00:07:58,425 --> 00:07:59,425
I was wondering earlier

130
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,625
how Shen Danqing could plan so precisely

131
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:04,505
and defeat the Luo family.

132
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:09,505
If that's the case, it makes sense.

133
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:14,106
Ying'er, have you ever heard

134
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,106
that the Shen family
has taken in a burn victim?

135
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:27,706
Did you say a burn victim?

136
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,146
I saw a tattoo of a lotus flower

137
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:32,625
on the back of Danqing's neck.

138
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,745
She said it was to cover a scar.

139
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,785
It seemed to be a burn scar.

140
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,466
You're saying Shen Danqing
has burn scars on her back?

141
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:42,706
Yes, Zishan said

142
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,466
Danqing was seriously ill before.

143
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,145
I asked the servants

144
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:48,426
and they said she was
bedridden for months.

145
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:51,306
Later, she suddenly
got better and recovered.

146
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:53,385
I didn't ask about the specifics.

147
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:56,905
I see.

148
00:08:58,785 --> 00:08:59,545
That explains it.

149
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,505
I've never heard of Luo Ailian
having connections with the Shen family.

150
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,665
Ying'er, you've known Shen Danqing
since you were young.

151
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:08,905
Has she ever mentioned
Luo Ailian to you?

152
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:11,826
Never.

153
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,186
I get it now.

154
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:20,385
The real Shen Danqing might have
passed away from an illness long ago,

155
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,706
and the one who appears before you now

156
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:24,745
is not your good friend
from the old days at all,

157
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:26,385
but Luo Ailian.

158
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:29,826
I hear you.

159
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,865
Danqing never knew
how to brew wine before,

160
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:36,586
but now she is very adept at it.

161
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:38,986
She says she can't remember many things

162
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,505
because of the serious illness.

163
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:45,106
Also, Zishan is deliberately
trying to drive me away.

164
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:48,106
Could it also be because of that?

165
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:53,545
Oh my, what on earth is going on?

166
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:58,106
This won't do.

167
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:02,145
Xue'er, I think we should
report to the authorities.

168
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:03,986
This scares me.

169
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:06,785
Ying'er, we can't do that yet.

170
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:08,226
We have no evidence.

171
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:10,545
Remember, from now on,

172
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:12,226
don't trust the Chen family again.

173
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:14,466
If you want the truth,

174
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:16,745
we must first verify our speculations.

175
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,785
(Zhou You's poem)
The poem explains the painting,

176
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:32,826
and vice versa.

177
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,466
This riddle should complement
this poem and painting.

178
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,905
So we must hurry to solve this riddle

179
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:44,025
and find the developing water
before Prince Yi returns.

180
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,745
Indeed, riddles are at hand.

181
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:52,186
However, the riddle I need to solve
is not just this one.

182
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:03,905
It's been a long time since we drank
and talked, hasn't it?

183
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:21,426
What's that look?

184
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:23,545
You haven't answered me.

185
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:27,106
Why can you brew the wine
that Luo Ailian is capable of brewing?

186
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:30,865
I...

187
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:32,865
But please don't tell me

188
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,306
it's because you can brew
Chengfeng Wine and Rose Liquor

189
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,346
and you just put two and two together.

190
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:40,385
Such words might deceive Mr. Ouyang,

191
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:42,306
but you can't fool me.

192
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:44,625
Shen Danqing.

193
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:48,826
How many more secrets
do you have that I'm unaware of?

194
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:08,665
Remember this?

195
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,466
I thought Mr. Ouyang and the Luo family
were old acquaintances

196
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:23,826
and this jade pendant
belonged to Miss Luo,

197
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:26,505
so I thought it better
to bring it along just in case.

198
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:30,106
I didn't expect that it
would indeed come in handy.

199
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:38,865
General Xu, what do you mean?

200
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:43,306
Luo Ailian entrusted me with this jade
pendant, which she treasured most,

201
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,025
and told me

202
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:47,025
she wanted to find out the truth.

203
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,905
After proving her innocence,
she'd come to me to take it back.

204
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:52,865
Otherwise, she'd rather it
be shattered to pieces.

205
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:58,145
Now, I return this jade pendant to you,

206
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,505
its rightful owner.

207
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:03,665
Okay, as I've said before,

208
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:06,706
I want to prove Luo Ailian's innocence.

209
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,226
I will keep it safe for her for now.

210
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:13,226
It's getting late.

211
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:14,745
We should go back.

212
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:21,946
Don't go.

213
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:23,586
Who are you, really?

214
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:26,426
Are you drunk?

215
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,426
Who else could I be,
if not Shen Danqing?

216
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:34,265
Stop lying and tell me the truth.

217
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:38,505
What are you doing? Let go!

218
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:57,145
I should have had doubts
about you long ago.

219
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,306
That day you took an arrow for me,

220
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,826
and I saw the scar on your neck.

221
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:03,306
Although it was covered
by a black lotus tattoo,

222
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,226
that scar was definitely
caused by a burn.

223
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,545
Don't open boxes when you shouldn't.

224
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:11,826
You want to see through me?

225
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,905
Before, when you saw the notice,

226
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,505
your expression suddenly changed.

227
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:20,106
Is it because, like that woman,
you've also switched identities?

228
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:22,905
You are not really Shen Danqing.

229
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:24,865
You are Luo Ailian.

230
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:29,025
You're asking questions

231
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:30,905
just to confirm I am Luo Ailian, right?

232
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:34,785
Are you afraid of meeting the same fate
as the Qinghe County Magistrate?

233
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,905
General, give me any punishment

234
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:39,625
you see fit.

235
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:47,665
You finally admit you are Luo Ailian.

236
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,265
I'm sorry. I'm late.

237
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:59,706
I should have realized sooner
that you were Luo Ailian.

238
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:04,186
How have you managed to keep it
a secret for such a long time?

239
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:06,426
You must have suffered a lot.

240
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,706
It must have been hard.

241
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:09,946
But from now on,

242
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:14,226
you don't need to pretend
in front of me.

243
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,106
You don't even ask me
if I have killed anyone.

244
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:27,265
Because I trust you.

245
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:32,785
Whether you are Shen Danqing
or Luo Ailian,

246
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:34,505
I trust you.

247
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:46,905
If you were able to confirm that I
am Luo Ailian through various clues,

248
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:49,346
others might as well.

249
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:54,466
General, you should stay away from me.

250
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,025
You can have better options.

251
00:15:58,226 --> 00:16:02,586
No, my choice has always been only you.

252
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:06,145
No matter what secrets you have,

253
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:07,745
I will keep them safe for you.

254
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,426
Danqing, actually, I've been thinking

255
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,426
if we could be together,

256
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:16,986
I could protect you more.

257
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:19,426
Nonsense.

258
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,306
No way.

259
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:23,826
I am still the murderer of my father

260
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:25,145
and I've stolen another's identity.

261
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:29,706
The road to revenge is not yet complete,
and the path ahead is certainly thorny.

262
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:31,226
But you're different.

263
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:34,826
You're a great general
with illustrious achievements.

264
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:35,466
You don't...

265
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:36,265
So what?

266
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:38,785
No matter what you want to do,

267
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:39,986
I can help you with it.

268
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:46,545
Actually, I've long harbored
deep feelings for you.

269
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,745
I forced you to reveal your identity

270
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:52,226
because I hope that
no matter what happens,

271
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:54,066
I can be your staunch shield.

272
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:56,545
No matter any clash of blades or swords,

273
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:58,145
as long as I am here,

274
00:16:58,745 --> 00:16:59,745
they can come at me.

275
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:05,825
♪Memories remember the past for me♪

276
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:06,426
Danqing.

277
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:08,825
You have your past and present lives.

278
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:10,426
And I have more than one side.

279
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:14,585
Don't you sometimes think
I'm frivolous and not serious?

280
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:20,545
But the less serious I seem,
the deeper my affections are.

281
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:23,250
♪One thought goes up

293

Come on.

294
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:34,906
You're back.

295
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:44,386
Zishan, we've found a clue
to the developing water.

296
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,186
Zishan, I apologize
for what I did earlier.

297
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:52,345
I was out of options.

298
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:56,146
What clue did you find?

299
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:57,666
A painting.

300
00:18:59,146 --> 00:18:59,785
Let's talk inside.

301
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:05,305
What happened between you?

302
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,226
I'll let you know later. Come on.

303
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,466
This painting is the clue
of the developing water

304
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:18,186
that we obtained from Mr. Ouyang.

305
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:20,946
We now know that
the treasure map and this painting

306
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,025
are both from the talented artisan
Zhou You of the Southern Dynasty.

307
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,146
The developing water is related to him.

308
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:29,666
The plum trees by the riverside ferry,

309
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,386
which means the painting
and the poem could potentially point

310
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:36,025
to the developing water's location.

311
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:41,025
That's right. Chengfeng has a list
of places with ancient books stored.

312
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:42,466
We can act separately

313
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,706
to gather Southern Dynasty ancient books

314
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,146
and see where Zhou You had been before.

315
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:50,186
Maybe there's any scenery that matches
the description in this painting.

316
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,265
Danqing is right.

317
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:56,585
We can also try to look for information

318
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,666
on what the developing water
is in the ancient books.

319
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,946
It's been a long time.

320
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:03,906
Even if the developing water is found,

321
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:05,785
it might be ineffective.

322
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:08,386
Well thought out, Zishan.

323
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:10,825
This time we must act quickly

324
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:12,105
and discreetly.

325
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,226
On the way to Mr. Ouyang,

326
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:16,866
we were followed.

327
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:18,906
It might be the people of Prince Yi.

328
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,426
Although he has been impeached,

329
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:23,025
he has not slackened in the slightest.

330
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:25,265
Let's split up tomorrow.

331
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:26,466
You just got back.

332
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:27,545
Get some good rest.

333
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:30,386
Oh, and by the way, go check on Ying'er.

334
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:31,466
She caught a cold

335
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,426
and has been in her room all day.

336
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:34,825
Then I'll go right now.

337
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:58,065
Zishan, why are you
staring at me like that?

338
00:20:59,186 --> 00:21:01,666
I can explain the incident
where I bound you last time.

339
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:10,505
Zishan, I know you're upset,

340
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,505
but was that necessary?

341
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:16,706
Do you think I hit you
simply because you tied me up?

342
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:18,866
If it weren't for your little tricks,

343
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:22,105
this trip of you and Danqing's
wouldn't be so smooth.

344
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:24,585
I am aware of her secret.

345
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:25,466
Aware?

346
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:27,025
What do you know?

347
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:30,505
Danqing's secret

348
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:32,666
and Luo Ailian's secret.

349
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:34,626
I am aware of them all.

350
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:36,345
I will keep her safe.

351
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:37,545
So what?

352
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:39,265
You know her secret,

353
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:41,785
but you know nothing about her past.

354
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:44,186
You enjoy her affection,

355
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:48,105
but you have never been with her
through the hardest days and nights.

356
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:51,585
I am the one who has stayed
with her through the long nights.

357
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:53,785
Why?

358
00:21:55,186 --> 00:21:57,345
Why does she like you, of all people?

359
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:58,186
Why?

360
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:06,466
Indeed, there are
many things in this world

361
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:10,146
where one can find fairness
between giving and receiving,

362
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:12,505
but not love.

363
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,305
Love knows no fairness.

364
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:18,426
I like her.

365
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:19,785
She likes me.

366
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:21,986
No reason is needed.

367
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:36,545
If you're still upset,
we can keep fighting.

368
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:38,745
But you have to promise me

369
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,466
that after the fight,
we are still good brothers.

370
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:13,545
Ying'er.

371
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:14,866
I'm back.

372
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:16,345
I heard you've caught a cold.

373
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:16,906
Are you alright?

374
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:18,866
I... I want to get some sleep.

375
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:22,065
Let's talk tomorrow.

376
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:25,226
Do you need Mr. Miao
to come and take a look?

377
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:26,146
No need.

378
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:27,505
You go back first.

379
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:29,626
Okay, then.

380
00:23:29,706 --> 00:23:30,585
Good night.

381
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:55,585
- Zishan.
- How is Ying'er?

382
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:57,986
She said she wasn't feeling well.

383
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,585
She wanted to rest and didn't see me.

384
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:05,105
- You can wait until she gets better.
- Mhm.

385
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:14,825
Zishan, there's something
I want to tell you.

386
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:20,065
What is it?

387
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:32,666
I...

388
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:38,466
You've come clean
to Xu Chengfeng, haven't you?

389
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:44,986
He guessed my identity.

390
00:24:45,545 --> 00:24:48,146
So, I couldn't hide it any longer.

391
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:51,466
He's more accepting of my identity
than I thought he would be.

392
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:53,706
And...

393
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:57,626
What else?

394
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:02,866
He said he wanted to marry me
once everything was over.

395
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:30,825
Did you say yes?

396
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:36,666
I know that marriage is a matter
of parental command.

397
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:40,025
And I've long considered you
as my own brother

398
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:41,825
and a father figure.

399
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:44,105
So I would like to ask
for your consent first.

400
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:47,825
I've also told Chengfeng

401
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:49,265
we'd have to wait

402
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,305
until Luo Ailian's name is cleared

403
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:52,745
before I can marry him.

404
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:06,025
Danqing.

405
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,706
Do whatever you want to do.

406
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,146
I will always support you.

407
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:20,426
Thank you, Zishan.

408
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,426
Miss, why are you suddenly
looking for this person?

409
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:43,065
Heaven helps me.

410
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:45,666
I have found a huge secret.

411
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:48,065
As long as we find her,

412
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:50,745
not only will it solve
our current predicament,

413
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,105
but it will also crush
Shen Danqing in one fell swoop.

414
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:55,545
Not just Ganlu Brewery,

415
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:59,345
I might even own Danqing Winery.

416
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:02,426
Shen Danqing.

417
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:07,265
Or perhaps I should call you Luo Ailian.

418
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:12,345
(Prince Yi's Mansion)

419
00:27:12,345 --> 00:27:14,386
It must have been a long trip
to Liao City from the capital,

420
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:15,545
Your Highness.

421
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:21,146
Xu Chengfeng thinks he can easily
bring me down with a mere impeachment.

422
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:22,545
How preposterous.

423
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:26,545
With just a few words, you have
resolved the crisis in the court

424
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:27,986
and regained the Emperor's trust.

425
00:27:29,226 --> 00:27:30,466
You have always been wise.

426
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:33,146
How could you fall
for Xu Chengfeng's tricks?

427
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:35,545
Xu Chengfeng provoked me repeatedly.

428
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:38,186
I shall not forgive him.

429
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:41,585
Has there been any unusual
activity during my absence?

430
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:48,226
Xu Chengfeng and Shen Danqing
ventured out in disguise,

431
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:51,065
seemingly looking for clues
to the developing water.

432
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:52,785
As you instructed,

433
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:54,105
the scouts followed them

434
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:56,386
but were discovered by Xu Chengfeng

435
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:57,386
and lost them.

436
00:27:58,065 --> 00:27:59,825
The outcome of their trip is unknown.

437
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:05,146
It appears that they already know
the secret of the developing water.

438
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:06,825
We must hurry.

439
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:09,265
Anything else?

440
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:10,906
One more thing.

441
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:12,785
According to the scouts left behind,

442
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:14,505
the Shen family has announced

443
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:17,065
that Shen Danqing is the adopted
daughter of Master Shen.

444
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,226
- Adopted daughter?
- Correct.

445
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:28,305
Shen Zishan, as the young master
of the Escort Agency,

446
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:31,105
did not accompany Xu Chengfeng
in search of the developing water

447
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:33,065
but let Shen Danqing go instead.

448
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:36,626
The relationship
between these three is intriguing.

449
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:39,025
I am quite curious.

450
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:43,386
Zong Wei, go investigate Shen Zishan.

451
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:46,105
- The more detailed, the better.
- Yes.

452
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:08,426
Danqing.

453
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:13,426
Why can't you look at me more?

454
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,305
Why did you choose him

455
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:35,065
but not me?

456
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:53,186
Find a way to have him stamp the bill

457
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:57,386
- and the blank sheet of paper under it.
- Right away.

458
00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:03,825
My apologies, Young Master Shen.

459
00:30:04,226 --> 00:30:06,986
Our establishment is closing, you see.

460
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:08,505
Young Master Shen.

461
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,666
The loose silver from the shop
has already been stored away.

462
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:13,745
There truly is no spare change for you.

463
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:16,505
Young Master Shen,
you are a regular patron of our shop.

464
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,226
(Zuiyun Tower)
Just a stamp on this bill is enough.

465
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,386
Your Highness is one step ahead,

466
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:36,946
noticing the abnormal
relationship between them

467
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:40,466
and took the opportunity
to spin a story on Shen Zishan.

468
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,105
Hearing your information

469
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:45,906
and looking at Shen Zishan

470
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:49,345
further confirmed my conjecture.

471
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:53,785
Shen Zishan is probably fond of
his sworn sister, Shen Danqing,

472
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:56,426
but Xu Chengfeng beat him to it.

473
00:30:57,745 --> 00:31:01,305
We can just use this to counterplot.

474
00:31:06,785 --> 00:31:10,146
Also, this plain note
with the Shen family's seal

475
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:12,986
is the boat ticket sending
Xu Chengfeng to his demise.

476
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:15,986
Once Xu Chengfeng falls,

477
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:20,986
the good days for Shen Danqing
and Shen Zishan will come to an end.

478
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:23,386
I want to watch with my own eyes

479
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:27,866
as they die one by one in front of me.

480
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,390
(General's Mansion)

481
00:31:41,545 --> 00:31:42,706
Your guards are here.

482
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:47,065
General Xu, an urgent secret decree.

483
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:50,025
His Majesty has heard

484
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:52,265
that you found important clues
to untangle the treasure map.

485
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:53,545
He is quite pleased.

486
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:56,986
But someone has impeached you
for neglecting your duty in Liao City

487
00:31:57,386 --> 00:31:58,265
and losing vital evidence.

488
00:31:59,146 --> 00:32:00,466
The Emperor fears future troubles

489
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:01,825
and orders you to find

490
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:04,946
important clues for the treasure map
case in ten days,

491
00:32:05,386 --> 00:32:07,505
or you must return to the capital
for investigation.

492
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,986
(The only evidence lost was a crossbow.)

493
00:32:10,906 --> 00:32:12,545
(When we traded the crossbow)

494
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,745
(for Zishan's medicine, only we,
Prince Yi, and Zong Wei knew about it.)

495
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:18,386
(Prince Yi won't expose
his shortcomings.)

496
00:32:19,386 --> 00:32:20,386
(What exactly is going on?)

497
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:24,706
I dare to ask if the impeachment
for losing evidence has solid proof.

498
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:28,065
Someone close to you
has submitted a statement

499
00:32:28,505 --> 00:32:29,505
and provided a deposition.

500
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:31,265
The Emperor was convinced after.

501
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:32,666
Someone close to me?

502
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:36,065
Could it be that there is
a traitor by my side?

503
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:52,065
Hold on, I have a gift
for Young Master Shen.

504
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:54,105
I am just a commoner.

505
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:56,025
Thank you for your kind intentions.

506
00:32:56,585 --> 00:32:57,866
I'd rather keep my distance.

507
00:32:58,466 --> 00:32:59,345
Why are you nervous?

508
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:01,825
You and Xu Chengfeng are love rivals.

509
00:33:02,265 --> 00:33:04,105
The enemy of an enemy is a friend.

510
00:33:04,426 --> 00:33:05,946
I will not harm you.

511
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:08,986
I will even give you the opportunity
to defeat Xu Chengfeng.

512
00:33:12,745 --> 00:33:16,146
Do you remember the bill you signed
at the Zuiyun Tower a few days ago?

513
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:20,626
In fact, you stamped your seal
on a blank paper.

514
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:24,345
On the plain note with your seal,
I've written your accusations

515
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:27,745
against Xu Chengfeng
and submitted them to His Majesty.

516
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:31,105
How could you, a dignified prince,
resort to such vulgar means?

517
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:33,186
By my calculation,

518
00:33:34,785 --> 00:33:37,226
the imperial secret decree
of condemnation should be arriving soon.

519
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:38,466
Listen to me.

520
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:40,946
You and I are now in the same boat.

521
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:43,906
From the moment Xu Chengfeng
receives the secret decree,

522
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,105
no matter what explanation you offer,

523
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:50,545
Xu Chengfeng and Shen Danqing will both
regard you as an outsider from now on.

524
00:33:53,025 --> 00:33:56,426
Rather than waiting
to be abandoned by them,

525
00:33:57,065 --> 00:33:58,305
it's better to take the initiative.

526
00:33:59,025 --> 00:34:01,065
I know you cherish
the glory of the Shen family.

527
00:34:01,785 --> 00:34:04,505
As long as you and I cooperate
to deal with Xu Chengfeng together,

528
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:08,145
I will make sure that you regain
the glory of the Shen family one day.

529
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:10,746
I won't do such a despicable thing

530
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:12,266
for selfish reasons.

531
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:14,225
Do not hurry to answer.

532
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:18,826
I will let you think it through.

533
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,386
Your Highness, save it.

534
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:23,185
I will never cooperate with you.

535
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,346
The Emperor has issued
you a military pledge.

536
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:36,906
It took a long time for
the treasure map case to yield a clue.

537
00:34:37,185 --> 00:34:38,426
Now, in just these ten short days,

538
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,386
how can any breakthrough
progress be guaranteed?

539
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,346
But an imperial edict is issued.

540
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:45,065
I can only do my best.

541
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:51,986
That's not right.

542
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:55,986
I remember you said that the Emperor
never listens and believes one-sidedly.

543
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:57,826
No matter how Prince Yi schemes,

544
00:34:58,466 --> 00:34:59,946
he would not act just for his status.

545
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:02,466
Why is he so irritated now?

546
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:11,625
They say there is a traitor
among those in the know.

547
00:35:13,585 --> 00:35:16,625
That's impossible.

548
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,906
From the beginning to the end,
only the three of us know the truth.

549
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:32,826
The traitor is me.

550
00:35:36,225 --> 00:35:37,585
Zishan, what are you talking about?

551
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:39,346
Prince Yi is cunning and sly.

552
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,145
I have fallen for his trap.

553
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,266
He used my seal

554
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:45,545
to forge a false testimony
and submitted it to the Emperor.

555
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:48,386
If I overturn it,

556
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:50,346
I would commit the crime of lying

557
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:52,386
which would not only endanger me

558
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,266
but the entire Shen family.

559
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,145
Zishan, we all believe in you.

560
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:11,266
There will absolutely be
no betrayal or suspicion among us.

561
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:15,505
Let's talk about solutions.

562
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:21,306
Chengfeng, if you have any
new investigative leads or instructions,

563
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:23,386
just give them to me.

564
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,466
I will do my best.

565
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:29,145
It will also count as my way
of making amends to you.

566
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:40,705
(Admiring High Mountains)

567
00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:42,346
Chengfeng, tell me.

568
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:44,585
Since the minister is in the court,

569
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:47,505
it's not difficult for you
to find out who impeached you.

570
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,946
Why didn't you tell Danqing just now?

571
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:57,266
I know you would never betray me.

572
00:36:57,906 --> 00:36:58,826
So, needless to say that.

573
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:03,225
Zishan, you wouldn't think
that I would stir up any trouble

574
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:04,906
in front of Danqing
because of it, right?

575
00:37:06,786 --> 00:37:09,025
Is that how you think of me?

576
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:10,786
I was discontented with you before.

577
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:12,585
And I hit you.

578
00:37:14,426 --> 00:37:16,306
It's only human for you to doubt me.

579
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:17,545
That's not related.

580
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,906
I've said it before.

581
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,426
Even after the fight,
we're still brothers.

582
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:24,986
I'm fair and clear.

583
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:26,625
You've saved me

584
00:37:26,946 --> 00:37:27,585
and bound me.

585
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:28,826
So we're even now.

586
00:37:29,866 --> 00:37:32,346
I will give my all for the treasure map.

587
00:37:34,306 --> 00:37:37,185
Great, let's find the map
and the developing water

588
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:38,386
as soon as possible.

589
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:39,746
Yeah.

590
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:58,266
If there's anything, just say it.

591
00:38:00,065 --> 00:38:01,426
I don't get it.

592
00:38:02,145 --> 00:38:03,946
You spoke so bluntly with Shen Zishan,

593
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,346
but why didn't he
fight with Xu Chengfeng?

594
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:10,625
You just can't change
your impatient nature.

595
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:12,225
I'm sorry.

596
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:13,866
You have a plan.

597
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,185
I overthought.

598
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:18,466
Those who should know already know.

599
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:20,545
And I have also found out some secrets.

600
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,705
Although Shen Zishan
has not come to us for now,

601
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:26,906
it doesn't mean he won't
turn his back on him in the future.

602
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,786
Just keep your eyes peeled

603
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:31,306
and wait for the show
between the three of them.

604
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:33,145
Yes, Your Highness.

605
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,665
Ying'er, are you feeling better?

606
00:38:47,065 --> 00:38:48,386
Are you still not awake?

607
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:52,705
I've brought you some tasty food.

608
00:38:54,346 --> 00:38:56,025
(Once you return, act normal.)

609
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:58,105
(Don't let Shen Danqing
notice anything.)

610
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:11,585
Danqing, you are so annoying,

611
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:13,025
disturbing one's sweet dreams.

612
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:16,585
What about now?

613
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:19,906
Still annoying.

614
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,065
It will make me fat.

615
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:23,426
A bit of chubbiness is cute.

616
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:29,306
I will accompany you
to the winery today.

617
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,346
I haven't seen wine-making before.

618
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:37,346
- I want to see it before I leave.
- Sure.

619
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,105
(Danqing Winery)

620
00:39:42,105 --> 00:39:42,625
Danqing.

621
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:44,906
It must be hard
managing the winery by yourself.

622
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:46,185
Not really.

623
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:49,786
- Miss.
- What's the matter?

624
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:52,346
The winemaker said there was
a problem with this yeast

625
00:39:52,665 --> 00:39:53,946
and would like your opinion.

626
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:02,746
This wine is clear
and free of impurities.

627
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,585
The floral aroma is strong,

628
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:08,986
overpowering the original
fragrance of the wine.

629
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:11,505
It's the rose flower.

630
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:15,266
Adjust the heat
when extracting the flower juice.

631
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,105
I will tell the winemaker.

632
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:21,505
Just by looking at the color

633
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:24,505
and smelling the wine, you were able
to find the problem.

634
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:28,306
I see others tasting the wine.
Don't you try it?

635
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:31,946
After checking the color and smell,
the next step is tasting.

636
00:40:32,426 --> 00:40:34,746
But I've found the issue by the smell,

637
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:35,826
so, no need to taste it.

638
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:38,946
Shouldn't you taste it
to be absolutely sure?

639
00:40:40,986 --> 00:40:42,585
You're right, Ying'er.

640
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:50,625
(You can observe her.)

641
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:53,665
(She has a habit when she tastes wine.)

642
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,585
It's undoubtedly an issue
with the flower juice.

643
00:41:08,225 --> 00:41:09,986
What's wrong, Ying'er?

644
00:41:11,306 --> 00:41:14,025
No, I'm just impressed.

645
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,306
I never knew you were
so good at winemaking.

646
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:21,466
Miss, General Xu is here.

647
00:41:21,986 --> 00:41:23,105
Mr. Shen said it was important

648
00:41:23,185 --> 00:41:24,145
and sent me here to get you.

649
00:41:25,386 --> 00:41:26,386
Ying'er, I...

650
00:41:26,386 --> 00:41:26,986
Don't worry.

651
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,306
When you have time, bring me
to see the winemaking process.

652
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:30,585
I'll stay back

653
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:31,505
and go home later.

654
00:41:31,946 --> 00:41:33,025
Okay, see you later.

655
00:41:33,426 --> 00:41:35,585
- Okay.
