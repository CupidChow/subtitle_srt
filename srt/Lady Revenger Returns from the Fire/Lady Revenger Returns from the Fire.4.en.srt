=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:21,660
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:25,424
What?

4
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:26,592
What?

5
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:28,311
Mother, what's going on here?

6
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,432
Calm down.

7
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:35,471
What happened?

8
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:36,792
I heard

9
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:38,712
only those who get wronged

10
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:40,872
will haunt everywhere.

11
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,632
Is it Mr. Luo

12
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:44,311
or Luo Ailian?

13
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:45,432
Nonsense.

14
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:47,152
Those who died can't cause any trouble.

15
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,391
Ghost.

16
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,872
Ghost.

17
00:01:54,952 --> 00:01:55,792
She's back.

18
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:56,872
She's haunting.

19
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,031
Calm down!

20
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:02,592
Master got frightened,

21
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:03,831
saying nonsense to scare the guests.

22
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:05,751
Let's get him down to rest.

23
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,391
Ghost.

24
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:07,592
Ghost.

25
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:13,072
Miss Shen.

26
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:15,312
I'm really sorry strange things

27
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,111
keep happening today.

28
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:17,991
I think

29
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:19,991
we should talk about business next time.

30
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,111
Alright.

31
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:30,000
(Luo Residence)

32
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,391
What a pity.

33
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,431
The goods are damaged.

34
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:38,151
I couldn't do the deal
even if I wanted to.

35
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:40,352
I will take my leave.

36
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:42,632
Since it can't be done,

37
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,792
please return the deposit, Miss Shen.

38
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:49,312
The contract has been signed,
and the deposit is non-refundable.

39
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:50,871
Funny.

40
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:52,871
The goods haven't
even left the Luo residence.

41
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:54,312
How dare you take the money!

42
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,512
Rules are rules,

43
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:57,472
but we can be flexible.

44
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,952
This deal was voided
before it even got started.

45
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:01,512
So it's not breaking the rules.

46
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:03,312
What do you think, Miss Shen?

47
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:04,591
Guards!

48
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:19,151
Strange things keep happening here.

49
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,472
And now you break the promise

50
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:22,591
and want to play

51
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:23,671
the bully.

52
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,352
You might be laughed at
if word gets out.

53
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,991
Who would know what happens

54
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:30,271
in the Luo's Residence?

55
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:36,391
What do you want to do?

56
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,391
Just the two of you,

57
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:41,032
do you think you can stop our guardians?

58
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,591
How do you know

59
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:45,352
it's just the two of us?

60
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:49,192
Even if all of your armed escorts

61
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:50,632
came to your rescue, so what?

62
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:52,591
Do you think we would be afraid?

63
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:54,111
Why don't you send someone

64
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:55,752
to the alley out there to find out?

65
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:03,632
Mother, don't waste our time.

66
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,072
Just go get the money.

67
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,312
You wretch! How dare you fool us!

68
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:10,312
Give the money back.

69
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:15,831
Who dares to move?

70
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:16,391
Nobody moves.

71
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:17,512
Mother, she hit me.

72
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:20,432
I'm really sorry.

73
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,192
I've learned the martial arts,

74
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:23,471
so it's just my natural reaction.

75
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,151
Madam, Miss Shuangshuang.

76
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,632
Those armed escorts

77
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,192
released some sort of fireworks

78
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,471
at the sight of us.

79
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:37,632
Don't know what it means.

80
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,151
To be honest,

81
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:42,151
General Xu Chengfeng
has entrusted us to escort valuables

82
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:44,231
and has provided us with a signal flare,

83
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:45,791
saying if there is any trouble,

84
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,231
we could summon him at any time.

85
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:50,591
Shen Danqing, how dare you

86
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,471
threaten us here!

87
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:53,271
I can report this to the official.

88
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:53,952
Go ahead.

89
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,271
But didn't you tell me?

90
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:59,351
Who would know what happens

91
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,271
in the Luo's Residence?

92
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,151
You!

93
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,752
Oh, if next time
there's such a good thing,

94
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:07,591
remember to notify me in advance.

95
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:12,471
Medical fee.

96
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:21,831
You!

97
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:24,151
Mother.

98
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:30,312
You just wait and see.

99
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:34,632
I didn't expect the Luo family
to try to bully us.

100
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,911
Miss, you are so smart.

101
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:37,952
It's really delighted.

102
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:39,672
At that time, you quietly told me

103
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,591
to buy some fireworks,

104
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:42,992
and said to light them up
once seeing the Luo's people.

105
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:46,112
I was so confused.

106
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:47,231
So you had

107
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,312
such a well-thought-out plan.

108
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:50,992
After you recovered from the illness,

109
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:51,952
you became more imposing.

110
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:54,512
Young Master.

111
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:05,911
Although they are not aware,

112
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:07,151
don't try to deceive me.

113
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:08,632
You went to Luo Residence

114
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:10,271
not for the business.

115
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:11,408
Right?

116
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,312
I stole the token

117
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:20,151
and made the fake command.

118
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,552
It is all my fault.

119
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:26,151
What exactly happened
at the Luo Residence today?

120
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:27,711
Tell me everything

121
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,711
in detail.

122
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:33,512
You're right.

123
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:35,072
I went there

124
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:36,632
not for the business.

125
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,312
I knew they wanted to ship out
distiller's yeast.

126
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:42,192
And this is the perfect time for me.

127
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:44,552
I had hidden phosphorus powder
in advance,

128
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:46,552
and sprinkled the powder out

129
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:49,231
to make the candles
in the ancestral hall explode

130
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:53,391
while offering incense to my father.

131
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:00,432
(Ms. Zhou,
Luo Shuangshuang and Luo Jizhou)

132
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,872
(were bound to be scared out of guilt.)

133
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:05,632
What's going on here?

134
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:06,711
Mr. Lin.

135
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:07,512
These are

136
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:08,952
part of the distiller's yeast.

137
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:10,192
There's more over there.

138
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:11,911
(Not only so.)

139
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,151
(I had Mr. Qin sprinkle
some lime into each jar)

140
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:17,072
(as he checked the distiller's yeast.)

141
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:19,231
Lime generates heat,

142
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:21,831
which can speed up the fermentation.

143
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:23,791
If it ferments too much,

144
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:26,151
it will produce
a red substance of spoilage.

145
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:28,151
If the fermentation is sufficient,

146
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:30,672
the heat generated will burst the jar.

147
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:32,791
Ms. Zhou and Luo Shuangshuang

148
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:34,192
don't know much about winemaking,

149
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:35,591
so they'd never figure out why.

150
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:39,031
And Luo Jizhou,
having done something evil,

151
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,591
couldn't remember anything in shock.

152
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:43,231
Do you know how dangerous this is?

153
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:44,831
You can get away with it

154
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,112
out of luck this time.

155
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:48,391
You might get caught next time.

156
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:50,711
Even if you don't get caught
by the Luo family,

157
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:52,471
they might target the Shen family.

158
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,312
But my face has completely changed,

159
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:55,728
and my voice changed slightly.

160
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:56,312
And...

161
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:57,231
Enough.

162
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:59,791
Why is your obsession so deep?

163
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:02,112
You broke into the Luo family

164
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:04,031
with Mr. Qin,

165
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:05,312
but how can you ensure

166
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:06,632
the two of you could get out of it?

167
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:08,791
You led the escorts
of the Shen Escort Agency

168
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:11,072
to fool the Luo family,

169
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,591
but how can you ensure

170
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:13,432
they won't

171
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:14,952
revenge us?

172
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:21,632
Exactly.

173
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:23,952
I admit.

174
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,831
I survive to revenge.

175
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,591
But please trust me.

176
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:33,312
I have prepared carefully.

177
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,471
Even if it costs my life,

178
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:39,591
I won't drag you

179
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:41,991
or the entire Shen family down.

180
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:52,336
♪Back and forth through
the heavy encirclement of fate♪

181
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:56,276
♪How many can return♪

182
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:59,072
What are you...

183
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,272
Nothing.

184
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:05,392
I came to tell you

185
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:07,511
Mr. Qin sent the ginseng

186
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:10,672
that Miss Shen bought to Master.

187
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,192
(So she heard it)

188
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:16,552
(and remembered it all?)

189
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:21,672
Miss.

190
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:28,192
Just now, Young Master
was a bit impulsive.

191
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,591
Please forgive him.

192
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:30,751
It's my fault.

193
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:32,471
I really did this

194
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,072
wrong.

195
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:35,672
I acted without telling him,

196
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:36,792
causing him to worry.

197
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:38,831
Let me tell you.

198
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,991
He really cares about
the safety of the Shen family.

199
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:45,351
Half a year ago, when Young Master
was escorting the imperial valuables,

200
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:47,231
he heard his sister got poisoned

201
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:48,991
and needed
a blood transfusion to survive.

202
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,471
He rushed back overnight to save her.

203
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,672
But when he returned at dawn,

204
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,032
he discovered

205
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,831
the imperial valuables got stolen.

206
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:00,312
Young Master felt ashamed.

207
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:03,272
From then on, restoring the honor
of Shen has been his mission.

208
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:06,912
He won't let anything happen
to the Shen family.

209
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:11,871
I see.

210
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:17,511
(Looks like the road
to revenge is tough.)

211
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,192
(I need to plan carefully.)

212
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:21,952
Sorry to let you suffer just now.

213
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,751
This can soothe you, so take it.

214
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,192
I am so useless.

215
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,511
Once I saw the room

216
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:35,432
full of blood-like distiller's yeast,

217
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:37,672
it reminded me of that night

218
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,152
when everything was ablaze as well.

219
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:43,152
Let bygones be bygones.

220
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,711
What should we do now?

221
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:50,272
The deposit Shen Danqing
tricked away isn't much,

222
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:52,392
but the ruined distiller's yeast

223
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,032
costs a lot.

224
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:56,871
If we can't brew
the birthday liquor for Mr. Li,

225
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,351
we will lose a large sum in penalties.

226
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:03,672
We need a batch of grain
to make the brewing

227
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:06,032
and sell it to make up
for the losses of the Ganlu Brewery.

228
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,952
The time and location
of this purchase must be confidential.

229
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:10,751
It's best if only you and I know.

230
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,152
For caution's sake,
you should go personally.

231
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:19,272
How much do you think today's events

232
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:21,912
have to do with Shen Danqing?

233
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:25,032
Why did so many troubles arise
once she came?

234
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:26,952
Does she know anything?

235
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,192
I've already sent someone
to investigate Shen Danqing.

236
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:31,711
She was a sick, undead woman.

237
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:34,231
I don't know what miracle drug
she's taken recently

238
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:35,111
to come back to life.

239
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:37,432
The Shen family has never
had any dealings with us.

240
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,672
And there's no way she knows
anything about our family.

241
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:46,751
Does she really have
a good relationship with General Xu?

242
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:48,991
If she said something to General Xu

243
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:50,552
and let him target us,

244
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:52,351
that would be a hassle.

245
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:54,192
She has absolutely no relationship
with General Xu.

246
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,711
The armed escorts just
let off the signal flare,

247
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:59,711
but the people of General's Mansion
did nothing.

248
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:02,952
She got some inside information

249
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:05,032
about the General's Mansion
from somewhere,

250
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:07,871
and tried to take advantage of us.

251
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:09,312
I will not let her off.

252
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,152
Take the medicine.

253
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:26,552
- Good.
- Great.

254
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,511
Amazing.

255
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:28,912
Even General Xu,
the so-called God of War,

256
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:29,952
is no match for you.

257
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:31,831
No.

258
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,072
Speaking of the demeanor and manner,

259
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:35,871
our second leader is better.

260
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,631
Big bro.

261
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,232
Thank you.

262
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:37,904
Big bro.

263
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:38,751
Goods are here.

264
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:39,856
Okay.

265
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,672
Let's go.

266
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,152
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

267
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:47,471
These past days,

268
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:50,152
we've scouted all the strongholds
around Liao City,

269
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:53,072
ruling out all female bandits' suspicion
who might hijack the imperial valuables,

270
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:54,111
except

271
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,631
the sister of this second leader.

272
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:56,991
She's the only

273
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:58,511
female bandit who never shows up.

274
00:12:58,952 --> 00:12:59,991
I'll ask him more about her.

275
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:04,272
If you follow my strategy,

276
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:05,991
you will surely unite

277
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:07,871
all the strongholds of Liao City

278
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:11,591
and be the king of the bandits.

279
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:12,831
Bro.

280
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:14,871
You really are my

281
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:16,351
think tank.

282
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:19,088
However,

283
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,952
why do you

284
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,392
help me?

285
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:31,231
What do you want?

286
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:37,312
Since that's the case,

287
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:39,312
then I'll just tell the truth.

288
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:40,152
Alright.

289
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,152
Having learned about your sister

290
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:44,672
hijacking the imperial valuables,

291
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,312
Tianhao, this guy,

292
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:47,591
admires her so much.

293
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:49,792
He wanted to be her husband.

294
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:53,432
I came to you

295
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:55,312
just to help him

296
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,111
pursue your sister.

297
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,672
Is that what you want?

298
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:00,792
What else?

299
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:03,552
I'm confused.

300
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:06,272
This female leader you mentioned
who hijacked the imperial valuables,

301
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:07,912
I've also heard of her.

302
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:09,471
But she isn't my sister.

303
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:10,991
Who else then?

304
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:13,032
I heard it all from your men

305
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:14,511
that your sister

306
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:15,792
lives a secluded life

307
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:17,192
and never shows up.

308
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,991
She's the heroine
who hijacked the imperial valuables.

309
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:20,991
Exactly.

310
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:26,792
What's wrong?

311
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:28,368
Sit down.

312
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:30,111
- Sit.
- Sit.

313
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,711
Bro, to tell you the truth.

314
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,672
My sister is lame,

315
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:42,152
so she hides herself away at home

316
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:42,991
and never shows up.

317
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,152
And the female leader you mentioned,

318
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:47,032
no one has seen her.

319
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:48,511
Rumor has it

320
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:51,392
that she's one of top three bandits.

321
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:55,032
I trust you.

322
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:55,672
Come on.

323
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,272
Come on.

324
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:56,784
Let's drink.

325
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:57,296
Come on.

326
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,032
Drink up.

327
00:14:58,831 --> 00:14:59,408
Drink.

328
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,792
The top three bandits are marauders
who act mysteriously,

329
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:05,351
with meticulous thoughts,

330
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:07,152
adept at covering her tracks,

331
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:09,991
and only interested in easy pickings.

332
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,392
Both places are extremely remote,

333
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:13,711
seldom frequented by bandits.

334
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,552
But according to the records,

335
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:17,831
cases related to the female bandits

336
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:19,952
were in precisely these two places.

337
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,072
Ordinary bandits usually
split the loot on the spot.

338
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:26,432
But this female bandit

339
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:27,591
is so cautious,

340
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:29,312
so their hiding place

341
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:31,351
must not be too close
to the crime scene.

342
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,312
Regarding the cases
about the female bandits,

343
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,312
all the victims mentioned one detail.

344
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:39,792
When this gang of bandits
commit their crimes,

345
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:41,392
they always bring plenty of horses,

346
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:42,751
water and food.

347
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:44,511
In other words,

348
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,871
the distance from the crime scene

349
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:46,591
to their hiding place

350
00:15:47,032 --> 00:15:48,032
is at least a day's journey.

351
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:50,471
Very good.

352
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:51,432
You've learned.

353
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:53,312
Point it out.

354
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:55,152
Where do you think they might hide?

355
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:02,471
Sha City.

356
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:05,912
Exactly.

357
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:07,248
Tianhao.

358
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:08,751
First, go to Sha City

359
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:10,751
to spread the news
that a caravan will pass by.

360
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:12,711
Then we'll disguise ourselves
as the caravan

361
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:14,231
and walk around there.

362
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,032
Let's lure them out.

363
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:17,591
I believe

364
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:18,871
these bandits

365
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:20,831
would take actions.

366
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:22,471
Got it.

367
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:29,952
(I must start with Luo Shuangshuang.)

368
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:31,152
(If something happens to her,)

369
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,312
(Ms. Zhou and Luo Jizhou
will be anxious.)

370
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,192
(Then the Luo family
will be in a chaos.)

371
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:36,672
(Baoyue House)
Thank you.

372
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,072
Miss Shen.

373
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:42,952
My shop has a new batch
of expensive perfume powder.

374
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:43,991
Would you like some?

375
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:45,912
I still have some perfume powder.

376
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:46,831
Miss Shen.

377
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:49,672
This perfume powder
was shipped from the West.

378
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:50,351
(Luo Shuangshuang?)

379
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:50,912
The cost is high.

380
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:53,231
(What a coincidence.)

381
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:54,511
We won't stock it anymore.

382
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:57,952
Okay, I'll take a look.

383
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,912
Alright, please come in.

384
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,072
Miss Shen.

385
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:05,152
Please have a look around.
I'll go get it for you.

386
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:09,311
Miss Shuangshuang, you are here too.

387
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:15,471
Miss Shen.

388
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:19,471
This is

389
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,592
the only one left.

390
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:26,751
The smell is really nice.

391
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:27,511
Yes.

392
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:29,392
A girl from the Escort Agency,

393
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:31,392
is always exposed
to the wind and the sun.

394
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:34,231
How could she deserve
such precious perfume powder?

395
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:36,071
What did you say?

396
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:38,471
Did I say anything wrong?

397
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,352
I'll take all of this perfume powder.

398
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:41,152
Wrap it up.

399
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:41,952
Well...

400
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:42,791
I'm taking it.

401
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,592
I'll pay double.

402
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:44,192
Triple.

403
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:45,031
Quintuple!

404
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,311
Alright, you got it.

405
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:48,912
Miss Luo.

406
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:49,832
I'll wrap it up for you.

407
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:50,448
Y-Y-You!

408
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:52,031
You did it on purpose!

409
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:53,392
What?

410
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:55,872
Buying something you love is priceless.

411
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,031
How could you say so?

412
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:58,031
You!

413
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:01,791
Miss.

414
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,352
You...

415
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:05,352
(Men's coats.)

416
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:07,551
You wretch!

417
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:10,352
That slap didn't hurt enough
last time, did it?

418
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:11,751
Want to try it again?

419
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:17,152
Scared?

420
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,311
Miss Shuangshuang,

421
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:20,791
Master told us

422
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:22,551
to hurry back once we're done here.

423
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:25,432
Stop there.

424
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:26,511
What?

425
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:27,824
Pay the bill.

426
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:29,152
You, pay it!

427
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:33,031
Sir, check please.

428
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:34,632
Alright, this way please.

429
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:38,031
According to this,

430
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:40,511
Luo Jizhou is definitely
going to buy more rice,

431
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:42,352
so he bought some coats.

432
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,711
He must be heading north.

433
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,392
According to the prepared food,

434
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,352
the only place

435
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:51,632
will be Lanling County

436
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:54,152
in Sha City.

437
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:56,632
Danqing.

438
00:18:58,551 --> 00:18:59,471
Brother, you are here.

439
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:04,912
Thank you.

440
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:07,471
After Father took the medicine
made with fresh ginseng,

441
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:08,832
he has now awakened.

442
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:10,992
That's good.

443
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,231
What were you looking at just now?

444
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:17,832
I...

445
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:24,912
You want me to trust you,

446
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:26,912
but you must trust me first.

447
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:29,471
I am now your elder brother.

448
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:35,152
I want to hijack the Luo's rice.

449
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,632
You still won't give up.

450
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:41,791
Exactly.

451
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:43,832
Distiller's yeast has ruined,

452
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:45,112
so they will definitely buy rice again

453
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:45,872
to brew.

454
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:47,632
I plan to hijack their rice

455
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:49,432
and cut off their way out

456
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,352
to put them in a difficult situation.

457
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:53,711
I already have a detailed plan.

458
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:54,832
There won't be any problems.

459
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:56,632
No matter how smart you are,

460
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:59,672
you can't guarantee
that the plan won't go wrong.

461
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:05,311
I heard about Danqing being poisoned

462
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:07,311
from Mr. Miao.

463
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:10,352
Now I am one of the Shen family.

464
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:12,271
I understand
the Shen family's situation.

465
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,311
And I will never do anything
that implicates the Shen family.

466
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,392
Nothing is foolproof.

467
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:21,872
I'm sorry.

468
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:23,672
I still can't

469
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:25,311
risk the Shen family's safety.

470
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:27,711
Brother.

471
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,112
You'd never know

472
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,192
until it is done.

473
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,592
Why can't you just trust me once?

474
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:35,511
Just once.

475
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:40,231
(Seeing her being so determined,)

476
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,031
(if I still try to stop her,)

477
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:43,632
(I'm afraid she might take a risk.)

478
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:46,471
(I can say yes now,)

479
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:48,791
(and then she'd tell me the plan,)

480
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,672
(so I can control the situation.)

481
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:52,656
Okay.

482
00:20:53,112 --> 00:20:53,952
I agree.

483
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:55,672
But just once.

484
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,096
Okay.

485
00:20:58,471 --> 00:20:59,311
Deal.

486
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,152
Brother, look.

487
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,471
They've prepared coats now,

488
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:08,551
so they should be heading north.

489
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:11,031
Then it's only
Lanling County in Sha City.

490
00:21:16,432 --> 00:21:18,352
Keep up.
We must arrive before it's dark.

491
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,352
- Yes.
- Yes.

492
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:25,672
Miss, they are here.

493
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:26,952
What to do next?

494
00:21:33,471 --> 00:21:34,912
Cut them off in the middle of the team.

495
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:38,392
One group takes the carts
in front and heads east,

496
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:41,311
and another group takes the carts
in the back and heads west.

497
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:47,231
Remember, no killing.

498
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,352
Just hijack the grain.

499
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,192
Meet south of the city after two hours.

500
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,392
Then we'll ship the grain

501
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:55,152
into the city in batches in disguise.

502
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:00,208
Go.

503
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,112
- Yes.
- Yes.

504
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,152
Master, road hijack!

505
00:22:10,152 --> 00:22:11,592
Protect the grain.

506
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,592
Oh no. Someone beat us to it.

507
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:26,872
Isn't there a rich caravan

508
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:27,672
passing here today?

509
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:29,271
Why is it a grain convoy?

510
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:30,952
Don't act rashly.

511
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:31,912
Just wait.

512
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,432
Is everything ready?

513
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,352
It's all hidden in the boxes.

514
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:37,672
Tell them all

515
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:39,152
to put on a play.

516
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,311
Don't reveal any flaws.

517
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:41,991
Yes.

518
00:22:44,872 --> 00:22:45,432
General.

519
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,471
A group of bandits is hijacking ahead.

520
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:49,192
The leader is a woman.

521
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:51,112
Looks like our plan worked.

522
00:22:51,952 --> 00:22:52,872
I'm afraid not.

523
00:22:53,192 --> 00:22:54,711
Lead the team to keep up.

524
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:56,311
I'll go check first.

525
00:22:58,471 --> 00:22:59,120
Giddy-up.

526
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,352
Bros, keep up.

527
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:01,632
- Yes.
- Yes.

528
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:05,432
Hurry to protect my grain.

529
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,352
Master has fled.

530
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:22,432
Everyone, run!

531
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:23,271
Hurry!

532
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:32,991
Indeed some sluggards.

533
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:34,231
Never achieved anything.

534
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:36,551
As planned, you retreat first.

535
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:38,096
- Yes.
- Yes.

536
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:49,471
Judging from the outfit,

537
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:50,872
he must be the one we want.

538
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:53,031
(General Xu?)

539
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:54,511
(I have to lure him away.)

540
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:56,112
(Or the armed escorts can't retreat.)

541
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:57,112
Giddy-up.

542
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,912
No. Although this man
is dressed as a merchant,

543
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:04,711
he's quite agile.

544
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,991
Is it a trap set
by the official soldiers?

545
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:08,392
We can't stay here. Retreat!

546
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:21,808
Giddy-up.

547
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:08,656
Giddy-up.

548
00:25:24,511 --> 00:25:26,112
General, looks like the female bandit

549
00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:27,231
has headed north.

550
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,511
She's injured and can't go far.

551
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:34,112
To the north is the Shen Escort Agency.

552
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:39,184
(Shen Residence)

553
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:55,991
Danqing.

554
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:57,912
Come in.

555
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,551
You got injured?

556
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:09,551
My arm's injured.

557
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:11,192
Everything goes smooth at first,

558
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:14,551
but General Xu suddenly intervened.

559
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:16,271
So I lured him away.

560
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:18,112
Mr. Qin should have already

561
00:26:18,112 --> 00:26:19,912
transported the food to a safe place.

562
00:26:20,672 --> 00:26:21,832
General Xu?

563
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,511
Xu Chengfeng?

564
00:26:24,112 --> 00:26:25,071
Did he discover you?

565
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:26,392
He didn't see my face.

566
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:29,152
He probably didn't follow.

567
00:26:31,031 --> 00:26:31,791
Forget it.

568
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:33,551
He's not that easy to handle.

569
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:38,231
Let's have Mr. Miao
check your wound first.

570
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:40,751
Young Master.

571
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:42,872
General Xu Chengfeng is here.

572
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:44,832
He is waiting for you in the front hall.

573
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:18,432
General Xu.

574
00:27:20,912 --> 00:27:22,192
General Xu,

575
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:23,551
what an honor to see you.

576
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:29,632
Zishan.

577
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:32,152
Long time no see.

578
00:27:32,432 --> 00:27:33,872
General Xu, well...

579
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,392
Come on.

580
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:37,791
Don't be that polite.

581
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:39,832
Call me Chengfeng.

582
00:27:40,432 --> 00:27:42,872
We were just kids back then.

583
00:27:43,352 --> 00:27:45,632
And now you are a famous general.

584
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:47,231
I should respect you.

585
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:49,392
Don't be that polite.

586
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,311
But from now on,

587
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:53,231
we will meet a lot.

588
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:55,551
I'm here to inspect Liao City affairs,

589
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,632
so I will stay for a while.

590
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,471
Zishan, to be honest,

591
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,471
I came to your house

592
00:28:02,152 --> 00:28:03,031
for a female bandit.

593
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:04,551
Female bandit?

594
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:06,392
However, this female bandit
is bold and cunning.

595
00:28:06,711 --> 00:28:08,511
She jumped into a river

596
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:09,751
to get away.

597
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,711
Your house

598
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:15,112
is the only place
near where she can swim to.

599
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:16,832
I now suspect

600
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:18,231
that the female bandit

601
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:19,471
is hiding at your house.

602
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:23,392
How could that be possible?

603
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:26,471
Then why not call out all the females

604
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,912
to see if anyone

605
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:29,711
has wet clothes or hair?

606
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,471
There are only
a few females in my house.

607
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
I would certainly not harbor bandits.

608
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:34,152
General Xu.

609
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:36,912
Don't you trust me?

610
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:40,271
Zishan, I don't meant that.

611
00:28:40,672 --> 00:28:42,551
I believe you would not harbor bandits.

612
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:44,192
But I'm also afraid

613
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,071
someone's hiding in your house,

614
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:47,832
and you don't know.

615
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:49,832
Enough.

616
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,271
You can tell when you call them all out.

617
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:56,432
Okay, I'm on it.

618
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:11,832
General, no one's hair is wet

619
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:13,711
and no one has a similar physique.

620
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:21,071
General, you can trust me now, right?

621
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,912
Let's go to Zuiyun Tower.

622
00:29:26,152 --> 00:29:28,791
Zishan, I remember you have a sister.

623
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,511
The one in the painting, right?

624
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:36,392
Why haven't I seen her?

625
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,192
She has just recovered

626
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:39,071
and isn't a swimmer.

627
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:40,632
It can't be her.

628
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,791
General, there's no need
to check on her.

629
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:44,311
Since it can't be her,

630
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:45,711
why not go check on her?

631
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:48,112
I can be relieved after it.

632
00:29:48,432 --> 00:29:50,471
And you can prove
your sister's innocence.

633
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:52,392
The best of both worlds, right?

634
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:57,592
What do you think?

635
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:03,471
I've been asking someone
to get some hot water for me,

636
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:04,311
but no one...

637
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:05,791
Danqing, you...

638
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,152
Why is everyone here?

639
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:12,352
This is...

640
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,392
I'm Xu Chengfeng.

641
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,791
Xu Chengfeng.

642
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:27,471
That name

643
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:29,071
sounds quite nice.

644
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:31,152
I am Shen Danqing.

645
00:30:31,711 --> 00:30:32,551
Don't be rude.

646
00:30:32,592 --> 00:30:33,912
This is General Xu Chengfeng.

647
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:35,832
Don't come out dressed like this.

648
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:36,592
Go back.

649
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:38,231
Why can't I be dressed like this?

650
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:40,311
Am I supposed to dress up at home?

651
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,152
Besides, I didn't know there are guests.

652
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:43,536
General.

653
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:46,711
Miss Shen's hair
is still dripping water.

654
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:49,991
Sharp eyesight.

655
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:54,471
I was taking a bath and calling
for someone to get hot water.

656
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:56,952
No one responded, so they are all here.

657
00:30:59,352 --> 00:31:00,751
Why are you

658
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,952
still staring at me?

659
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:10,071
Miss Shen, I'm running out of tea.

660
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:12,311
Please get me some water.

661
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:18,791
There are so many maids here.

662
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:21,511
Aren't they enough to serve you?

663
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:25,071
I'll do it.

664
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:27,352
No way.

665
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:29,632
Miss Shen has to do it.

666
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:33,711
Miss Shen.

667
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,071
Is that okay?

668
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:41,392
Sure.

669
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:44,112
So overwhelming!

670
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:05,352
(Her arm isn't injured.)

671
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:07,352
(Maybe she's not the one.)

672
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:12,352
Tea, General.

673
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,071
