=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,536
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,244
(Luo Jida's Spirit Tablet)

4
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:29,765
Father.

5
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:32,405
Bin.

6
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:35,524
I'm back.

7
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:39,084
I'm finally in charge of the Luo family.

8
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:42,524
I'm not so far

9
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:46,284
from completing my vengeance.

10
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:48,364
I must punish the evil

11
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:49,965
while upholding the good.

12
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:53,644
I will make Luo Xue'er pay the price

13
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:55,965
and plead guilty

14
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:58,084
to clear Luo Ailian's name.

15
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:02,045
I will make our family's

16
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:03,804
wine business prosper.

17
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:06,120
(Luo Jida's Spirit Tablet)

18
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,605
As for Shuangshuang,

19
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,205
I am her elder sister.

20
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:17,165
I will set her life on the right track

21
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:19,285
and live up to your expectations.

22
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:21,844
Miss.

23
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,765
Miss, Young Master
has prepared a celebration feast.

24
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:28,045
Let's hurry back.

25
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:31,445
How is Luo Shuangshuang doing
at the suburban estate?

26
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,485
She has been taken care of
as you instructed.

27
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:34,445
And no one confines her.

28
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:36,485
But she ran away on her own.

29
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:37,564
What?

30
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,325
She must not trust us.

31
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,524
She doesn't know
how to survive out there.

32
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,165
I should bring her back.

33
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,205
I promised Ms. Zhou

34
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:48,445
to treat her kindly.

35
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,165
I can't break my promise.

36
00:02:50,844 --> 00:02:51,445
Besides,

37
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:53,364
you investigate the Xiao Winery

38
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:55,124
in the neighboring county
about 20 years ago.

39
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:57,084
I want to know everything
about this winery,

40
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:59,205
and all the details
of the Xiao family's downfall.

41
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:00,325
And also the connection

42
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,184
between the Xiao family and Luo Xue'er.

43
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:03,684
Furthermore, you investigate

44
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,885
the Luo family's arranged ghost marriage
with the Du family.

45
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:08,445
These two matters must
be investigated covertly.

46
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:09,765
I need more details.

47
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:11,124
Yes, Miss.

48
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:15,364
I am Luo Shuangshuang.

49
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:17,644
As long as you can save my mother,

50
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:19,124
this gold hairpin will be yours.

51
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:22,644
That's all?

52
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:24,524
This is all I have now.

53
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,605
But my mother has money.

54
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:28,404
As long as you can let me see her,

55
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:29,964
she will find a way to get the money.

56
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:32,165
Ms. Zhou is a major criminal.

57
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:35,325
This gold hairpin is not enough.

58
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:37,165
You need to give me extra 50 taels.

59
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:38,804
Then I will let you in.

60
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,325
50 taels?

61
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:42,605
But...

62
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:45,844
But this is all I have now.

63
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,885
I am almost out of money for food.

64
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:52,285
Where can I get 50 taels?

65
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,485
You better hurry up and find a way.

66
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,124
If your mother gets executed,

67
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,885
it will be too late for regrets.

68
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:04,844
Mother.

69
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:08,925
Shen Danqing has
taken over our suburban estate.

70
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:11,325
She has no good intentions.

71
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:15,205
I have nowhere to go now.

72
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,285
What should I do?

73
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:25,244
Today is not only the day

74
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:27,285
Danqing took over the Ganlu Brewery.

75
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,165
It is also her birthday.

76
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:31,165
Two happy things.

77
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,525
I'd like to propose a toast to her
on behalf of everyone here.

78
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:36,485
Congratulations
on getting what you wanted.

79
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:38,845
I hope everything goes well
for you in the future.

80
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:42,564
Thank you. I hope you're always happy.

81
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:49,244
Come on.

82
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:51,004
- Miss.
- Raise your cups.

83
00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:52,324
Give a toast to her.

84
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:53,564
Let's do it.

85
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:58,564
- May Miss Shen stay young and happy.
- May Miss Shen stay young and happy.

86
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:00,045
Thanks.

87
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:29,485
Today is Danqing's birthday.

88
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:32,244
You miss her, don't you?

89
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,645
If you have anything
to say to your sister,

90
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:41,645
just tell me.

91
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:49,525
Alright.

92
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:53,605
Danqing.

93
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,004
Today is your birthday.

94
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,285
I miss you very much.

95
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:01,485
I promise you

96
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:05,364
that I will take revenge
on the murderer who killed you.

97
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:06,925
If I can't do it,

98
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:10,045
let me bear the torment
of a burning inside me

99
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:12,124
and suffer a sharp pain.

100
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:14,124
How could you say that?

101
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,324
If Danqing knew you are unhappy,

102
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,204
she would certainly be regretful

103
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:21,605
and not rest in peace.

104
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:25,845
You are not her.

105
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,405
You don't understand.

106
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:30,405
Yeah.

107
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:32,324
I am not her.

108
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,324
But I care about you just as she did.

109
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:38,244
Seeing the person
you care about in deep pain,

110
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:40,485
I would rather suffer in his place.

111
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,444
I wish you happy.

112
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:46,564
That is not just my wish.

113
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,405
It's also a wish
made on behalf of your sister.

114
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:51,605
You told me

115
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,485
that I could be myself

116
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,004
with you by my side.

117
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:58,244
I also hope

118
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:00,204
that your life can be carefree.

119
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:05,645
Okay.

120
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:07,925
Vengeance must be taken.

121
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:09,684
I also want to live without worry.

122
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:12,684
For Danqing.

123
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:14,124
And for you too.

124
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,965
I'll take care of you for your sister

125
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:21,564
and make you always wear a smile
when you're with me.

126
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:24,165
Young Master.

127
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:26,004
Young Master.

128
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:27,324
Found it.

129
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:29,564
For the poison
on the Know-it-all's hidden weapon,

130
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:31,244
the antidote is the Xinggancao Herb.

131
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:33,285
This herb is precious and rare.

132
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:35,804
Not many stores in Liao City sell it.

133
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:37,764
Okay, tell the armed escorts

134
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:39,845
to find out who has bought it
from yesterday till now.

135
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:41,204
Send a message to Xu Chengfeng.

136
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:42,925
We'll meet him later
in General's Mansion.

137
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:43,684
Okay.

138
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:47,725
The murderer who poisoned Danqing

139
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,165
is about to be exposed.

140
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:51,485
Let's talk about the details on the way.

141
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:53,165
Okay.

142
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:56,040
(General's Mansion)

143
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,405
The poison
Know-it-all was afflicted with

144
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:00,845
is indeed the Blood Night Bloomer.

145
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:02,965
So the person who killed Know-it-all

146
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:05,124
must also be the one
who hijacked the cargo

147
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:06,324
and poisoned Danqing.

148
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:07,764
And this person

149
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:10,405
is hidden among those
who bought the Xinggancao Herb.

150
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,925
So we can only wait for the list

151
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:15,124
from the investigation of Mr. Miao
and the armed escorts.

152
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:16,725
That way we can pinpoint the murderer.

153
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:18,124
General.

154
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,004
It's the list of those
who bought the herb.

155
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,925
Among them, a man surnamed Xiao
is the most suspicious.

156
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:28,525
I guess Mr. Miao and others have

157
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,124
found the buyers for Xinggancao Herb.

158
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,840
(List of buyers for Xinggancao Herb)

159
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:40,084
Xiao Wei? How could it be him?

160
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,125
He works for Zong Wei.

161
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:46,804
Could it be

162
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:48,365
that he is the murderer?

163
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:49,765
With his ability,

164
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:51,405
he couldn't kill Know-it-all.

165
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:54,844
Xiao Wei?

166
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:56,564
Zong Wei?

167
00:08:57,324 --> 00:08:58,165
Prince Yi.

168
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,165
So it all makes sense.

169
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:02,125
He bought the antidote for Zong Wei.

170
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:04,604
Based on the person who could
use both Dissolving Powder

171
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:06,165
and the Blood Night Bloomer,

172
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,604
Know-it-all found
that Zong Wei was the murderer.

173
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:10,684
Before she told us,

174
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,125
Zong Wei killed her.

175
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,324
And Zong Wei was injured as a result.

176
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:15,964
So he sent his man to buy the antidote.

177
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,525
I didn't expect

178
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,684
that the murderer
who poisoned my sister was Zong Wei.

179
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:24,724
He can't get away with it.

180
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:26,964
Although Zong Wei did it,

181
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,045
the mastermind
behind this must be Prince Yi.

182
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:33,444
At that time, apart from His Majesty,
Prince Yi and some ministers knew

183
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:36,405
that the Shen Escort Agency
was transporting goods.

184
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,645
Without the support of Prince Yi,

185
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,165
Zong Wei couldn't have received the news
in advance.

186
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,525
Nor could he have planned it
so flawlessly.

187
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,324
I thought that Prince Yi came here

188
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:48,925
because he personally opposed me.

189
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:50,645
Unexpectedly,

190
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:51,765
he was the mastermind,

191
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:53,245
and tried to destroy the evidence

192
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,604
to hide the fact that he murdered
and stole the treasure map.

193
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:57,084
So we learn

194
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,165
that Prince Yi sent Zong Wei

195
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,484
to poison my sister, lure me away,

196
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:02,324
and secretly steal the treasure map.

197
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:05,165
Then he spread false information
to the bandits to ambush

198
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:06,525
and confuse people.

199
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:07,925
Exactly.

200
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,444
The female bandit got the information
and went to plunder the cargo,

201
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,444
only to find that the box was empty
when she returned to her place.

202
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:17,324
They did not know that this was a ruse
by Prince Yi and Zong Wei.

203
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:19,604
Instead, they thought
your family had stolen the goods.

204
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,484
Kill two birds with one stone.

205
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:23,564
The two of them

206
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,484
are so vicious.

207
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,885
So the priority is

208
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:30,084
that we need to find a way
to lure Zong Wei out.

209
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,045
If he fires the poisoned silver needles,

210
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,484
he needs a special launcher.

211
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,964
Let's catch him red-handed.

212
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:44,125
But Know-it-all is already dead.

213
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:44,964
We have no proof.

214
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:46,724
It's not easy to lure him out.

215
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:00,925
Your Highness.

216
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:04,925
How are your injuries?

217
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,005
Thanks for your concern.

218
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,444
I have found the antidote

219
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:08,365
and felt better.

220
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:10,484
It was my fault.

221
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,804
I underestimated Know-it-all

222
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,045
and fell for her trap.

223
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:14,125
You discovered

224
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:16,645
that Shen Zishan had contact
with Know-it-all

225
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,405
and killed her promptly,

226
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:19,365
Otherwise,

227
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:21,684
she would've handed over the evidence
and clues she found

228
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,525
to Xu Chengfeng and the others.

229
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,885
You didn't handle this neatly enough,

230
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:27,484
but you did your job well.

231
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:39,964
After you stole the treasure map,

232
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,525
I deliberately lured the female bandits
to plunder the cargo

233
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,645
and let them take the fall.

234
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,245
Up to now, I've been uninvolved.

235
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:50,084
So, before decoding the treasure map,

236
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:52,405
do not make mistakes again.

237
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:53,885
Yes, Your Highness.

238
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:11,365
Zishan, I have a method we can try.

239
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:18,765
Lv Zhu?

240
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:23,885
Actually, Zong Wei doesn't know

241
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:26,925
that every time Lv Zhu sends messages
through a homing pigeon,

242
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,684
I have intercepted and read them.

243
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,084
You mean

244
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:31,684
we use false information
to lure him out?

245
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:32,525
Exactly.

246
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:35,724
I can write to Zong Wei
in Lv Zhu's words

247
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,204
to tell him
that Know-it-all left a letter

248
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:39,045
behind the Shan Hall's plaque.

249
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:41,804
A letter containing evidence pointing
to Zong Wei and his associates.

250
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:45,005
Then we'll set up a trap for him.

251
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:48,045
We're sure to catch him.

252
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,245
Miss Lv Zhu, are you looking for me?

253
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:00,925
General Tianhao,
I saw your gauntlet was damaged,

254
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:02,285
so I sewed it up for you.

255
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:03,525
Try it on.

256
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:08,324
Well...

257
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:10,245
This is...

258
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:12,245
When I was a child,
I hated to wear clothes with patches.

259
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:14,765
My family was poor and had no money
for making new clothes.

260
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:16,925
So my mother would

261
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:17,885
make the patches look nice.

262
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:19,045
So I would like wearing them.

263
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:20,645
You're good with your hands.

264
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:22,925
I can only sew a patch on them.

265
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,005
General Tianhao.

266
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:26,564
We will have plenty of time.

267
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:28,084
I will teach you later.

268
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:29,165
Okay.

269
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:32,285
Wait a second.

270
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:33,324
Two stitches to go.

271
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:35,005
I will do the rest.

272
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,844
(The letter mentioned by Lv Zhu?)

273
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:07,285
(Know-it-all left the evidence
before her death?)

274
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:10,204
(Terrible.
If this isn't totally resolved,)

275
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,964
(the issue of stolen treasure map
will cause a stir.)

276
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:17,992
(Half a year ago)

277
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,324
Young Master!

278
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:37,444
Young Master,
something terrible happened.

279
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,804
Miss Shen is poisoned at home.

280
00:14:38,804 --> 00:14:39,844
Her life is uncertain.

281
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:40,564
What?

282
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:41,724
How could it happen?

283
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,684
Mr. Lin, you go on

284
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:44,645
and transport the cargo.

285
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,324
After I make sure Danqing is safe,

286
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:48,005
I will try to catch up with you.

287
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:48,964
But remember.

288
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:50,285
Do not open that box.

289
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,604
The client doesn't let others
know what is inside.

290
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:53,285
Got it?

291
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:53,964
Yes.

292
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:55,604
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

293
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,084
Giddy up.

294
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,765
His Highness's plan was perfect.

295
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,245
I can't let anyone find anything
because of my negligence.

296
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:56,285
Xiao Wei!

297
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:01,405
Find two skilled men.

298
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:02,885
There's something important to do.

299
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:04,125
Yes.

300
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,645
Zong Wei, it really is you.

301
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,444
You poisoned my sister.

302
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:44,964
Be careful!

303
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:50,044
I will snatch the crossbow.

304
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,645
It's engraved with your surname
and family crest.

305
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,284
If I find that the poison on the silver
needle is Blood Night Bloomer,

306
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,684
it will be conclusive evidence.

307
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:13,125
Neither you nor Prince Yi can escape.

308
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:26,565
- Zishan.
- Zishan.

309
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:27,805
Zishan.

310
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:31,444
Zishan.

311
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,565
Zishan.

312
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:36,845
Zishan.

313
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:40,204
Zishan.

314
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:18,684
Mr. Miao, how is my brother?

315
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:23,204
I have exhausted all my medical skills.

316
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,645
But I can only make him live one day.

317
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:27,165
One day?

318
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,244
Only one day?

319
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,684
The poison he suffers is the same
as Danqing's.

320
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:37,365
Fortunately, I just used silver needles
to seal his major acupoints

321
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:38,845
to prevent the poisoned blood
from harming him.

322
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:40,405
I used calming incense
to sustain his life.

323
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,684
He can live until dawn.

324
00:20:43,405 --> 00:20:45,204
If he fails to take the antidote
before dawn,

325
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:46,524
I'm afraid

326
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:48,845
he has little chance of survival.

327
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:50,444
What if he has my blood?

328
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:52,244
When Danqing was poisoned,

329
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:53,365
Zishan gave her his blood,

330
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:54,845
prolonging her life by half a year.

331
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:57,724
You can't.

332
00:20:58,244 --> 00:20:59,125
Don't forget

333
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:02,605
you two aren't related by blood.

334
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:08,004
I'll go and see
if the medicine is ready.

335
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,204
(When did he arrive?)

336
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,165
General Xu.

337
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:37,204
Danqing, you and Zishan...

338
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:39,204
That's alright.

339
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:40,684
Miss.

340
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:42,444
Since General Xu has already heard,

341
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:45,085
why not just tell him the truth?

342
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:49,524
General Xu, to be honest,

343
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:52,044
Miss Shen was adopted

344
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,165
by Master Shen.

345
00:21:58,365 --> 00:21:59,764
It's not an important secret.

346
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:01,165
My father was afraid
I would be mistreated,

347
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:03,085
so he didn't make it public.

348
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,165
I was impertinent.

349
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,204
I failed to catch up with Zong Wei.

350
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,204
So I thought of hurrying back

351
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,284
to discuss countermeasures.

352
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:13,805
But unexpectedly,

353
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:15,845
I overheard your conversation
with Mr. Miao.

354
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:18,125
That's alright.
After all, you're my friend.

355
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:19,684
We are just trying to find a way

356
00:22:20,284 --> 00:22:21,365
to find the antidote for Zishan.

357
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,845
Zishan has less than a day to live.

358
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:24,805
Less than a day?

359
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,325
How was Danqing treated
when she was poisoned back then?

360
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:32,244
Young Master found the Dragon Grass

361
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:33,764
to remove Danqing's poison.

362
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:36,645
But we can

363
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:39,365
hardly find the Dragon Grass

364
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,645
I'll think of another solution.

365
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:51,204
Danqing, don't worry.

366
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:54,004
Lv Zhu works for Prince Yi.

367
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:56,365
I've already sent Tianhao
to keep a close eye on her.

368
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:57,645
We go to see her.

369
00:22:57,885 --> 00:22:59,204
We might be able to get some clues.

370
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:01,244
Okay.

371
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:26,085
Why did you betray His Highness?

372
00:23:26,444 --> 00:23:29,244
No, I didn't.

373
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:31,325
You delivered fake news to trap me.

374
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:33,484
If I didn't wound Shen Zishan today,

375
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:34,605
I would have been captured.

376
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:35,565
You didn't betray us?

377
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:37,724
No, I didn't.

378
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:44,044
Lv Zhu!

379
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:55,724
Lv Zhu.

380
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,365
Lv Zhu, hang in there.

381
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:01,444
Somebody!

382
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:07,605
Zong Wei did this?

383
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:08,605
Yes.

384
00:24:09,484 --> 00:24:10,405
I'll help stop the bleeding.

385
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:12,204
Hang on.

386
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,365
No need.

387
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:15,405
The knife was poisoned.

388
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:17,365
I won't survive.

389
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:21,125
Sorry, I'm late.

390
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:24,444
General Tianhao.

391
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:26,244
Don't blame yourself.

392
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,565
I know that Mr. Shen has been poisoned.

393
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:32,964
Prince Yi has a pharmacy on Xisi Street.

394
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,684
It's specifically for Zong Wei
to make poisons and medicines.

395
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:38,125
You can go there to find the antidote.

396
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,004
Go quickly.

397
00:24:41,204 --> 00:24:41,925
Go ahead.

398
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:43,964
Tianhao, take good care of her.

399
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:44,684
Let's go.

400
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:51,405
Lv Zhu.

401
00:24:51,764 --> 00:24:53,004
General Tianhao.

402
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:56,764
From now on,

403
00:24:57,805 --> 00:24:59,484
no one will bother you anymore.

404
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:07,044
I've worked for Prince Yi
for five years,

405
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:10,724
living every day
like walking on thin ice.

406
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:14,684
Just staying alive

407
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:17,284
is already hard enough for me.

408
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:19,524
Now,

409
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:23,325
I'm finally free.

410
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,845
You did it all
to keep your mother alive and safe.

411
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:29,964
So you didn't dare to defy Prince Yi.

412
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:32,764
You are kind,

413
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:34,605
and unwilling to harm us.

414
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,004
It has been tough for you.

415
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,605
In the past,

416
00:25:46,165 --> 00:25:47,885
I had plenty of time.

417
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:49,885
But,

418
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:53,165
everything is impermanent after all.

419
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:55,125
I know

420
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:58,684
that I'll never see my mother again.

421
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:02,764
General Tianhao.

422
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:05,964
Take care.

423
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:13,044

00:26:26,645 --> 00:26:29,405
You hope to regain freedom one day.

427
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:35,805
Now,

428
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:39,484
you are free.

429
00:26:41,204 --> 00:26:42,365
You're free now.

Which one is the antidote?

434
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:18,605
Prince Yi rented this place

435
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:19,805
just to let Zong Wei

436
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,204
make poisons and antidotes here.

437
00:27:22,085 --> 00:27:24,684
There should be some special markings
on these cabinets.

438
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:26,805
Let's search separately.

439
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:28,165
Okay.

00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:00,444
Danqing.

441
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:03,365
I have a clue here.

442
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:09,645
Other cabinets all have labels.

443
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:11,044
Only this cabinet

444
00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:12,325
has special markings.

445
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:14,524
It means the poison
or antidote is inside.

446
00:28:34,684 --> 00:28:35,444
I guessed right.

447
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:42,524
It's the same as the one
that injured Zishan.

448
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,244
The one turning black is poisonous.

449
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,365
The one without change

450
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:47,845
is the antidote.

451
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:49,244
Exactly.

452
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:54,964
Be careful.

453
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:03,925
Are you okay?

454
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:05,204
I'm fine.

455
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:11,724
It's all my fault.

456
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:12,845
I was too careless.

457
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:14,244
It's not your fault.

458
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:16,405
Prince Yi and Zong Wei are cunning.

459
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:21,044
You are injured.

460
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:23,244
A minor cut. It's not serious.

461
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:24,605
I'll stop the bleeding for you.

462
00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:38,684

00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:41,244

on the battlefield.

468
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:03,244
I'm going to apply hemostatic powder.
It will sting a bit. Bear with it.

489
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,645
I feared Lv Zhu would
reveal the secret of the antidote.

00:31:48,244 --> 00:31:49,405
Before reporting to Your Highness,

491
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:51,405
I just killed her.

493
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,524

00:32:05,405 --> 00:32:06,524
Please punish me.

495
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:11,365
How long have you been with me?

496
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:12,724
Since I was little,

497
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:14,284
I have been working for you.

18 years?

00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:22,724
You are the longest-serving person
by my side.

501
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:25,524
I can say that you know me very well.

502
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:26,805
So,

503
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:28,845
you should know

504
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:31,885
that I never keep useless servants
by my side.

505
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:35,605
Your Highness.

506
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:37,925
It was you

507
00:32:38,444 --> 00:32:39,365
who saved my life.

508
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,405
My parents were abandoned
by their respective sects.

509
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:44,885
When I was child, my family
was retaliated against by the sects.

510
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,724
Eventually, my family was destroyed.

511
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:50,204
Only I survived but became homeless.

512
00:32:50,964 --> 00:32:52,764
You were the one who saved me
and brought me back.

513
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:54,365
You gave me food and clothing,

514
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,764
taught me martial arts,

515
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:57,645
and allowed me to study

516
00:32:58,044 --> 00:32:59,004
and learn the etiquette.

517
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,805
My life is yours.

518
00:33:01,764 --> 00:33:03,365
You can take it at any time.

519
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,165
I'm sad

520
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,805
that I can no longer serve you.

521
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:14,565
Hold on.

522
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:18,845
Give me the knife.

523
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,044
If you take my life personally,

524
00:33:24,484 --> 00:33:25,645
it will be my honor.

525
00:33:40,405 --> 00:33:43,365
I indeed don't keep useless servants
by my side.

526
00:33:44,244 --> 00:33:45,524
But to me,

527
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:47,484
you are not a servant.

528
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:53,484
I am strict with you

529
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,805
because I have high expectations of you.

530
00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:05,284
I'll keep you alive

531
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:08,124
for the moment.

532
00:34:09,285 --> 00:34:09,845
In the future,

533
00:34:10,205 --> 00:34:11,604
exchange new achievements for your life.

534
00:34:12,524 --> 00:34:14,124
I hope you do not disappoint me again.

535
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:16,725
Thank you for your grace.

536
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:18,325
I really appreciate it.

537
00:34:19,004 --> 00:34:21,444
I will devote myself to serving you.

538
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:22,885
Get up.

539
00:34:25,885 --> 00:34:27,805
Your Highness, the crossbow is evidence.

540
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:29,964
I will go to find Xu Chengfeng.

541
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,205
No need to rush.

542
00:34:33,444 --> 00:34:35,524
They will come to me

543
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:37,325
with the crossbow

544
00:34:37,964 --> 00:34:38,885
and all the evidence.

545
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:41,644
Your Highness.

546
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:43,725
General Xu and Miss Shen are here.

547
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:45,964
Let them wait in the front hall.

548
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,124
Yes.

549
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:53,325
You know

550
00:34:53,765 --> 00:34:55,484
why we're here.

551
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,564
So let's put everything on the table

552
00:34:58,964 --> 00:34:59,964
and make a deal.

553
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,205
Your Highness.

554
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:05,524
You're the mastermind
behind the treasure map case.

555
00:35:06,644 --> 00:35:08,044
You poisoned Danqing

556
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:10,885
to force Zishan
to leave the escort team.

557
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:13,484
Then your man stole the treasure map
from the box

558
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,484
and lured bandits to plunder the cargo
to confuse people.

559
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:17,805
Now,

560
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:20,524
you pretend to investigate the case
to play detective.

561
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:22,205
Well played, Your Highness.

562
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:24,205
You made a good plan.

563
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,285
This crossbow is the evidence.

564
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:34,044
I can exchange this evidence

565
00:35:34,805 --> 00:35:35,925
for the antidote

566
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:37,084
to save Zishan's life.

567
00:35:39,644 --> 00:35:41,124
You're wrong, General Xu.

568
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,925
I also came here

569
00:35:43,164 --> 00:35:45,325
to do things for His Majesty.

570
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:47,084
Now that you've asked me for help,

571
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:48,885
I should generously offer assistance.

572
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:51,964
But the antidote is incredibly precious.

573
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:55,444
You want to use this
in exchange for the antidote.

574
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,004
It's far from enough.

575
00:35:58,484 --> 00:35:59,365
What do you want?

576
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:02,405
What do I want?

577
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:07,245
It seems you two are
in no position to bargain right now.

578
00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:09,564
I want

579
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:11,604
to have what I want.

580
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:15,885
I want you

581
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:18,325
to hand over all the information

582
00:36:18,765 --> 00:36:19,725
about the treasure map.

583
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:21,444
After all,

584
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:23,725
you no longer need it.

585
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:26,444
Alright, as you wish.

586
00:36:27,164 --> 00:36:28,044
Up until now,

587
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:30,484
all the information related
to the treasure map is kept

588
00:36:32,004 --> 00:36:33,405
in a locked cabinet

589
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:34,845
in my study.

590
00:36:54,205 --> 00:36:55,845
Your Highness, here it is.

591
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:57,644
What we wanted isn't here.

592
00:37:03,444 --> 00:37:04,564
After all this time,

593
00:37:05,044 --> 00:37:06,124
this is all you have found?

594
00:37:07,484 --> 00:37:08,604
It seems

595
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:10,325
I overestimated you.

596
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:13,644
You hold a high position and power.

597
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:15,725
You covet the treasure map

598
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:17,805
because you try
to monopolize the iron mine

599
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:19,564
to expand your power.

600
00:37:20,124 --> 00:37:21,524
His Majesty is benevolent.

601
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:23,245
Why must you do this?

602
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:24,885
The deep bond between brothers

603
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:27,405
can't compare with money and power.

604
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,245
I won't usurp the throne

605
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:32,685
unless I must.

606
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:35,845
I can't let him control me.

607
00:37:37,044 --> 00:37:38,205
You've done whatever you can,

608
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:40,845
but I fear you will destroy yourself.

609
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:43,484
You should worry about yourself first.

610
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:46,685
After all, you have no evidence now,

611
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:47,925
right?

612
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:54,044
The antidote.

613
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:12,004
I hope you can learn a lesson

614
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:13,725
from this incident.

615
00:38:14,564 --> 00:38:16,685
You will never outfight me.

616
00:38:21,484 --> 00:38:22,604
I won't forget

617
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:24,964
what you have done.

618
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:26,964
Let's go.

619
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:15,765
Danqing.

620
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:18,564
Chengfeng.

621
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:21,205
Mr. Miao.

622
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:23,205
Zishan, do you feel better?

623
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:24,644
Can you move your limbs?

624
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:42,205
Look, I'm fine.

625
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:44,245
Don't worry about me.

626
00:39:45,044 --> 00:39:47,444
Hurry and bring the murderer to justice.

627
00:39:52,164 --> 00:39:54,205
Zishan, what happened?

628
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:55,685
Why did your hands become so cold?

629
00:39:56,245 --> 00:39:56,845
Mr. Miao.

630
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:58,245
Well...

631
00:39:58,765 --> 00:39:59,845
Miss, don't panic.

632
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:11,805
Is there a problem with this antidote?

633
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,405
The antidote is real.

634
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:16,524
But we got only half of it.

635
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:18,765
It barely keeps him alive.

636
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:21,164
But he can't move normally.

637
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:24,164
If he fails to take the other half
of the antidote within a day,

638
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:26,524
he will be in bed

639
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:29,004
for the rest of his life.

640
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,124
Danqing.

641
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:34,285
Miss Shen.

642
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,285
Mr. Miao, take good care of Zishan.

643
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:37,405
