=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,920
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,435
Tea, General.

4
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:36,075
Thank you.

5
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:42,596
Danqing.

6
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:43,116
How dare you!

7
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,396
I'm sorry. The tea was too hot.

8
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:50,435
I didn't grip it firmly.
It was an accident. Are you alright?

9
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:54,155
Yes, it's okay.

10
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:57,316
Thank heavens.

11
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:03,476
But it is also a warning to you.

12
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:05,875
Don't boss people around.

13
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:11,316
Having a woman you just met serve
you tea may cause you injury.

14
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:13,316
How dare you say that to the general?

15
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:14,996
I'm telling the truth.

16
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:18,795
Your name sounds like that
of a dashing young man.

17
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:25,876
But who would have thought
you turned out to be flippant?

18
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:27,355
Danqing, stop it.

19
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:35,115
I was rude just now.
Miss Shen, I hope you can forgive me.

20
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:38,476
Not that serious.

21
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:42,196
But please leave
after finishing this cup of tea.

22
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:47,316
After all, this small place
is not big enough for you.

23
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:54,115
Thanks for your advice, Miss Shen.

24
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:59,955
But I have a feeling
that we will meet again.

25
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:04,555
I hope to leave
a good impression on you next time.

26
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:21,716
Zishan, please stay.

27
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:24,996
General Xu, my sister
didn't know any better.

28
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,916
She's too young. I'm sorry for that.

29
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,196
If you treat me as a general,
your sister just committed disobedience.

30
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,555
But if you call me Chengfeng,

31
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:36,635
your sister was
just joking with me earlier.

32
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:41,515
Alright, Chengfeng.

33
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:44,756
That's right.

34
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:53,036
Didn't you say that you
and Mr. Shen were old acquaintances?

35
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:54,355
Why do you seem so estranged?

36
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:58,276
Zishan and I spent years
studying together,

37
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:00,075
but that was in our youth.

38
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:03,515
Do you really believe
it wasn't an inside job?

39
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:06,596
Zishan is gentle, generous
and very righteous.

40
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:10,115
I've said before he would not
bring shame to his own family.

41
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:14,635
He may not, but that girl might.

42
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:17,036
She took the opportunity
to splash water on you.

43
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:19,315
And what are the odds?

44
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,956
They were robbed by a female bandit
leaving traces back to them.

45
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:27,875
In my opinion,
Shen Danqing must be involved.

46
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:32,115
I don't know much about Zishan's sister.

47
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,795
But I won't forget my duty.

48
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:36,995
Since I've been tasked
with investigating this matter,

49
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:39,995
I will surely do it impartially.

50
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:42,716
Tianhao, have people
watch the Shen family closely,

51
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:45,235
especially Miss Shen.

52
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,476
Inform me immediately
of any unusual activity.

53
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,276
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:53,956
Bear with it.
I'm going to set your bone.

55
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,476
All done. Nothing serious.

56
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:02,795
I'll go get
the bone-setting ointment for you.

57
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,636
Many thanks, Mr. Miao.

58
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:13,315
Xu Chengfeng is meticulous
and hard to convince.

59
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:16,076
Think about it. Are there any holes?

60
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,036
I'm not sure.

61
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:26,076
It's already lucky
to have been let off by him today.

62
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,716
For safety's sake,
put off your revenge for now.

63
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,836
You're his target now.
He won't give up easily.

64
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:37,555
I do have a way to divert his attention.

65
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:40,036
What way?

66
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:45,396
Please help me spread the word.

67
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:49,956
(Prosperity)
General, you're going to the yamen.

68
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:51,355
It's about time to go.

69
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:53,156
How are things in the Shen Mansion?

70
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:55,476
Nothing unusual since we left.

71
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:56,956
Miss Shen hasn't even left the house.

72
00:05:57,555 --> 00:05:59,675
Really? Keep a close watch.

73
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:03,276
General, there's trouble!
Go take a look at the front gate.

74
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:09,036
Tianhao, why is it such a strong scent?

75
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:12,115
Come.

76
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:13,916
What's going on?

77
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,875
I don't know.

78
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:20,315
Why are there so many women?
Can we even get out?

79
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,115
We must get out. Come.

80
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:24,716
The general is enamored
with the scent of a woman,

81
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:26,195
especially the Western Regions type?

82
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:30,476
Are you sure the word
got out from the General's Mansion?

83
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:32,516
That's what everyone is saying outside.

84
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:35,036
I hear quite a few women
have already gone to his mansion

85
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:36,036
to get a head start.

86
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:38,476
The Western Regions type.

87
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:43,916
The last box of this scented powder
from the Western Regions.

88
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,636
Go prepare a carriage.
I'm going to his mansion.

89
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:52,755
Yes.

90
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,755
Not bad, young man.
Quite handsome, aren't you?

91
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:03,315
You can't compare to me,

92
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:06,195
but you're adequate
to deceive those ladies at the entrance.

93
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:09,115
In a moment, you'll walk out
to lead them away.

94
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:10,716
But we don't look alike.

95
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:13,716
Stop jabbering
and put this on. Act tough.

96
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,836
You're tougher than me. This won't do.

97
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,156
How can you know without trying?

98
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:18,675
I'm scared.

99
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:21,675
Quit dawdling. Let's go.
You'll walk out like this in a moment.

100
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,036
- General.
- I'll be right behind you.

101
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,115
- General Xu.
- General Xu.

102
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:28,875
General Xu, we have been waiting
for you for a long time.

103
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:41,235
Be careful.

104
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:56,315
(This scent.)

105
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:02,435
Make way. Let me have a look.

106
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:05,156
Make way.

107
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:05,916
Everyone, stop.

108
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,355
General Xu.

109
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:13,836
- General Xu.
- General Xu.

110
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:15,435
What's the matter?

111
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:20,516
This scent is very familiar.
Someone has applied special powder.

112
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:22,836
Each of these women has applied powder.

113
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:25,076
Are you planning
to find the woman by her scent?

114
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:26,755
General Xu.

115
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:31,875
Miss Shuangshuang, what a coincidence.

116
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,396
General, you still remember me?

117
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:39,596
I would like to invite you
to my residence for a chat.

118
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,116
What do you say?

119
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:43,116
Of course, my pleasure.

120
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:45,356
Please.

121
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:49,675
- Shuixian, wait here.
- No shoving.

122
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:55,756
Make way. Didn't you hear
the general invited me to his mansion?

123
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:59,756
Get out of my way and go back.

124
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,116
No point in waiting here.

125
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:12,916
Is there something on my face?

126
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:16,835
Why are you staring straight at me?

127
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:18,876
You're making me shy.

128
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,036
I'm curious about you.

129
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:28,516
What are you doing, General?

130
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:31,396
The scent on you is very unique.

131
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:36,156
Perhaps that's because the powder
I applied is one of a kind.

132
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:39,876
Is the powder exclusive to you?

133
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,715
(It seems the rumors are true.)

134
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,156
(He has finally taken a fancy to me.)

135
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:45,955
(How can I let him go to others?)

136
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:52,276
Of course. I made it personally
to match my own temperament.

137
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:56,715
I specially added the Dai flowers
from the Western Regions.

138
00:09:56,715 --> 00:10:00,555
There's only this one in the city.

139
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:08,795
Are you telling the truth?

140
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:13,516
Of course. Are you doubting me?

141
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:15,595
I am not.

142
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:21,315
I'm just so eager to find the person
who matches this scent.

143
00:10:22,715 --> 00:10:24,716
You've only met me a few times,

144
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:26,928
and you're already so obsessed with me?

145
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,156
Since this scent belongs only to you,

146
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:33,756
you are the one I am looking for.

147
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,636
General, if you intend to propose
marriage, please choose a date soon.

148
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:42,675
I'll be waiting at home for you.

149
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:51,116
I'm afraid you can't return home today.

150
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:54,756
General, I was raised in a strict home.

151
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:58,835
No matter how eager you are,
the formal betrothal process is a must.

152
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:02,516
Guards, Luo Shuangshuang has colluded
with bandits to plunder food.

153
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:06,396
Take this disorderly woman into custody.

154
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:13,315
A proposal? Arrest, I'd say. Let's go.

155
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,075
(General's Mansion)
(General, I'm wronged.)

156
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:23,356
How could I possibly conspire
with bandits to steal food? I'm so rich.

157
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:24,636
I just heard you liked

158
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:27,036
the fragrance of Western Regions
on a woman,

159
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:29,156
so I applied the powder,
trying to lure you.

160
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,876
Must a woman who dresses
to please her love be put into prison?

161
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:33,475
Stop pretending to be innocent.

162
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,756
I advise you to confess early
to avoid physical torment.

163
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:39,236
Tell the guards
to keep a close eye on her.

164
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:40,715
Yes.

165
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:44,555
General, I'm innocent.

166
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:50,675
Sir, I am the maid of Miss Shuangshuang.

167
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:54,555
General Xu invited her to his mansion,
and it has been several hours.

168
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:56,876
May I ask when she'll come out?

169
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:59,236
Luo Shuangshuang colluded
with bandits to seize food.

170
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:00,675
She has already been imprisoned.

171
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:05,835
You did it, right?

172
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:14,075
Why would Xu Chengfeng believe
she is a bandit and arrest her?

173
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:17,356
When I was being chased by General Xu,

174
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:20,555
I threw a handful
of scented powder at him to escape.

175
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,075
The powder has a distinctive scent.

176
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,075
And there's little of it.

177
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:27,675
The last box just so happened
to be bought by her.

178
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,955
So you spread the word that he liked

179
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:33,916
the scent of the Western Regions type
to set up Luo Shuangshuang

180
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,636
and divert his attention.

181
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,916
That was just a temporary solution.

182
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,396
How could Luo Shuangshuang be so foolish
as to rob her own family's food?

183
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,435
General Xu will soon figure it out.

184
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:46,555
So what are your plans next?

185
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:50,516
I will find the right time
to convince him of my innocence.

186
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:54,236
But before that, I'll let
Luo Shuangshuang suffer for a while

187
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:59,236
as payback for falsely
accusing me of killing my father.

188
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,955
Now she's going to taste
the bitterness of being wronged.

189
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:09,356
(Pawnshop)
Please take care.

190
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:11,876
The Luos' carriage.

191
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:18,675
You can go back. I'll go check it out.

192
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:21,516
(Pawnshop)

193
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:24,955
What good stuff do you have?

194
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:26,220
Miss Shen.

195
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,156
I've kept all the good stuff for you.

196
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:32,396
Wait. I just saw
the Luo family's carriage leave.

197
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,356
What were they pawning off?

198
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,475
Here. Just some trinkets.

199
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:39,636
Please wait a moment. I'll go get you
some interesting and rare items.

200
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,116
(It's Xuepian fabric.)

201
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:52,236
(That's right. This is
what Luo Shuangshuang was wearing)

202
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:53,876
(when she wanted
to kill me in the fire.)

203
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:58,435
(The torn spots match, and there is
a hole in the right shoulder.)

204
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:01,236
(But Luo Shuangshuang
cares about her looks.)

205
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:04,516
(Even if a piece of clothing
comes unsewn, she'd just throw it away.)

206
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:07,876
(Why is there a patch on it?)

207
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:14,276
(And why does the stitching
look so familiar?)

208
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,332
(Owner, Luo Xue'er)

209
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,036
(Luo Xue'er.)

210
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:32,435
(How could it be you?)

211
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:39,340
(Prison)

212
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:12,236
Stop!

213
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:13,315
Stay away!

214
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:16,396
Who are you?

215
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:21,795
I have something to ask you.
If you want to live, tell me the truth.

216
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,715
Okay.

217
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,996
Half a year ago, you bought
all the Xuepian fabric in a cloth shop

218
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:29,356
and made a set of clothes. Is it true?

219
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:34,075
Half a year. Y-Y-Yes.

220
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:36,276
Is it true
that you've been wearing them?

221
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,075
After the clothes were made,

222
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:42,075
I tried them on and thought
they looked ugly, so I gave them away.

223
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:42,715
To whom?

224
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:47,236
Why would I know? Who are you exactly?

225
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:52,675
What is this? What are you doing?

226
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,356
These poisonous bees
are from the Western Regions.

227
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:57,916
After being stung by them,
your body will swell and fester.

228
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,756
And you will be left with ugly scars
for life. Are you going to tell me?

229
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:04,195
Please. Let me think.

230
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:09,195
It was Xue'er. Yes.
I gave it to my sister Xue'er.

231
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:10,795
You're lying. It can't be her.

232
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:15,116
It seems you want to try it?
Are you gonna tell me or not?

233
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:16,555
I am not lying.

234
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:20,435
I'm telling the truth, I swear.

235
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:23,636
My mother gave all the clothes
I didn't want to Xue'er.

236
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:30,075
What about Luo Jida?
Was it you who killed him?

237
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:33,396
It was not me.
It was that wench Luo Ailian.

238
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:35,795
I didn't do anything. Get it away.

239
00:16:43,996 --> 00:16:46,955
(If not you, who else could it be?)

240
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:51,795
(That person was burned
on the shoulder.)

241
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:54,715
(Why is her shoulder unscathed?)

242
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:59,715

killed by her most trusted sister.

I was such a fool.

(Luo Ailian's Memorial Tablet)
I've come to see you.

289
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:29,035
I didn't want to harm you,
but I had no choice.

290
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:34,475
I'm not the same as you.
I am not our father's biological child.

291

You probably didn't know about this.

292
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,636
I am the child my mother had
with her ex-husband.

293
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:52,596
My mother hated her past,
so she pushed me away and ignored me.

294
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:56,796
I had no choice but to lower myself
and try to please you and father.

295
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,675
But what can be changed
even if I'm humbled to the dust?

296
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:04,796
He only thought of me
when he needed a ghost bride.

297
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:07,475
Why me?

298
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:11,035
Please, Father. Don't make me go through
with the ghost marriage.

299
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:12,156
I'm begging you.

300
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:13,435
- Xue'er, get up.
- I beg you.

301
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:18,876
Xue'er, listen to me.
I've arranged everything.

302
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:19,596
If you do it...

303
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:23,876
Why me? Why not Ailian or Shuangshuang?

304
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:28,156
Is it because I'm not
your biological daughter?

305
00:22:29,356 --> 00:22:32,995
I know you can't let your daughters die.

306
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:36,636
How did you know?
Although I'm not your biological father,

307
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:38,995
I've been treating you well
all these years.

308
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:41,876
This is the only feasible way.

309
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:43,796
You have to listen to me.

310
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:47,755
- I won't.
- Xue'er.

311
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:48,955
I won't do it!

312
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:49,836
Xue'er!

313
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:56,316
Xue'er.

314
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:08,435
Father, are you alright?

315
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:15,435
You must listen to me...

316
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:20,396
I don't want to. No way!

317
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:31,076
Listen to me, Xue'er.

318
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:41,235
No way!

319
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:12,235
(I didn't mean to kill Father.)

320
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:15,275
I did it for self-defense.

321
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:19,796
I begged him, but he still forced me.

322
00:24:20,515 --> 00:24:22,076
So I had no choice but to make the move.

323
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:26,916
Why are you and Shuangshuang so lucky?

324
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:32,596
The family paves the way
and looks out for you.

325
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:37,515
But I have nothing.

326
00:24:47,116 --> 00:24:52,755
I realize it now. To live a better life,
I must be unscrupulous.

327
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:57,740
I put the fragrant powder
in Shuangshuang's drawer to frame her.

328
00:24:58,836 --> 00:24:59,980
Mother always favors her.

329
00:25:01,156 --> 00:25:04,636
Even if it got exposed,
Mother would protect her at all costs.

330
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,116
But I never saw this coming, Ailian.

331
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,715
You were arrested as the murderer.

332
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:32,048
(Luo Ailian's Memorial Tablet)

333
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:35,116
I planned to let you flee secretly.

334
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:39,755
I thought you couldn't compete with me
if you were charged with patricide.

335
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:45,796
But you just had to
come back to find out the truth.

336
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:50,955
You forced my hand. I had no choice.

337
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:40,235
Ailian, I wasn't the one
who set the fire.

338
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:41,836
You can't blame me.

339
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:45,772
I let you go, but you had a death wish.

340
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,515
You left but then came back.

341
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:51,556
You brought this on yourself.

342
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:58,116
Later, I accidentally
found Mother's string bag.

343
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:04,356
I wanted to use General Xu
to get rid of her and Shuangshuang.

344
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:10,796
But she almost caught me.

345
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:35,755
Anyway, I will succeed sooner or later.

346
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:41,675
Aside from you, no one
in the Luo family is my opponent.

347
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:50,356
Right, Shuangshuang committed something
and was taken away by General Xu.

348
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,876
My luck has changed!

349
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:06,475
Ailian, I've always depended on you
and Father since I was little.

350
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:10,796
I thought I would secure a peaceful
and wealthy life.

351
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:16,356
But now I realize it's all an illusion.

352
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:20,076
All people are selfish.

353
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:32,675
Ailian, just watch.

354
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:37,876
I will show you
how I take back what I've lost

355
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:43,596
and become the new master
of the Luo family step by step.

356
00:28:52,784 --> 00:28:57,388
(Luo Ailian's Memorial Tablet)

357
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:21,836
Father, is that you? Father!

358
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:23,596
Miss Ailian.

359
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:32,275
Bin!

360
00:29:36,156 --> 00:29:40,195
Xue'er, stop.

361
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:46,995
Do you think you can change your fate
by changing your face?

362
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,316
No! Xue'er, don't kill me!

363
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:58,156
Danqing, are you alright?
Don't be afraid.

364
00:29:58,156 --> 00:30:02,348
Bin, Father, don't leave me.

365
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:07,475
Don't be afraid, Danqing. I'm here.

366
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:32,156
(Luo Residence)

367
00:30:32,156 --> 00:30:35,156
(You haven't eaten anything
since Shuangshuang was arrested.)

368
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:36,796
I know you're worried about her.

369
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:39,156
But take good care of yourself.

370
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:42,556
Have you found a way to get her out
with your connections?

371
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:51,836
Prefect Bai said
that the new general is perverse.

372
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,316
Can't figure out his tactics at all.

373
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:59,396
Shuangshuang is so delicate.
How will she endure life in jail?

374
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:02,275
I finally reunite with my daughter,

375
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,156
hoping to make up
for the years of neglect.

376
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:08,356
Yet she's been thrown into jail.

377
00:31:08,356 --> 00:31:12,156
Madam, Master Jizhou.

378
00:31:12,156 --> 00:31:14,235
When I passed by the General's Mansion
on my way back,

379
00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:17,515
I heard that bees somehow got
into the prison cell

380
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:18,916
and stung Miss Shuangshuang.

381
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,275
Her face swelled up as big as a lantern.

382
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:22,116
- What?
- What?

383
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:24,755
Shuangshuang.

384
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:25,916
Madam.

385
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:29,636
How is Luo Shuangshuang?

386
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:31,836
The doctor said she's fine.

387
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,995
She's just frightened
and talking nonsense.

388
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:36,596
Send someone to take good care of her.

389
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,156
When Luo Shuangshuang was complaining,

390
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:42,916
she said she heard rumors that I liked
the fragrance from the Western Regions,

391
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,796
so she came to woo me
with the fragrance.

392
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:49,316
I guess the female bandit
used Luo Shuangshuang as a scapegoat.

393
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:53,916
The bandit chose her,
which means they have issues.

394
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:57,356
So you intentionally
imprisoned Luo Shuangshuang

395
00:31:57,356 --> 00:31:58,955
to use her as bait

396
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:01,316
and make the female bandit
take the next step.

397
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:06,755
General, I carefully inspected the area
as per your orders

398
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:10,675
and found a dried footprint
outside the prison cell.

399
00:32:12,195 --> 00:32:14,796
Judging by the size of the footprint,
it should be a pair of women's shoes.

400
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:18,316
Perhaps it was left
by that female bandit.

401
00:32:18,995 --> 00:32:20,636
The pattern on the sole is uncommon.

402
00:32:20,636 --> 00:32:22,836
Take this and inquire
at every shoe store.

403
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:23,396
Yes.

404
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:28,836
(Shen Mansion)
(All onto the cart.)

405
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:31,515
Everything is ready.
We can set off immediately.

406
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:32,876
Alright.

407
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:33,715
Zishan.

408
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,035
Miss Shen.

409
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:38,916
You're not well yet.
How come you're out?

410
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:42,396
Mr. Qin, you go ahead with the men.

411
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:44,116
Let's not waste any time.
I'll catch up with you.

412
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:44,636
Yes.

413
00:32:46,876 --> 00:32:50,316
I will be away for half a month at most.

414
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,596
Pay more attention to Father's health.

415
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:53,916
No worries.

416
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:58,076
Actually, I'm most worried about you.

417
00:32:58,796 --> 00:33:01,636
Luo Xue'er is deep and cunning.
She's not easy to deal with.

418
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:06,275
Indeed, but I already have a plan.

419
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:08,235
I'm lying low.

420
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:12,156
I will bide my time and make my move.

421
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:14,916
Okay, there's one more thing.

422
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:17,475
I feel that Xu Chengfeng
will not let it go.

423
00:33:18,116 --> 00:33:20,076
Don't continue your vengeance
when I am not here.

424
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:23,180
You can't handle him alone.
Wait until I get back.

425
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:27,116
If he interrogates me again,
I'll just deny everything.

426
00:33:27,116 --> 00:33:30,116
He has no evidence
and can't just forcibly take me away.

427
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:36,204
Mr. Miao told me that you were the one
taking care of me yesterday.

428
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,755
Thank you, Zishan.

429
00:33:40,475 --> 00:33:41,796
I've embroidered a sachet.

430
00:33:41,796 --> 00:33:43,788
Inside, I've put some herbs
to clear your mind.

431
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,156
You are always traveling outside.

432
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:49,475
I hope it will help you stay spirited
and relieve your fatigue.

433
00:33:59,076 --> 00:33:59,836
Thank you.

434
00:34:00,596 --> 00:34:02,596
You're my brother. No need to thank me.

435
00:34:03,396 --> 00:34:07,235
But if you don't start off now,
you'll not catch up with Mr. Qin.

436
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:10,515
Okay.

437
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:25,115
Mother, you're awake.

438
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:30,196
Why is it you?
I get annoyed just seeing you.

439
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,035
Where's Shuixian? Get Shuixian here.

440
00:34:34,276 --> 00:34:37,115
Mother, have some pear soup
to soothe your throat.

441
00:34:40,236 --> 00:34:41,876
Why is it red?

442
00:34:44,155 --> 00:34:45,236
You've poisoned it.

443
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,196
Someone!

444
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:50,316
- Mother, don't be mad.
- Someone!

445
00:34:50,316 --> 00:34:51,075
Lie down.

446
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:53,396
- Lie down, Mother.
- Shuixian. You back off.

447
00:34:56,316 --> 00:34:57,876
Madam, Miss Xue'er...

448
00:35:00,955 --> 00:35:02,836
Are you bleeding
because of a gentle push?

449
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:05,155
Madam, Miss Xue'er...

450
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:08,236
Stop it. I accidentally hurt myself.

451
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:09,955
Lift up your sleeve and let me see.

452
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:14,515
Let me have a look.

453
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,035
Madam, after you fell ill,

454
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:21,276
Miss Xue'er found the best doctor
to treat you.

455
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:24,836
The doctor said human blood was needed
as a guiding drug for quicker recovery.

456
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:27,396
Without hesitation,
Miss Xue'er slit her wrist.

457
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:28,796
She dripped her blood
into that pear soup.

458
00:35:30,435 --> 00:35:34,475
Mother, do you still think
I want to poison you?

459
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:36,796
This really surprises me.

460
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,316
You were not filial before.

461
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:43,955
You really don't have to be now.

462
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:48,396
Fine, I'll go back
to the ancestral hall right away.

463
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,555
So you won't be annoyed.

464
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:58,196
Madam, why did drive her away?

465
00:35:58,196 --> 00:36:00,196
Miss Xue'er is very nice to you.

466
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:00,916
Shut up.

467
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,635
Let's see
when you'll come chasing after me.

468
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:21,236
Miss Xue'er.

469
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,155
Has my mother calmed down yet?

470
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:26,595
Madam wants to see you.

471
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:28,316
Okay.

472
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:30,155
(Why are you upset?)

473
00:36:30,836 --> 00:36:34,075
You distanced yourself from me
and tried to please Luo Ailian before.

474
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:35,276
So I thought of you that way.

475
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:40,435
Mother, have you ever thought
why I pushed you away and pleased her?

476
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:45,435
You despised me for being a concubine,
trying to flatter the trueborn daughter.

477
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,836
But if I hadn't gained her trust,

478
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:51,155
could you still live comfortably

479
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,396
if Luo Ailian took charge of the house?

480
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:56,796
I planned it all for the three of us.

481
00:36:56,796 --> 00:36:59,276
Alright. You tell me.

482
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:01,236
You said the three of us?

483
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:03,716
Why didn't you hand over the string bag
to me immediately after finding it?

484
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:04,836
Why would you find General Xu?

485
00:37:07,396 --> 00:37:10,155
Mother, I admit I made a mistake.

486
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:14,635
Father and Luo Ailian passed away,
and you don't like me.

487
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:17,756
I didn't know how to protect myself
in this house in the future.

488
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:20,555
Just in case one day you abandon me,

489
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,995
I keep the string bag as a precaution.

490
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:28,716
As a precaution?
I think you wanted to expose me.

491
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:31,724
No, Mother, I did it
just to protect myself.

492
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:33,644
I never thought of
handing over the string bag.

493
00:37:33,644 --> 00:37:37,035
I didn't know General Xu would appear
at the corner gate that day.

494
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:39,660
Maybe I looked timid,

495
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,595
so he wanted to pry something out of me.

496
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:45,916
Mother, you and Shuangshuang
are my loved ones and reliance.

497
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:50,515
I don't hope that you can forgive me.

498
00:37:51,196 --> 00:37:55,515
I just want to make amends
for the wrong I've done.

499
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,276
It's not entirely your fault.

500
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:11,035
You've suffered a lot over the years.

501
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:13,836
Let's find a way to save Shuangshuang.

502
00:38:14,396 --> 00:38:15,595
When Shuangshuang comes back,

503
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:18,716
you two should support each other
and manage the Ganlu Brewery well.

504
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:22,236
Mother, rest assured,
I will definitely assist my sister.

505
00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:25,955
Uncle.

506
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:30,435
I need to talk to him.

507
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:31,515
You go back and rest.

508
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:42,276
Xue'er has always been estranged
from you.

509
00:38:43,435 --> 00:38:45,115
How come you two suddenly become close?

510
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:49,475
We've gained power,
so she starts to make her peace with us.

511
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:52,155
Does that mean you two are good?

512
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:56,635
Jizhou, you know it.

513
00:38:57,555 --> 00:38:59,396
I had her
before I entered the Luo family.

514
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:01,475
Although she is unaware of this,

515
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:03,396
every time I see her,

516
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:05,515
I will think of that rat
who treated me poorly.

517
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:08,635
Besides, she has been against me.

518
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:11,236
We've turned away from each other
for so long.

519
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:12,916
It's hard
to repair relations right away.

520
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:16,716
