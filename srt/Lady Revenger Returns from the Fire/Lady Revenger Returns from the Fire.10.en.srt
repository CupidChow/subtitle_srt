00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:18,880
=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,408
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,160
(General's Mansion)

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,112
The study is a place of secrecy.

5
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,200
You can't come in without knocking.

6
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,400
General, you had General Tianhao tell me

7
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,920
to come and serve you.

8
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,280
The door wasn't closed,
so I just walked in.

9
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,439
Next time, do not approach
the study without my permission.

10
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,599
Alright, General, I just made
the tuckahoe lotus cake.

11
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,159
Would you like some? Have a try.

12
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,200
Just a bite.

13
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,079
Have a taste, please.

14
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,520
It's alright, but the taste is ordinary.

15
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,328
General, I only gave it a small try.

16
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,840
There's plenty of time for us,
and I'll make something tastier.

17
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,960
General.

18
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,240
Leave us.

19
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,319
General, remember to finish it.

20
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:39,319
What is it?

21
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,280
Our informant said the target will appear
at the ruined temple at Zi hour.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,919
Are you sure it's the ruined temple?

23
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,336
Positive.

24
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:52,479
Good. Today at Zi hour, we will
capture the target once and for all.

25
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,319
A bunch of good-for-nothings.

26
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,568
Why didn't the target appear last night?

27
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,520
The target is said to be suspicious.

28
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,879
Perhaps it was
false information left on purpose.

29
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,560
Fortunately, we did not
reveal ourselves yesterday.

30
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
Tonight, the informant says
the target will definitely appear.

31
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,159
Informant? You have the nerve
to call them an informant?

32
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
What if it goes south again?

33
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,800
I'd rather die than fail again.

34
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,952
(Good thing I was cautious.)

35
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,680
(I wanted to verify the information
before reporting to His Highness.)

36
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,120
(Otherwise, His Highness
would certainly blame me.)

37
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
General, how was my act? Was it good?

38
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
(Prince Yi's Mansion)
(Xu used Lv Zhu to give us false info.)

39
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,879
Fortunately, you didn't take the bait.

40
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,920
You have trained so many
courageous and resourceful assassins

41
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,168
and so many talented women.
Why did you choose Lv Zhu?

42
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,944
She is beautiful,
but she's not brilliant.

43
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,360
She can't even discern
such obvious false information.

44
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,424
Xu Chengfeng must be laughing at us.

45
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,040
Even if I were to send the fiercest
assassin to Xu Chengfeng's side,

46
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,519
he would still be on guard.

47
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,319
Only a true foolish beauty could
make him gradually lower his guard.

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,040
You're saying

49
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,680
that the more mistakes Lv Zhu makes,
the more he will underestimate us.

50
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,519
I never expected Lv Zhu

51
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,480
to bring back any important secrets.

52
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,079
We only need to extract
the information we need

53
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,160
from Xu Chengfeng's casual remarks.

54
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,399
Extract information from casual remarks?

55
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,639
For example, what is the General's mood
upon returning from official duties?

56
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,319
Or, who has been frequently visiting
the General's Mansion lately?

57
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,000
These pieces of information
may seem trivial but are very useful.

58
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,519
Enlighten me, please.

59
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,360
The general's mood can not only
indicate the investigation progress,

60
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,519
but may also suggest that something
might have happened during the day.

61
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,480
Those who frequently visit
his mansion fall into two categories.

62
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,079
One is those who come
for official business.

63
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,160
And the other is
those he wants to be close to.

64
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,439
These pieces of information
can be utilized to manipulate him.

65
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,560
The art of war prioritizes psychological
moves. You're so wise, Your Highness.

66
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,639
General, I specially made some
Qizi pastries for you this time.

67
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,759
I'm sure they're new to you.

68
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,720
The name does sound novel.

69
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,608
These pastries symbolize
prosperous and smooth days.

70
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,800
I fear that in the entire Liao City,
no one makes them better than I do.

71
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,992
General, let me feed you one.

72
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,920
Lv Zhu, just leave it here.
I'll help myself.

73
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,136
General, I'm here
specifically to serve you.

74
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:00,800
Lv Zhu.

75
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,639
- General.
- General.

76
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,399
I'm here to serve you.

77
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,000
Miss Shen is here.

78
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,680
Miss Shen...

79
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,480
General, please try one.

80
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,000
Knock it off.

81
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,680
Miss Shen, what brings you here?

82
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,439
It seems I've interrupted
your pleasant moment.

83
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,368
Perhaps I should come another day.

84
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,439
Miss Shen, I am
the general's personal maid.

85
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,199
Pleasure.

86
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,959
Lv Zhu, I need to talk
to Miss Shen. Leave us.

87
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,759
But...

88
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,959
Lv Zhu, I need you to come with me.

89
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,000
General, I wish to stay
and attend to you closely.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,279
Miss Shen, please.

91
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,399
No, you don't. Come on.

92
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,040
General.

93
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,600
Qizi pastries.

94
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,959
Miss Shen, have you had
Qizi pastries before?

95
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,199
When I was little, my mother
would often make them for me.

96
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,839
She said they had a good omen
and wished me good luck.

97
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,639
After she passed away,
I never had them again.

98
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,480
I see. Well then, this is perfect.

99
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,000
Try it and see if the taste is right.

100
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,839
These were specially made
by Miss Lv Zhu for you, General.

101
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,800
They represent her heartfelt effort.
I'd rather not try them.

102
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,399
Food is the foremost desire of people.

103
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,319
You're lucky, General.

104
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,240
Miss Shen, you are mistaken.
It's not what you think.

105
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,080
Oh, what is it then?

106
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,600
Lv Zhu is merely a secret agent
from my archenemy, Prince Yi.

107
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,159
She is specifically sent to spy on me.

108
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,799
You truly don't treat me
like an outsider.

109
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,200
It's just a pity
for Miss Lv Zhu's beauty

110
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
and her excellent skills.

111
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,600
Otherwise, she would be
a good match for you.

112
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,919
It'd be a wonderful story.

113
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,399
It seems like I am not fortunate
enough to enjoy that.

114
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,440
General, you lack romantic senses.

115
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,519
Since Lv Zhu is a spy sent by Prince Yi,

116
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,799
then Prince Yi must trust her a lot.

117
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,240
So, General, you can't reject her.

118
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,519
What do you propose, Miss Shen?

119
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,679
Of course, you have to utilize
your charm as a handsome man.

120
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,679
Make her fall hopelessly
in love with you

121
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,000
and reveal
all of Prince Yi's secrets to you.

122
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,159
It sounds like you want me
to seduce Lv Zhu.

123
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,000
After all, Lv Zhu intends to seduce you.

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why don't you counter her scheme
by letting her succeed

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,600
and capture her heart for your use?

126
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,159
Or do you lack confidence in your charm?

127
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,159
Funny. Even the noble ladies
and princesses in the capital city

128
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,360
are charmed by me,

129
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,759
let alone a minor secret agent.

130
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,759
Yes, I've heard it before. Young ladies
of Liao City dressed up

131
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,639
and almost surrounded your mansion.

132
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,279
Moreover, I've heard that you prefer
women with a natural fragrance.

133
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,799
Miss Shen, what brings
you here today, exactly?

134
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,919
Zishan guessed that you had already
read the contents of the diary.

135
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,559
So, he asked me to come at Shen hour

136
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,080
to discuss the next steps with you.

137
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,240
There's still a quarter until then.
I'll brew a pot of tea for you.

138
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,480
(Miss Shen, I had you
serve me tea before.)

139
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,840
Consider this as me returning the favor.

140
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,759
Thank you, General.

141
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,480
It smells so good. How did you know
that I like strong floral tea?

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
Like I said, I've met countless people.
Miss Shen, yet you didn't believe.

143
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,399
How about this. I will guess about you.

144
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,000
Sure, I'm all ears.

145
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,840
Although you are a woman,

146
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,679
you lack the gentle, sweet,
and tender virtues expected of one.

147
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,919
Instead, you're full of schemes, speak
without restraint, and are lawless.

148
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,559
I can now declare that you are
destined to be alone for life.

149
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,919
However, it is precisely
this rebelliousness

150
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,600
that has made you the most unique woman.

151
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,200
You're bold and your actions
are decisive.

152
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
You're as persistent
and resourceful as men,

153
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,120
with a vision and mindset
even higher than men's.

154
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,600
That's pretty well said.

155
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,159
As the saying goes,
women are no less than men.

156
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,759
What about men, and what about women?

157
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,519
Considering the sincerity in your words,

158
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,519
I take back what I just said.

159
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,200
But you will not pursue romantic affairs
like most women do,

160
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
nor will you be content with a family.

161
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,000
You have your own desires.

162
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,320
Hence, you will devote
all your efforts to this goal.

163
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,559
As the daughter of an escort agency,
I won't be confined under a low eave.

164
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,720
Yet growing up in a noted family
like this,

165
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,600
you have great courage,
decisiveness, and perseverance.

166
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,360
I wonder, as a lady of an escort agency,

167
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,159
what kind of experiences
you must have gone through

168
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,679
to have become so distinguished
from the others now.

169
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,480
(He doesn't know I am Luo Ailian,)

170
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,960
(yet he could speak
so accurately of my past.)

171
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,200
Miss Shen.

172
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,759
I know you are reluctant
to confide your matters to others.

173
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,360
However, I indeed am a good friend.
You can share your innermost feelings,

174
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
if you are willing.

175
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:11,144
♪I've created candlelight in darkness♪

176
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,120
General, Young Master Shen is here.

177
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,440
Zishan has come. I'll go get him.

178
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,399
This was left to me by my mother.
I regard it as precious as life.

179
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I am willing to give my jade pendant
to you as a token.

180
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,120
If I find out the truth,
I will ask you for the token back.

181
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,799
If I cannot prove my innocence,

182
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,120
I am willing to be shattered like jade,
to demonstrate my resolve in death.

183
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,200
Then I'll wait for you to come
and get this jade pendant back from me.

184
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,159
(I can't believe he's kept
this jade pendant all this time.)

185
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,520
Sorry, there was some trouble on the way
while escorting the cargo.

186
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,879
It's alright. I have prepared some wine
and dishes. Let's talk over dinner.

187
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,639
Danqing, what's wrong?

188
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,039
I'm feeling unwell.
I want to go back first.

189
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,120
Zishan, you can talk with General Xu.

190
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll take you back. I'm not at ease
with you going back alone.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,992
Chengfeng, let's do it another time.

192
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,399
Okay.

193
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,480
Danqing.

194
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,360
During the escort today,

195
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,279
the client sent some top-quality
bird's nest as a gift.

196
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,440
I had Shuixian stew it
to help you build up health.

197
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,919
Thank you, Zishan.

198
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,840
Take a seat.

199
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,559
Today at the General's Mansion, you
seemed unwell.

200
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:01,840
Has something happened?

201
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,799
I saw the jade pendant
my mother left me.

202
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,759
Luo Ailian has been
dead for so long now,

203
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,879
and I thought no one in this world
would remember her anymore.

204
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,320
But General Xu still keeps her things.

205
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,960
He still remembers.

206
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,120
I remember too.

207
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,440
I remember the first time
I saw Luo Ailian.

208
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,320
I remember how she
broke through the thorns later,

209
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,159
but I know that she is now Shen Danqing.

210
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,679
I will keep the secret
of my identity in my heart.

211
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,440
I won't reveal a hint
to General Xu either.

212
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,880
I'll keep this secret with you.

213
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,359
When you're with me,
you can be anyone you want to be

214
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,759
and do anything you want to do.

215
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,680
Thank you, Zishan.

216
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,632
Xue'er.

217
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:49,832
What's wrong?

218
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,839
Xue'er, I'm scared of the thunder.

219
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,440
On normal days when it thunders,
I sleep with Mother.

220
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,880
Today she isn't here.
Can I sleep with you?

221
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,519
You nearly scared me to death.
Come on up.

222
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,880
Xue'er, Mother has been in prison
for several days now

223
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,680
Have you thought of a way to save her?

224
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,519
I've been trying.

225
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,000
But that old man Luo Jizhou has been
lying sick in the backyard for so long

226
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,000
and I've been taking care of
all the family matters.

227
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,279
I really didn't have time.

228
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,720
Besides, Mother confessed
publicly to protect us.

229
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,920
If I were to try to save her now
in the eye of the storm,

230
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,599
we might fail and even endanger
ourselves and let Mother down.

231
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,759
But I really miss her.

232
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,680
I've been in that prison.

233
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,559
It's really not a place for people.

234
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,944
Just thinking of Mother suffering there,

235
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,160
my heart can't be at ease.

236
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,400
This is all my fault.
I got Mother in trouble.

237
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,319
Xue'er, I'm not going to die, am I?

238
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,880
Nonsense. you're just worried
about Mother and overthinking it.

239
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,519
Don't worry, I will
find a way to save Mother.

240
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,599
Xue'er, I believe in you.

241
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,559
Alright, I'll send someone to take you
to the manor to get better.

242
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,000
The air is good there.
Take care of yourself first.

243
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,599
Go to sleep now.

244
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,400
Okay.

245
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,039
The lotus flowers are really beautiful.

246
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,440
Since I saw you practice
ink and wash painting,

247
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,680
you were always painting lotus flowers.

248
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,920
You must really like them.

249
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,599
So I had someone plant
these lotus flowers here.

250
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,240
Thank you, Zishan.
The lotus flowers are truly beautiful.

251
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,680
Do you like them?

252
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,559
When I learned winemaking
with Father before,

253
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,720
we enjoyed the lotus flowers.

254
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,960
Father said that the dew on their leaves
after rain is the best for brewing wine.

255
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,119
Thinking back, those
were really carefree times.

256
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,519
Master Jizhou has fallen into a coma,
and Ms. Zhou has been imprisoned.

257
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,279
After you take care of Shuangshuang
and Luo Xue'er,

258
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,160
I will take you to enjoy the beauty
of mountains, rivers and flowers.

259
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,200
Your smile seems
different from Danqing's.

260
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:05,480
I mean, I haven't seen you
smile like this in a long time.

261
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,240
From now on, just be yourself
without any worries by my side.

262
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,079
Regardless of whether
I'll be carefree in the future,

263
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,319
I am very happy at this moment.

264
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,680
Thank you, Zishan, for always being
by my side and giving me a family.

265
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,839
Shall we go further?

266
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,880
Sure.

267
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,839
Let's go.

268
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,319
Mother. Why are they
treating you like this?

269
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,680
With my current situation,

270
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,960
it is already generous of them
not to sentence me to hanging.

271
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm sorry, Mother.
I didn't manage things well.

272
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,720
I will go to Prefect Bai
and confess my crime.

273
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
I'll tell him that it was all my idea.

274
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
Let him lock me up and release you.

275
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,480
Silly child, what nonsense
are you talking about?

276
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,839
There was thunder last night, right?
Was Shuangshuang scared?

277
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,440
Did she ask to share your bed?

278
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,359
Hmm.

279
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,480
Shuangshuang is innocent, and she
is not as far-sighted as you.

280
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,319
Bear with her more.

281
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,920
Mother, rest assured, I will
take good care of Shuangshuang.

282
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,759
She is still at home
waiting for you to return.

283
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,559
Prefect Bai has been questioned
for shielding us before.

284
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,160
It will probably cost quite a lot
to ask for his help now.

285
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,559
I have asked him

286
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,799
and Prefect Bai said
you have to wait a little longer.

287
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,039
Once the attention dies down,
with 200,000 taels, you can be released.

288
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,640
200,000 taels?

289
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,960
I've checked our account.

290
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,599
Plus selling the manor
and the old house,

291
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,480
we can scramble 40 to 50 thousand.

292
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,119
I will borrow the rest of the money.

293
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,720
Even if it means bowing down to others,
I must raise the full amount.

294
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
200,000 taels.

295
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,680
The Luo family's savings
might just be enough.

296
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,440
Mother, where would
our family get so much money?

297
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,920
I have carefully settled the accounts.

298
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,480
There is a new grave
in the southwest corner of Jida's grave.

299
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,000
What is buried there is not a person,

300
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,240
but the treasure of the Luo family.

301
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,640
There are at least 150,000 taels inside.

302
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,960
Dig them out and save me.

303
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,064
Okay.

304
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,400
Now there's hope.

305
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,720
(Prison)
Miss Xue'er, you've finished your talk.

306
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,160
As long as you command, Miss Xue'er,

307
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,880
we'll definitely take
good care of Madam Zhou.

308
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,768
We will present
the wound-healing cream shortly.

309
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:27,000
As long as you can give me some...

310
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,376
No. Even the Emperor's transgressions
are subject to the same laws,

311
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,079
not to mention my own mother.

312
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:33,759
But...

313
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,960
Treat her the same way
you would treat any criminal. Go away.

314
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,920
150,000 taels! I can't believe
you actually hid that much.

315
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,480
Such a pity. Despite all the scheming,
you still couldn't outwit me.

316
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,759
Save you? In your dreams.

317
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,960
The treasure is all mine now.

318
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,119
Miss, I've inquired
at the yamen's prison.

319
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,119
Luo Xue'er has gone to the prison.
So she still wants to save Ms. Zhou.

320
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,079
Murder is no minor crime.

321
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,319
It won't be easy to rescue her.

322
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,759
Besides, Luo Xue'er is skilled
at disguising and scheming.

323
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,680
Her eagerness to save her mother
may just be an act she wants to put on.

324
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,264
Are you suggesting Luo Xue'er
might have other motives?

325
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,848
Now with Ms. Zhou in prison, it's a good
opportunity for her to rise in position.

326
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,672
She will not miss such an opportunity.

327
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,079
I didn't know she is such a schemer.

328
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,880
What's your plan then?

329
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,240
Strike the viper at its vital point.

330
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,359
Whatever Luo Xue'er wants,
I shall take away.

331
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,720
Father, are you well down there?

332
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,680
Stir-fried lamb and spicy tofu were your
favorite dishes when you were alive.

333
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,240
(Beloved Father Luo Jida)

334
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,039
I personally made
and brought them for you.

335
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,799
Even if I did well,
what use would it be?

336
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,000
I've done so many things
to win your favor.

337
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,759
But I still couldn't
compare to Luo Ailian.

338
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:38,920
I studied so hard and worked hard
to learn how to brew wine,

339
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,079
but you only paid attention to her.

340
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,640
Why should I humble myself
to be her lackey?

341
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,160
Why should I be cautious
and meticulous with everyone at home

342
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
just because I'm not
your biological daughter?

343
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,079
So when arranging for a ghost marriage,
you only thought of sacrificing me.

344
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,880
But it is because of this

345
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,480
that I understand I can only
rely on myself to get what I want.

346
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,799
You couldn't have imagined

347
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,480
that the one supporting the Luo family
isn't your most beloved Luo Ailian,

348
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,119
nor Mother's most indulged
Luo Shuangshuang.

349
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,599
It's me, Luo Xue'er.

350
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,079
(Beloved Father Luo Jida)
You once seized my birth father's property.

351
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,599
Now I shall take back
everything that belongs to me.

352
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,480
As for you, if your spirit is around,
you can watch.

353
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,680
Watch how I make my mark
and claim the Luo family as my own.

354
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,319
(How can there be so much water?)

355
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,039
(This is the mouth of a spring.
A Mountain spring.)

356
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,824
I'll send this piece of clothing
for Lv Zhu to wash. Good night.

357
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,160
Okay.

358
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,119
General, are you asleep?

359
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,160
What's going on?

360
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,880
I don't know either.

361
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,640
Then I will come in now.

362
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,359
General, I specially made some
sweet fermented rice dumplings.

363
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,440
Would you like to try them?

364
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,839
General Tianhao, please go out
and close the door behind you.

365
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,960
Then I'll take my leave now.

366
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,599
General, cherish this beautiful night
while taking care of your health.

367
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,839
Tianhao. Tianhao. Tianhao!

368
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,279
General, these are the sweet
fermented rice dumplings I made myself.

369
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,559
Would you like some?

370
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,720
Miss Lv Zhu, please go back quickly.

371
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,160
General, it's not late yet.
Once you've tried them, I will go back.

372
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,920
Wait.

373
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,359
Let me cool them for you.

374
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:38,839
These sweet fermented
rice dumplings are tasty.

375
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,359
- But...
- Have a taste.

376
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:40,920
I...

377
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,319
Come on, they're sweet.

378
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,799
- No.
- General, try it.

379
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:50,079
Miss Lv Zhu! Tianhao, get in here!

380
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,960
General, you're so ruthless.

381
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,240
Carry her back for me and then
return to stand guard as punishment.

382
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:06,119
She's been knocked out.
Why do I need to guard the door?

383
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,920
Guard it.

384
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,839
Fine, I won't get any sleep tonight.

385
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:16,840
(Shen Mansion)

386
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,119
I've acquired the candied fruit shop
opposite Ganlu Brewery for you.

387
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,039
I've had my eye on that shop for long.

388
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,839
I know. As long as
it's something you like,

389
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,680
I will do my utmost to get it for you.

390
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,440
You like brewing wine.

391
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:32,972
Opening a winery
has been your dream, right?

392
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,160
I have other purposes as well.

393
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,880
Ms. Zhou and Uncle Jizhou
got their comeuppance.

394
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,200
Now Ganlu Brewery has fallen
into the hands of Luo Xue'er.

395
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:49,640
I want to take back
the Luo family's winery

396
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,759
and compete head-on with her,
using my best skill, brewing

397
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,799
and make her pay back
double what she owes me.

398
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,000
I will make the Luo family's
winery business prosper.

399
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,319
Zishan, will you support me?

400
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,440
Of course, I have personally chosen
the craftsmen for the renovation.

401
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,792
They've had a reputation
in Liao City for years.

402
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,608
They will certainly help you
manage the shop properly.

403
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,559
How lucky am I to meet
such a good brother like you?

404
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,359
I'm the lucky one. You've always been
investigating the matter of my sister

405
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,759
and facilitating my collaboration
with Xu Chengfeng.

406
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,759
I'm lucky to have you.

407
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,000
The Shen family is lucky.

408
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,359
(My winery is about to open.)

409
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,079
(Luo Xue'er, we can finally
face off directly.)

410
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,039
It used to be a candied fruit shop,
right? Has it been cashed out?

411
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,000
It was fine a few days ago.

412
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,799
Go find out who the new owner is
and what business they do.

413
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,000
Yes.

414
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:22,664
(Danqing Winery)

415
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,920
It's bad, Miss. We have to do something.

416
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,559
Speak slowly.

417
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,799
The landlord took people to the shop

418
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,319
made a mess of the store
that was almost refurbished,

419
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,640
and even drove away the craftsmen.

420
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,472
You must be the landlord, Ms. Song.
I am the tenant, Shen Danqing.

421
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:45,039
I want to ask you why
you won't let us renovate.

422
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:50,504
You only said you were renting.
You didn't mention renovating.

423
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,920
Your renovation and arrangement
have ruined my layout and feng shui.

424
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,640
Do you know that? You must give me
another 500 taels as compensation.

425
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,880
500 taels?

426
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,400
You're jacking up the price on the spot.

427
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,880
It's not your place to speak.

428
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,279
Either pay up or get out.

429
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:07,680
Speak nicely. She is the young lady
of Shen Escort Agency.

430
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,119
I don't care who you are. Get lost.

431
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:10,888
You...

432
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,239
No, General, please hear me out.

433
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,159
This item is so valuable,
yet the box is so small.

434
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,840
In the future, we should buy
what looks very impressive.

435
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,960
We didn't say we wouldn't pay.
I'll go get it right now.

436
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,159
Miss, isn't this place
close to the General's Mansion?

437
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,559
I'll go find General Xu and have him
send over 500 taels immediately.

438
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,440
Hold on.

439
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,840
Isn't that Miss Shen?

440
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,079
The General's Mansion?
Who are you to General Xu?

441
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,559
Why do you ask so much, lady?
Just take the money and go.

442
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,760
You see, our Miss Shen
is General Xu's beloved.

443
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,519
General Xu runs after her every day.

444
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,400
He is extraordinarily attentive.

445
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,840
What? You are General Xu's beloved?

446
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,280
Lady, don't listen to her nonsense.

447
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,760
The general and I share interests
and some opinions, that's all.

448
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,239
He occasionally sends
small gifts, that's it.

449
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,960
Miss, I haven't spoken nonsense.

450
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,559
Hasn't General Xu admired you
for a long time?

451
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:18,639
You can't fabricate stories about
my private affairs with the general.

452
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,199
Be careful, or I will punish you.

453
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:20,920
- Miss.
- You...

454
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,280
You're always so reckless.
What if you get hurt?

455
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,280
Fortunately, I can always protect you.

456
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,519
Besides, what Shuixian
just said was not wrong.

457
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,880
I've admired you for a long time,
and it's obvious to anyone with eyes.

458
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,639
Why are you so mad with her?

459
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,559
These must be gifts
for Miss Shen, right?

460
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,920
- That's right.
- Right?

461
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,760
I have spent a fortune just to win
a smile from a beautiful lady.

462
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,880
General Xu, g-greetings.

463
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,160
Madam, there's no need
for such courtesy.

464
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,639
Thank you for renting
this place to Danqing

465
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,400
and allowing her to fulfill her dream.

466
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:21,320
Danqing, if you need anything, just ask.

467
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,599
I will fulfill all your needs.

468
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,840
Actually, it's not a big deal,
but Ms. Song said

469
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,800
if I renovate, I'd have to pay
500 taels in compensation.

470
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,440
500 taels?

471
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,760
Is that so?

472
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,679
No, it's all a misunderstanding.

473
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:41,800
Miss Shen, continue with the...

474
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,320
Go ahead.

475
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,519
- What?
- What?

476
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,079
The renovation.

477
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,039
We're leaving now.

478
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,199
Wait. I have one more thing to ask you.

479
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,632
You never mentioned anything
about feng shui before. Why today?

480
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:58,480
It was Miss Xue'er of Ganlu Brewery.

481
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,079
She told me
that your business would jinx me.

482
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:07,559
Lately, I've been feeling dizzy,
so I believed her nonsense.

483
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,480
It's because of your inner heat,
and it has nothing to do with feng shui.

484
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,960
I'll have Shuixian prepare
some herbal soup for you

485
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,159
and have it delivered to your home.

486
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,928
Thank you, Miss Shen. You're beautiful
and kind. I was wrong about you.

487
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,840
Next time, please don't
believe other people's nonsense.

488
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
All right.

489
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,039
Danqing is a sensible woman.

490
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,079
If she does well in business,
your rent will naturally increase.

491
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,000
Yes, then we'll take our leave.

492
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,360
Take care.

493
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,320
Hurry up.

494
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,159
With what you said,

495
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,719
she will surely raise
my rent in the future.

496
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,199
Are you afraid?

497
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,199
If it is raised, you will use me again.

498
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,760
We really do think alike.

499
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,440
Then I'll have to rely on you, General.

500
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
Indeed, we think alike.

501
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,800
Miss Shen is not only beautiful and kind
but also smart and eloquent.

502
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,239
Every time, her unexpected actions
leave a deep impression on me.

503
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,000
The general brings surprises as well.

504
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,360
Who knew General Xu would
be such a good actor?

505
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,199
You were so natural
with your sweet words.

506
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:15,840
I almost believed for a moment
that these were presents for me.

507
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,440
On the day of your opening, I will
personally bring you a generous gift.

508
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,039
