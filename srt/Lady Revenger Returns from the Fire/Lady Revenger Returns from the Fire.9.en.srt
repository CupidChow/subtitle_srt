=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:22,088
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:29,778
(Given the reactions
of Madam Zhou, Prefect Bai,)

4
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:30,978
(and the others in the morgue,)

5
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:32,618
(they all seemed to be unaware.)

6
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:35,618
(But a corpse couldn't just disappear.)

7
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:38,097
(There was so little blood
on the shroud.)

8
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,737
(Could it be)

9
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:42,618
(that Luo Jizhou is not dead?)

10
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:55,657
Shen Danqing, I really admire you.

11
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:57,218
Even at a time like this,

12
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,418
you can still remain calm.

13
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:00,457
I haven't killed anyone.

14
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:02,097
Why wouldn't I be calm?

15
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:04,338
Facing death
and still stubbornly pretending.

16
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:05,698
I think you're the stubborn one.

17
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:06,698
Luo Shuangshuang,

18
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,458
you are the killer.

19
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:09,218
What?

20
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:10,778
You dare not admit it?

21
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:11,400
You...!

22
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:12,137
That's nonsense!

23
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,938
It was you who killed him.

24
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:15,577
Does it matter who killed him?

25
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:17,857
You can't do anything to us now.

26
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,938
You two are starting to put on

27
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:25,857
the act of sisterhood now?

28
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:28,298
Luo Shuangshuang,

29
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,898
you did something wrong.
And you just hide

30
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:31,417
behind someone else and be useless.

31
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:34,058
Luo Xue'er helped you this time.
And then what?

32
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:34,697
Do you think

33
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:36,392
she will help you again?

34
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:36,936
You!

35
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:37,640
Don't be fooled.

36
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:39,738
She's trying
to drive a wedge between us.

37
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,537
I am very curious

38
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:42,938
why you have kept opposing

39
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:44,537
our family over and over again.

40
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,898
Then you truly wronged me.

41
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:49,137
I have never opposed your family.

42
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:51,298
I had always wanted
to do business with your family.

43
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:53,097
But you never cooperated.

44
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:56,618
And I just happened to know
your family's secrets,

45
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,377
which gave me leverage.

46
00:02:58,377 --> 00:02:59,697
So I intended

47
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:01,498
to discuss cooperation
with Master Jizhou.

48
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:03,338
All I wanted

49
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,537
was the money.

50
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:07,178
I'm not like you. You are so ruthless

51
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:09,657
that you even killed your own kin.

52
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:10,817
Cooperation?

53
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:12,498
You lowly wretch!

54
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:14,178
You were just trying to extort us again.

55
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:15,898
Shen Danqing,

56
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:18,097
no matter how true your words are,

57
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:19,697
you picked the wrong target.

58
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:21,857
I will not give you any chance
to turn things around.

59
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:25,377
Look at you two.

60
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:27,018
One is scheming and malicious.

61
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:28,298
And the other is selfish and reckless.

62
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:30,097
Sooner or later, you'll be punished.

63
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:32,417
I advise you

64
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:35,338
to do more good deeds
and accumulate virtue

65
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:37,338
so that you won't get your comeuppance.

66
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:40,338
Miss Shen,

67
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,738
no matter how eloquent and cunning

68
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:44,058
you are today,

69
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:45,377
it's all in vain.

70
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,018
Western Poisonous Spiders.

71
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:54,697
Whoever is bitten by one

72
00:03:54,977 --> 00:03:56,577
will die within four hours.

73
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:57,778
Shen Danqing,

74
00:03:57,898 --> 00:03:59,178
aren't you very capable?

75
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:00,458
Come out and hit me then.

76
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:02,097
I'd like to see

77
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:03,257
whether it's more painful

78
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,178
to be beaten or to be bitten by spiders.

79
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:15,938
Then, General,

80
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:17,938
please tell me all the details
of the entire process

81
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,257
of the investigation

82
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:20,658
over the past three months.

83
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:23,017
I will have Zong Wei
record everything by the side.

84
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,697
All the details?

85
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:28,457
All the details.

86
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:31,137
Okay.

87
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:34,098
If you have patience,

88
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:35,738
I will spare no detail

89
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:37,058
and tell you everything.

90
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:39,017
Tianhao,

91
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:39,897
go smash some walnuts

92
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,017
for me

93
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:42,377
to replenish my wits.

94
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:44,008
Okay.

95
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:57,858
Am I

96
00:04:58,418 --> 00:04:59,978
going to die here today?

97
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,577
(You must not forget your hatred.)

98
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:05,058
(It's not the last moment yet.)

99
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:07,178
(There must still be a chance.)

100
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:23,897
(Right,)

101
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:25,418
(General Xu.)

102
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:27,817
(In Liao City, only his position)

103
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:29,058
(ranks above Prefect Bai.)

104
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:31,817
(I must find a way
to send him a message.)

105
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:35,697
Help!

106
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,817
Help!

107
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:40,938
Is anybody there?

108
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:43,658
What's all this noise about?

109
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:45,137
Sir,

110
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:46,337
I've been poisoned.

111
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:48,298
I'm dying.

112
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:50,137
Could you...

113
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:54,498
Could you please do me a favor?

114
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,418
You are a death row inmate anyway.

115
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:57,377
You are dying?

116
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:58,938
You can die in your cell.

117
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:00,298
Don't expect me to help you.

118
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:01,457
Before I die,

119
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:03,337
there is something I want to tell

120
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:05,377
my friends and family.

121
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:07,257
Could you please

122
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:09,618
pass a message to them for me?

123
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:10,978
Rest assured.

124
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,337
I will repay you.

125
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:21,137
Then I'll be the good guy

126
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:22,418
and do you a favor.

127
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,738
I am struck
with a severe poison right now

128
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:33,337
and will surely die within four hours.

129
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:35,337
You've also been poisoned, just like me.

130
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:36,777
If you do not wish to die,

131
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,418
go to General's Mansion
and find General Xu.

132
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,418
And then go to the Shen family
to fetch Mr. Miao.

133
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,337
If you fail to complete either task,

134
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:45,098
you might as well
wait here with me to die.

135
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,178
I'll go right now.

136
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,777
You rise at Mao hour, eat at Chen hour,

137
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:03,938
relieve yourself at Si hour,
and bathe at noon.

138
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,257
General Xu, your life

139
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,178
is really regimented.

140
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:16,817
You said you wanted all the details.

141
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:18,858
I cannot spare any details.

142
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:20,738
Over the past three months,

143
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:22,858
I have been constantly pondering
this case.

144
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:24,418
If, by chance, I miss something,

145
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,618
you might misunderstand
that I'm deliberately hiding it

146
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:27,817
and report against me.

147
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:29,298
It would be an injustice to me.

148
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:30,577
General Xu,

149
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,658
I know what you are trying to do.

150
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:35,978
Isn't it just to waste my time?

151
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:38,577
Listen to me.

152
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:40,978
I have plenty of time to 'waste'.

153
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:42,538
Someone!

154
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,577
Bring all of my luggage inside.

155
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:47,178
Today, I'll stay at this mansion.

156
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:47,897
Yes!

157
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,017
If you don't find

158
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,738
my mansion under austere conditions,

159
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:53,618
not befitting your noble status,

160
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,137
feel free to stay.

161
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:57,418
General.

162
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:10,098
What audacity!

163
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:13,377
How dared you murmur in front of me?

164
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:14,377
Xu Chengfeng,

165
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,298
do you still dare say
you've hidden nothing?

166
00:08:17,457 --> 00:08:17,978
Your Highness,

167
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:19,817
I have just gotten

168
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,858
some relevant information
about the treasure map case.

169
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:25,538
Now I must go immediately
to gather evidence.

170
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:26,498
I'm leaving.

171
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:27,577
Very well.

172
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:30,418
I will go with you.

173
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:32,778
But that person also said

174
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,258
that they would only come clean
and hand over the evidence to me

175
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:36,737
if I went alone.

176
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:41,337
Do you take me for a fool?

177
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:44,538
Would you rather risk the crime
of defying an imperial edict

178
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,298
than tell me the information?

179
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:49,337
Fine.

180
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:52,817
Since you're being uncooperative,

181
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:55,378
I can only have Zong Wei
record everything truthfully

182
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:56,817
and send it to His Majesty

183
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:57,857
for him to read.

184
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,497
The imperial edict is clear,

185
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,977
mandating that we share all information.

186
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:02,217
You're forcing His Majesty

187
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:04,337
to charge you with the crime
of defying an imperial edict.

188
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,178
When the time comes,

189
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:08,378
do not blame me.

190
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:10,378
After all these years,

191
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:12,378
you have not made much progress.

192
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:14,857
In your penchant for tattling,

193
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:16,138
you certainly are consistent.

194
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:19,577
It's not the quantity of tactics,

195
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:21,617
but their effectiveness that matters.

196
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:24,857
Xu Chengfeng.

197
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,538
I just proclaimed
the imperial edict today,

198
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:28,938
and you're leaving in defiance of it.

199
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:30,178
Are you forcing me

200
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:31,938
to immediately report to His Majesty,

201
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:33,977
requesting to punish you
for defying an imperial edict

202
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:35,538
and have you escorted
back to the capital?

203
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,898
I've already delivered the message
to General Xu.

204
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:44,097
But he seems to be occupied

205
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:45,658
in his mansion

206
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:47,178
and is held up by someone.

207
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:49,217
He didn't come out.

208
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:51,298
Then I went to look for Mr. Miao.

209
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,217
But the Shen Mansion

210
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:55,938
has been surrounded
by people sent by Prefect Bai.

211
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:57,697
So,

212
00:09:58,658 --> 00:09:59,857
are we...

213
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:05,097
Are we going to die?

214
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:09,778
Normally,

215
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,497
when I think of Xu Chengfeng's face,

216
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:15,697
I feel like he's my nemesis.

217
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:18,298
But unexpectedly, at this moment,

218
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:21,378
I am desperately hoping

219
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:24,178
that he will appear by my side.

220
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:28,298
Did you mean it?

221
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:38,378
Aren't you held up

222
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:39,977
by something?

223
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:41,857
It's a small matter, and it's resolved.

224
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,898
Today, I must go out.

225
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:47,378
If I can't bring back useful evidence,

226
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:49,538
I am willing to return
to the capital with you

227
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,178
and accept my punishment
before His Majesty.

228
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:56,097
♪I've stepped into a maze,
stirring up all the chaos♪

229
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:57,258
A verbal vow means nothing.

230
00:10:58,378 --> 00:10:59,857
You need to write it on paper.

231
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,776
(I'll bring back evidence, or I'm willing
to be punished. Xu Chengfeng)

232
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,778
It would give Prince Yi
something against us.

233
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:17,418
His Majesty will hold us accountable.

234
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:18,737
General, you are in great trouble now.

235
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,457
And it's all for Miss Shen.

236
00:11:21,217 --> 00:11:22,217
If she loses her life

237
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:23,298
because of my absence,

238
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:24,378
I will never live in peace.

239
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:26,898
I don't want Miss Shen to become

240
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:27,857
the second Luo Ailian.

241
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:29,178
Tianhao,

242
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:30,378
later, in front of her,

243
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:31,898
don't mention a word.

244
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:34,538
Miss Shen,

245
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,778
the general brought me here in a rush.

246
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:38,457
I only brought these few antidotes.

247
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:39,938
Take one first.

248
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:41,217
It can suppress the poison for now.

249
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,817
For the final antidote,

250
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,857
I'll have to carefully prepare it
after I return.

251
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,018
Don't forget

252
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:52,697
about the poisoned jailer.

253
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:54,018
Rest assured.

254
00:11:55,538 --> 00:11:56,217
Let's go.

255
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:02,658
You can still care about someone else.

256
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:04,938
Why is it that every time I see you,

257
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:07,058
I'm always so unlucky?

258
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:09,737
I rushed over,
thinking I could be the hero who saved

259
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:10,258
the beauty.

260
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:12,058
Who knew
I would become your bane instead?

261
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:15,617
Then, thanks, my bane.

262
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:18,337
General,

263
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:21,617
I have another favor to ask of you.

264
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:23,418
Let's get out of here and then talk.

265
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:34,792
♪Destiny has set all the courses♪

266
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:37,258
Wait.

267
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,658
If you get me out now,

268
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:41,457
I'll be convicted, even if I'm innocent.

269
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:44,058
You want to leave
with your innocence proven?

270
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:45,658
Exactly.

271
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:46,817
You trust me that much.

272
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:48,018
I can't drag you down.

273
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:49,938
I'm not afraid.

274
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:50,898
What are you afraid of?

275
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:52,497
If you need anything,

276
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:53,337
just say it.

277
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:54,418
I'll do it for you.

278
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:56,298
Please find

279
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:58,258
Luo Jizhou for me.

280
00:12:58,857 --> 00:12:59,697
Finding him

281
00:13:00,018 --> 00:13:01,617
will clear my name.

282
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:03,058
He's missing?

283
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:05,817
Alive or dead,

284
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,497
as long as he is found,

285
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:10,058
the truth will come out.

286
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:11,737
Okay.

287
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,138
(Luo Residence)

288
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:17,857
(What?)

289
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:19,058
Uncle Jizhou might be alive?

290
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,258
General Xu went to the prison
to see Shen Danqing,

291
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:22,658
and he's looking for Uncle Jizhou?

292
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:23,778
Yes.

293
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:24,737
Prefect Bai said

294
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,497
General Xu might want
to get involved in this matter.

295
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:28,778
He wants all of you to be prepared.

296
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:30,778
That wench once used fireworks

297
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:32,217
to impersonate Xu Chengfeng's
signal flare.

298
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,938
I thought she heard it from gossip,

299
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:37,217
pretending to be close to General Xu.

300
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:38,298
But now it seems

301
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,577
they are indeed close.

302
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:42,857
This time,

303
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,577
she might really turn her fate around.

304
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:46,857
It's not over yet.

305
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:48,737
It's not certain who will be the winner.

306
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,817
Now that General Xu has stepped in,

307
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:52,737
it's hard for us
to deal with Shen Danqing.

308
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:54,138
But if we can find

309
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:55,898
Uncle Jizhou before General Xu does,

310
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,938
at least we can ensure our own safety.

311
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,817
Take some capable servants

312
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:05,577
to the places he often visits
to look for him.

313
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:06,497
No matter what,

314
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,298
you must find Jizhou and bring him back

315
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:09,538
before Xu Chengfeng does.

316
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:10,258
Yes.

317
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:22,658
General,

318
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:24,138
Luo Jizhou didn't go to the smugglers

319
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:25,418
who could help him leave by waterway.

320
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:29,337
It seems he has no intention
to leave the city.

321
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,097
Then where could he go?

322
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:35,298
He's still injured.
Even if he wanted to hide,

323
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:37,778
he would choose
a relatively familiar place.

324
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,898
Could he still be at the Luo Residence?

325
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,178
I've thought of a place.

326
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:44,457
Let's go have a look.

327
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:51,857
Madam.

328
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:53,217
Have you found him?

329
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:55,097
We've searched everywhere

330
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:56,538
and found nothing at all.

331
00:14:58,018 --> 00:14:58,617
Madam.

332
00:14:59,298 --> 00:14:59,857
Madam.

333
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:01,097
We couldn't find him.

334
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:05,577
No matter what,

335
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:07,258
you must find him.

336
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:08,617
Keep searching.

337
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:09,617
Yes.

338
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:11,097
Go quickly.

339
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:11,898
Act now.

340
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:12,898
Go.

341
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:16,058
Hurry.

342
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:17,617
Go ahead and take a look.

343
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:26,376
Let's go.

344
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:28,737
What's going on?

345
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:30,697
Why are the Luos chasing you?

346
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:33,617
Those venomous women

347
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:34,737
deceived me!

348
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,617
Madam Zhou kept insisting

349
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,018
that Luo Shuangshuang was my daughter.

350
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,418
But it was a lie.

351
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:41,058
When I found out the truth,

352
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:42,778
they sought to harm me.

353
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:44,938
I was lucky and got away alive.

354
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:48,898
Dead!

355
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:50,817
Murder!

356
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:51,577
Someone's dead!

357
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,938
(When I was in a daze,)

358
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,418
(I overheard everything about
how those three wicked women)

359
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,097
(twisted the truth)

360
00:15:58,217 --> 00:15:59,737
(and framed Shen Danqing.)

361
00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:00,697
(My lord,)

362
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:02,898
please stand up for me.

363
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:04,817
My lord!

364
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,138
Madam.

365
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,977
We will reward you

366
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:09,058
a lot.

367
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:10,977
Don't worry.

368
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:15,258
(I wanted to report everything
to Prefect Bai.)

369
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:16,577
(But then I heard)

370
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:19,337
that Madam Zhou
was planning to win over him.

371
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,938
I feared the two of them
would collude to harm me,

372
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:24,178
so I held my breath
and pretended to be dead.

373
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:26,217
(Later on,)

374
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,617
(I was carried into the morgue.)

375
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:31,058
(Worried about being killed
by that vile woman,)

376
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,577
(I took the chance to escape
when no one was around.)

377
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:10,537
(When I jumped)

378
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:13,178
(over yamen's surrounding wall,)

379
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,777
(I sprained my ankle.)

380
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:16,497
Since I couldn't run far

381
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,737
and feared another mishap,

382
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:19,217
I changed clothes with someone

383
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:21,898
and planned to flee to another mansion
under the cover of night.

384
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:23,457
But unexpectedly,

385
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:24,697
they pursued me here.

386
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,338
If it weren't for you,

387
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,017
I couldn't imagine

388
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,497
what they would do to me.

389
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,178
From what you just said,

390
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:33,217
all these crimes

391
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:34,697
were committed by Luo Shuangshuang,

392
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:36,057
Ms. Zhou, and Luo Xue'er.

393
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:38,138
And they have nothing to do
with Shen Danqing.

394
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:39,017
That's right.

395
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:41,898
General,

396
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:43,777
you must uphold justice for me.

397
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:46,338
Get up first.

398
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:50,217
Rest assured.

399
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:52,017
If what you say is true,

400
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:53,737
I'll see that justice is served for you.

401
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:55,858
Thank you, General.

402
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:06,632
Mother,

403
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:08,098
why is there still no news?

404
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:09,457
Send someone to ask again.

405
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:10,658
If there's news,

406
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:11,818
the servants will report it to us

407
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:12,938
immediately.

408
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:16,057
Madam.

409
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:16,977
You found him?

410
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:19,017
Mr. Tianhao from the General's Mansion

411
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:20,497
has surrounded our residence
with guards.

412
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:23,017
They say that Madam
and the two young ladies

413
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:23,898
must go to the yamen

414
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:26,418
to review the case of Shen Danqing.

415
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,017
You may leave.

416
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:30,378
Yes.

417
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:31,898
The general has sent guards over?

418
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,537
How could this happen?

419
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:34,977
General Xu

420
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:37,017
is actually going to stand up
for Shen Danqing.

421
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:39,737
It seems we can't quiet it down anymore.

422
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:41,618
We must prepare for the worst.

423
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:43,378
The worst?

424
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:45,098
What does that mean?

425
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:48,658
I'm afraid Xu Chengfeng

426
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:50,658
has already found Luo Jizhou.

427
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:54,977
I fear the prospects are truly grim.

428
00:18:57,938 --> 00:18:58,697
Mother,

429
00:18:59,017 --> 00:18:59,938
is there really

430
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,418
no room for maneuvering left?

431
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,858
I don't want to go back to jail.

432
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:09,818
I don't want to be in that cell again.

433
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:11,457
That place

434
00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:12,618
is dark and stinky.

435
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,418
And at night, it's crawling with bugs.

436
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:17,858
Don't think too much yet.

437
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,858
We'll act as circumstances dictate.

438
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:22,737
I will definitely protect you.

439
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:23,578
Remember,

440
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:26,257
just insist that you
haven't killed your uncle.

441
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:27,217
I'll take care

442
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:28,338
of the rest.

443
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:30,257
There will certainly be a way.

444
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:35,217
Okay.

445
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:39,378
(How are you?)

446
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:40,338
Do you feel uncomfortable?

447
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:42,338
I'm fine now.

448
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:44,777
Don't you trust Mr. Miao's
medical skills?

449
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:46,057
I've already taken the antidote.

450
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:47,537
(Prison)
After resting for a night,

451
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:48,977
the poison
should have been fully lifted.

452
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:50,537
But it damaged your body after all.

453
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,938
So it's better to be careful.

454
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:54,697
Mr. Miao told me about what happened.

455
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:56,098
I didn't expect

456
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:57,818
that General Xu would help us.

457
00:19:58,537 --> 00:19:59,818
He investigated me

458
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:01,178
because he thought
I was a female bandit.

459
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,777
He was fulfilling his duty.

460
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:03,898
Now he has saved me

461
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:05,098
and is willing to hold a retrial.

462
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:06,777
It's due to his righteousness.

463
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:08,178
He is a person worthy of trust.

464
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:10,088
It's my fault.

465
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:11,338
I didn't expect Luo Jizhou

466
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:12,578
to have someone wear his clothes.

467
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:15,057
By the time I realized it,
it was already too late.

468
00:20:15,618 --> 00:20:16,138
Zishan,

469
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:17,378
don't blame yourself.

470
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:18,697
How would you know Luo Xue'er

471
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:19,977
would act so viciously?

472
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:21,658
But rest assured.

473
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:22,697
Soon,

474
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:25,017
we will be able to see those people

475
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:26,338
attacking each other,

476
00:20:26,777 --> 00:20:27,858
bringing about their own doom.

477
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,098
(Liao City Yamen)

478
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:34,618
General Xu.

479
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:36,178
Prefect Bai,

480
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:38,338
last night, I obtained

481
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,578
a very important piece of evidence.

482
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:42,618
Now, all the parties involved

483
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,658
in this case are present.

484
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:45,737
I'll hand the evidence over to you

485
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:47,578
and let you conduct a retrial.

486
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:48,977
I hope this time

487
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:50,737
you can judge the case fairly.

488
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,257
Okay.

489
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:00,138
Bring him in.

490
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:10,056
You...

491
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:12,017
Weren't you dead?

492
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:14,098
Thanks to General Xu,

493
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:18,297
I am alive.

494
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:21,017
Madam Zhou,

495
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:23,098
how come you show no hint of joy
seeing me here?

496
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:25,217
Aren't you happy

497
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:26,858
that I survived?

498
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:27,858
Happy?

499
00:21:28,257 --> 00:21:30,098
I wish you were torn into pieces.

500
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:36,697
I admit

501
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:39,537
to the attempted murder of Luo Jizhou.

502
00:21:43,297 --> 00:21:44,138
Ms. Zhou,

503
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:46,457
do you realize
that you just admitted a crime?

504
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:48,378
I can

505
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:49,737
put you in prison for that.

506
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:51,178
I confess.

507
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:52,418
But at the same time,

508
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:54,977
I want to accuse Luo Jizhou

509
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:56,658
of raping me.

510
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,537
You!

511
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:00,418
(They've started to attack each other,
as expected.)

512
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,658
What raping?

513
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:03,578
It was you who seduced me first.

514
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:04,418
You...!

515
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:05,457
I seduced you?

516
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,378
Was it me
who drunkenly ran to your room?

517
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:10,898
Was it me who held you down so tightly

518
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:11,858
that you couldn't get away?

519
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:15,618
Was it me who repeatedly said
I wanted to compensate you?

520
00:22:16,497 --> 00:22:18,938
Luo Jizhou, you don't dare
admit what you did.

521
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:20,457
You're not a real man.

522
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:23,497
To protect the reputation
of the Luo family and myself,

523
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:24,898
I could only suffer in silence.

524
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:26,497
For all these years,

525
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:28,257
I've made my boundaries clear with him.

526
00:22:28,658 --> 00:22:30,537
Yet after the death of my husband,

527
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,858
he intended to have me once again.

528
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:33,457
And he said

529
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:34,088
he would

530
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:37,098
drive my daughter and me out
if I didn't comply.

531
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,737
I had no choice but to act first

532
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:42,057
for self-protection.

533
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:44,418
Nonsense!

534
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:45,138
My lord.

535
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:45,697
Nonsense?

536
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,280
She...

537
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,497
I was only 19
when I married into the Luo family.

538
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:50,138
And even though I was just a concubine,

539
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:52,578
I hoped to be a good wife and mother

540
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:53,858
and live a peaceful life.

541
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:55,818
But all this

542
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:57,858
has been ruined by you, you scoundrel!

543
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,898
You've destroyed
the first half of my life,

544
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:03,418
and now you want
to destroy the rest of it!

545
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:05,578
Luo Jizhou,

546
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:08,178
give me back the life that I deserve!

547
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:13,138
Mother!

548
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:17,537
Luo Jizhou,

549
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:19,697
you survived at Zuiyun Tower.

550
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:21,777
But today, I'll make sure
you go down with me.

551
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:22,737
What are you doing?

552
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:23,697
Luo Jizhou,

553
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:24,898
I will kill you!

554
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:26,858
I will kill you, Luo Jizhou!

555
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:28,138
Luo Jizhou,

556
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:30,898
I will kill you!

557
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:31,938
(That's bad.)

558
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:33,537
(She has made up her mind)

559
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:34,977
(to take the blame for her daughters)

560
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:36,178
(at the cost of killing someone.)

561
00:23:36,178 --> 00:23:37,898
Quickly take him away for treatment.

562
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:44,977
How dare you!

563
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:47,537
You intended to commit murder in court!

564
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:49,578
I am the one who hit Luo Jizhou.

565
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:52,898
I am also the one
who framed Shen Danqing.

566
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,418
Although I was forced,

567
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:57,138
I admit to it all.

568
00:23:57,777 --> 00:23:58,697
General Xu,

569
00:23:59,138 --> 00:23:59,938
Prefect Bai,

570
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:02,818
if you must arrest someone, arrest me.

571
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:03,816
Mother!

572
00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:04,618
What are you...

573
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:05,938
Everything was done by me alone.

574
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:07,898
It has nothing to do with them.

575
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:09,297
Mother!

576
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:11,338
I'll take responsibility
for my own actions.

577
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:14,777
My whole life

578
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:17,017
has been thoroughly wretched.

579
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:19,497
If you have pity on me,

580
00:24:20,578 --> 00:24:21,818
grant me a quick end.

581
00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:23,618
Just kill me.

582
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:31,658
Ms. Zhou,

583
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,457
Luo Jizhou had only
suffered minor injuries.

584
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:36,858
Even if he accused you,
it wouldn't warrant your death.

585
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,378
However, just now, in court,

586
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:42,098
you committed murder
in front of everyone.

587
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:43,898
According to the laws of Dafeng,

588
00:24:44,378 --> 00:24:45,578
you will be executed.

589
00:24:46,297 --> 00:24:47,338
Being able to kill Luo Jizhou,

590
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:49,858
I'd accept even the death penalty.

591
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:52,818
Today, I merely did something

592
00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:54,818
that I've always wanted to do deep down.

593
00:24:54,818 --> 00:24:55,777
I only feel relieved,

594
00:24:57,378 --> 00:24:58,457
not guilty.

595
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,217
Shuangshuang.

596
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:05,537
Xue'er.

597
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,378
In my entire life,

598
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,457
I have no other hopes

599
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,138
except wishing you to live well.

600
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,418
It's really interesting.

601
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:21,418
Having committed murder,

602
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:23,338
yet here you are playing the victim,

603
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:24,618
complaining about your grievances.

604
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:26,697
Ms. Zhou,

605
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,777
how did you end up like this

606
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:30,658
after all these years?

607
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,737
That's because I have bad luck.

608
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:34,777
Bad luck?

609
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:36,898
I think it's because
you have a malicious heart.

610
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:38,257
You're unworthy of love and care.

611
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:40,497
Do you think

612
00:25:41,578 --> 00:25:43,057
it will be all over
if you take the blame

613
00:25:44,497 --> 00:25:45,697
for the real culprit?

614
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:50,618
Well, the truth is,

615
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,497
karma goes full circle.

616
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:54,777
Neither of

617
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:56,697
your good daughters

618
00:25:57,297 --> 00:25:58,777
will end well.

619
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:00,777
I've committed a crime.

620
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:03,537
But my daughters are innocent.

621
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:07,217
I won't tolerate your groundless slander
and curse on them.

622
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:11,658
General Xu

623
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:13,017
and Prefect Bai,

624
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,697
Luo Jizhou has suffered
a severe head injury

625
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:16,658
and is now unconscious.

626
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:18,938
The physician said
that even if he awakens,

627
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:20,938
his brain may not recover.

628
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,138
Well...

629
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,178
Ms. Zhou attempted to murder her kin.

630
00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:31,178
According to the laws of Dafeng,
she is sentenced to death.

631
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:34,378
She will be executed
once the case is reviewed in the autumn.

632
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:37,257
Since the real culprit has surrendered,

633
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:40,457
Shen Danqing,
Luo Shuangshuang, and Luo Xue'er

634
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:41,418
have nothing to do

635
00:26:41,418 --> 00:26:42,537
with the murder of Luo Jizhou.

636
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:44,457
They are free to go.

637
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:46,697
Take Zhou away.

638
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:47,208
Yes.

639
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:47,816
Yes.

640
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:50,938
No!

641
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:52,178
Don't!

642
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:53,418
Mother!

643
00:26:54,297 --> 00:26:55,418
Mother!

644
00:26:57,257 --> 00:26:58,098
Mother!

645
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:00,178
Mother!

646
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:07,178
Prefect Bai.

647
00:27:12,217 --> 00:27:12,938
Yes?

648
00:27:12,938 --> 00:27:13,618
Prefect Bai,

649
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:15,418
you've neglected your duty.

650
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:17,858
You lost the most important corpse

651
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:19,418
and hastily concluded the case.

652
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:21,257
Are you aware

653
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:23,658
that Shen Danqing was nearly poisoned
to death in the cell?

654
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:25,938
If it weren't
for my timely intervention,

655
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:27,257
you'd have implicated another life.

656
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:28,737
Do you acknowledge it?

657
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:30,418
I'm guilty.

658
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:34,378
I'll apologize to Miss Shen.

659
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:36,017
You've acknowledged it.

660
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:37,497
So I'll not punish you severely.

661
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:39,178
What punishment

662
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:39,858
should you take?

663
00:27:40,898 --> 00:27:41,697
Well.

664
00:27:44,138 --> 00:27:46,257
A fine of one year's salary?

665
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:47,537
Plus twenty hefty floggings

666
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:48,898
as a warning to others.

667
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:50,697
Thank you, General.

668
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:13,064
(Liao City Yamen)

669
00:28:24,977 --> 00:28:26,537
Although we didn't bring them all down,

670
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:28,777
at least Zhou,
who set the fire back then,

671
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:30,138
and her accomplice Luo Jizhou

672
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:31,338
have received their due punishment.

673
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:33,138
They are utterly evil.

674
00:28:34,098 --> 00:28:35,418
Even Heaven cannot tolerate

675
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:36,737
the crimes they committed.

676
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:37,977
Let alone me.

677
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:39,977
Now,

678
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:41,658
only Luo Xue'er remains.

679
00:28:42,297 --> 00:28:43,378
She's cunning at heart.

680
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:45,697
Her ambition and desire won't stop here.

681
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:47,338
I'll see to it that she watches

682
00:28:47,338 --> 00:28:48,777
everything she's ever gained

683
00:28:49,297 --> 00:28:50,818
vanish before her very eyes,

684
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:52,098
helplessly.

685
00:28:53,217 --> 00:28:54,057
Rest assured.

686
00:28:54,057 --> 00:28:55,057
No matter what you do,

687
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:56,338
I will support you.

688
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:57,138
Mmm.

689
00:28:57,898 --> 00:28:58,457
Let's go.

690
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:03,178
Little trinkets!

691
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:05,257
Come take a look!

692
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,217
(Zuiyun Tower)
This way.

693
00:29:06,697 --> 00:29:07,217
Okay.

694
00:29:07,217 --> 00:29:08,977
Come and have a look!

695
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:17,017
You said you wanted me to meet someone.

696
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:18,138
So it's him.

697
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:19,777
What's going on here?

698
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:21,618
I only know Miss Shen

699
00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:23,338
said she wanted to thank me
for saving her.

700
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:26,697
I thought today
would be a romantic occasion

701
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:27,497
with a pretty lady.

702
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:29,858
I didn't know you'd bring him along.

703
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:31,497
Let's find out

704
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:33,217
what she is up to.

705
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:35,777
Perhaps we should sit down and talk.

706
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:37,697
Sure.

707
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,257
Then I'll be blunt with you.

708
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:52,138
General Xu, you gave me a hard time.

709
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:53,737
You even threw me into the water.

710
00:29:54,138 --> 00:29:55,098
On the surface,

711
00:29:55,098 --> 00:29:57,098
you treated me as a female bandit
who robbed the grain.

712
00:29:57,777 --> 00:29:59,898
How could a mere female bandit

713
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:02,618
bring forth a high-ranking general
in charge of defense?

714
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:04,138
I think there must be

715
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:05,418
a bigger conspiracy behind this.

716
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,297
And it might be related

717
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:08,898
to the purpose
of your visit to Liao City.

718
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:12,658
You know the purpose

719
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:13,818
of my visit to Liao City?

720
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:17,737
On the day we caught
the real female bandit together...

721
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:19,898
Tianhao,

722
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:22,257
go check out the trap over there.

723
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:23,336
Okay.

724
00:30:25,618 --> 00:30:26,578
I will go with you.

725
00:30:26,578 --> 00:30:27,257
No need.

726
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:29,378
(I wanted to go and check with you.)

727
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,152
Be careful.

728
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:31,378
(But you told me to stay put.)

729
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:33,497
Rest here for now.
I'll go and have a look.

730
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:36,457
(Although I had a foot injury,)

731
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:37,818
(I was not immobilized.)

732
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:40,217
(You were hiding something from me.)

733
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:42,777
Yet in that mere lair of a few bandits,

734
00:30:43,138 --> 00:30:46,138
apart from some stolen treasures,

735
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:48,578
what else was there
that you needed to hide from me?

736
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:50,578
By linking all those together,

737
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:51,898
I have a bold idea.

738
00:30:52,537 --> 00:30:54,138
Your investigation may be related

739
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:57,017
to the imperial cargo
that the Shen family lost earlier.

740
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:01,098
I didn't expect

741
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:03,697
you to be so good at reading minds.

742
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:05,497
Then why don't you tell me

743
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:07,618
what I am thinking right now?

744
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:10,257
I'm not good at reading minds.

745
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:12,578
I merely linked minor details together

746
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,297
and came up with a conclusion.

747
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:17,178
As for what you're thinking right now...

748
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:20,777
Well, your investigation
must have encountered difficulties.

749
00:31:21,098 --> 00:31:22,017
Otherwise,

750
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:23,858
you would have found out the truth

751
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,217
and left Liao City already.

752
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:27,240
Zishan,

753
00:31:27,858 --> 00:31:29,178
how did I not notice before

754
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,017
that your sister is so clever

755
00:31:31,178 --> 00:31:31,977
and deft?

756
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,898
She is my sister, after all.

757
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:35,297
Of course, she's extraordinary.

758
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:37,448
Zishan,

759
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:38,658
I called you over today

760
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:40,697
because I hope that you two
can make things clear.

761
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:43,378
General Xu wants to find out

762
00:31:43,578 --> 00:31:45,537
the truth behind the theft of our cargo.

763
00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:46,497
And you

764
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:49,618
have always wanted to find out
who poisoned me.

765
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:51,057
On second thought,

766
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:53,098
the timing of my poisoning
is very coincidental.

767
00:31:53,697 --> 00:31:56,017
Someone must have poisoned me on purpose

768
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,497
to lure you away

769
00:31:57,898 --> 00:31:58,737
so as to steal the cargo.

770
00:31:59,257 --> 00:31:59,977
Therefore,

771
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:01,818
I believe your objectives are aligned.

772
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:03,418
That's true.

773
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:05,618
Your poisoning
is by no means accidental.

774
00:32:06,697 --> 00:32:07,457
Zishan,

775
00:32:07,818 --> 00:32:10,057
I think we should be honest
with each other

776
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,178
and cooperate.

777
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:13,818
About this,

778
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:17,378
I never thought about
asking others for help.

779
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:21,378
But you are not just anyone.

780
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,338
We trained together for three years.

781
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,138
I am willing to trust you.

782
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:29,098
That's great.

783
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:30,457
If you two collaborate,

784
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:32,217
the truth will certainly come to light.

785
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,818
But since this case involves my family,

786
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:36,057
there can be no mistakes.

787
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:37,818
I've recorded everything that happened

788
00:32:37,818 --> 00:32:39,818
at that time
and the clues I've found afterwards

789
00:32:40,098 --> 00:32:41,138
in my diary.

790
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:42,497
I'll give it to you later.

791
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:44,537
I hope it will aid
in your investigation.

792
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:47,098
Zishan,

793
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:48,578
rest assured.

794
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:50,418
I will do my utmost

795
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:51,880
to not let you

796
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:53,898
and your sister down.

797
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:55,217
Come on.

798
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:12,658
Well, Xu Chengfeng.

799
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:14,057
You're finally back.

800
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:18,098
I didn't expect you
to wait for me till now.

801
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:20,737
I feel terribly sorry.

802
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,737
You've neglected your duties

803
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,418
and defied the imperial edict.

804
00:33:25,977 --> 00:33:27,537
Before you left, you said

805
00:33:28,497 --> 00:33:29,618
if you brought back no evidence,

806
00:33:29,938 --> 00:33:30,977
you'd return to the capital

807
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:33,257
with me to be questioned
and punished by His Majesty.

808
00:33:34,378 --> 00:33:35,898
So this is what you were talking about.

809
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,257
However, this time,

810
00:33:39,257 --> 00:33:40,497
I indeed made some gains.

811
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,338
I even obtained some insider clues.

812
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:44,977
I'm afraid your accusation of me

813
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:46,938
neglecting my duties was wrong.

814
00:33:47,178 --> 00:33:48,178
What clues did you get?

815
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:49,658
Show me.

816
00:33:57,338 --> 00:33:57,938
Tianhao,

817
00:33:57,977 --> 00:33:59,217
deliver this to the minister directly

818
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:00,618
to report to His Majesty.

819
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:02,216
Okay.

820
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,778
You are not deceiving me

821
00:34:09,657 --> 00:34:11,657
by claiming a blank notebook
as evidence, right?

822
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,258
I don't have the audacity to do so.

823
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:19,938
Even if I can fool you now,

824
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:23,457
I won't be able to explain it
to His Majesty and the minister later.

825
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:25,818
Through expedited delivery,

826
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:27,497
within a day and a night,

827
00:34:27,938 --> 00:34:30,898
the diary will be delivered
to the minister and His Majesty.

828
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:33,177
Whether the evidence
they receive is real or fake

829
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:34,497
will be revealed to you,

830
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:35,818
as you have eyes everywhere.

831
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:38,344
Alright then.

832
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:40,858
Well done, General Xu.

833
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:43,298
To reward you,

834
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:45,057
I have a gift.

835
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:47,537
You flatter me.

836
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:48,938
A gift from you

837
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:50,338
is more than I can take.

838
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,898
But you have obtained exclusive clues.

839
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:54,657
This is a great merit.

840
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,617
I simply cannot bear
to see you overworked.

841
00:34:58,177 --> 00:34:59,338
The gift I am giving you

842
00:34:59,617 --> 00:35:00,977
is to alleviate your worries.

843
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:02,338
Come in.

844
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:11,457
I'm Lv Zhu.

845
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,938
Greetings, General Xu.

846
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:16,338
She is Lv Zhu, the personal maid
I've prepared

847
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:17,097
for you.

848
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:19,977
Your Highness,

849
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:23,617
I have lived in the military camp
for a long time

850
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:25,698
and am used to the rough life.

851
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:28,418
With Tianhao taking care of me,

852
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:29,898
that is enough.

853
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:33,258
You don't want her?

854
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:35,577
No.

855
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:42,818
Since you don't like Lv Zhu...

856
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:44,938
Guards!

857
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:47,457
Take Lv Zhu out and execute her.

858
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:48,338
Yes!

859
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:49,738
Stop!

860
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,657
Why are you doing this?

861
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:57,177
She is a gift for you.

862
00:35:57,858 --> 00:35:59,298
But obviously, you don't like her.

863
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:01,537
A gift that has been rejected

864
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:04,617
has no value anymore.

865
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:08,057
General!

866
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:12,040
Fine.

867
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:14,298
It's a life, after all.

868
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:16,497
I will keep her.

869
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:17,657
Very well, then.

870
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:19,938
Lv Zhu,

871
00:36:20,617 --> 00:36:21,898
take good care of General Xu.

872
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:06,818
You will live here from now on.

873
00:37:08,418 --> 00:37:09,898
Do not wander
around the mansion at will.

874
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:14,577
What are you doing?

875
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:15,898
Don't touch me.

876
00:37:16,378 --> 00:37:19,177
This place is dark, secluded, and dirty.

877
00:37:19,898 --> 00:37:22,017
I am a bit scared.

878
00:37:22,418 --> 00:37:22,920
Scared of what?

879
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:24,537
With General Xu around, this mansion

880
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:26,097
is the safest place in Liao City.

881
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:28,617
Then

882
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:30,418
what's your name?

883
00:37:30,778 --> 00:37:31,858
Just call me Tianhao.

884
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:35,537
General Tianhao.

885
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:36,858
Well,

886
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:39,418
you look so handsome.

887
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:42,457
You must have a very kind heart.

888
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:45,258
Could you do me a favor

889
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:48,497
and arrange for me a room
with a livelier ambiance?

890
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:50,537
Like I said, it's inappropriate...

891
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:51,898
My answer is no.

892
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:52,738
No?

893
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:54,218
There aren't many vacant rooms here.

894
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:55,418
Be thankful that you have a room.

895
00:37:55,537 --> 00:37:56,057
Don't be picky.

896
00:37:57,698 --> 00:37:58,657
Then where do you live?

897
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,378
I am the general's personal guard.

898
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:02,258
Of course, I live to the left
of his bedroom.

899
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:05,738
As the general's personal guard,

900
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:07,657
you live to the left of his bedroom.

901
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:09,738
Then, as his personal maid,

902
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:12,378
I should share a room with him.

903
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,977
(So this is what she's up to.)

904
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:18,017
You have a point.

905
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:23,378
But

906
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:26,977
the general sleepwalks
and practices swordsmanship

907
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:28,497
at night.

908
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:30,218
You are too slow.

909
00:38:30,218 --> 00:38:31,057
You know no martial arts.

910
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:32,258
With one strike from him,

911
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,177
you will be dead.

912
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:34,818
General Tianhao,

913
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:36,057
you scared me!

914
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:39,378
You are so weird.

915
00:38:41,577 --> 00:38:42,218
Let go of me.

916
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,432
Tianhao!

917
00:38:43,432 --> 00:38:44,177
Let go!

918
00:38:44,177 --> 00:38:44,818
Don't go.

919
00:38:44,818 --> 00:38:45,320
Let go!

920
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,992
It's inappropriate.

921
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,080
Get some rest.

922
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:47,752
And behave.

923
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:48,296
Tianhao,

924
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,617
don't leave me alone.

925
00:38:57,457 --> 00:38:58,898
Such a blockhead.

926
00:38:58,898 --> 00:38:59,938
Stone heart.

927
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:01,778
I'll let you off today.

928
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:03,617
Let's wait and see.

929
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:12,258
That woman is real trouble.

930
00:39:17,818 --> 00:39:20,017
But she called me General Tianhao.

931
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:23,617
General?

932
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:26,858
No one has ever called me that before.

933
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:30,017
General Tianhao.

934
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:35,457
So cool.

935
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:39,112
General.

936
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:41,097
What are you grinning about?

937
00:39:43,938 --> 00:39:45,577
I've already arranged for Lv Zhu to stay

938
00:39:45,577 --> 00:39:46,457
in the most remote room.

939
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:47,497
That's not necessary.

940
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:50,177
Just have her serve close by tomorrow.

941
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:52,338
She is the secret agent

942
00:39:52,497 --> 00:39:53,898
Prince Yi's planted by your side.

943
00:39:54,378 --> 00:39:55,017
Secret agent?

944
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:56,657
Isn't she an overt agent?

945
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,778
Then why will you allow her
to serve close by?

946
00:39:59,457 --> 00:40:00,218
I think

947
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:01,738
we should take the chance

948
00:40:01,738 --> 00:40:02,738
to find a fault

949
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:03,977
and drive her away.

950
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,177
Silly you.

951
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,738
If we handle Lv Zhu carelessly,

952
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:10,457
we will fall for Prince Yi's trick.

953
00:40:10,738 --> 00:40:12,577
And then he could
make a big fuss out of it.

954
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,497
Even if we drive Lv Zhu away today,

955
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:16,577
he could send another tomorrow.

956
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:19,778
So, what should we do?

957
00:40:20,057 --> 00:40:20,818
We do nothing.

958
00:40:21,577 --> 00:40:22,657
Prince Yi can act as he likes.

959
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:24,338
