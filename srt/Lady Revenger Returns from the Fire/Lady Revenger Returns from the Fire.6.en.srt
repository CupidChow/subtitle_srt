00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,920
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,181
Young Master, someone has been
tailing us all the way.

4
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:32,060
I know.

5
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,140
But he never made a move along the way.

6
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,661
I wonder what he's up to.

7
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,741
We might as well ask him
rather than guess.

8
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:49,140
Excuse me, why don't you
come out and rest instead of

9
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,181
skulking in the bushes?

10
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,700
(Piaoxiang Tavern)
You are Xu Chengfeng's deputy general.

11
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,860
Did he send you to follow us?

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,860
The general sent me to protect you
lest there are bandits.

13
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,541
To protect me or to monitor me?

14
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:20,020
So many mosquitoes.

15
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,620
Where is Xu Chengfeng?
Why didn't he come with you?

16
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:27,661
He must be picking on Danqing again.

17
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:31,140
Mr. Qin, take good care of the cargo.
I leave it in your hands.

18
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,981
Young Master Shen, don't...

19
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:33,541
Stay put.

20
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,981
Giddy-up.

21
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,620
Please don't go. I swear the general
didn't go to see Miss Shen.

22
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,020
Painting the scenery for fun,
you are in a good mood, Miss Shen.

23
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:03,941
Why are you here, spying on me?

24
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:05,460
It was not my intention.

25
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,821
I was simply captivated by
the great scenery and the fine work.

26
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,821
What a pity. It was so peaceful
with singing birds and fragrant flowers.

27
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,020
But someone had to intrude
and ruin the moment.

28
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,620
Forget it, I'm going home.
General, suit yourself.

29
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,381
Miss Shen, just a second.

30
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,821
I came to see you
because I have a few words to say.

31
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,981
We don't know each other well.
What's there to say?

32
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,101
You don't even know why I'm here.

33
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:36,341
What makes you say that?

34
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:41,140
I still remember
how you forced me to pour tea.

35
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,180
People with different principles
don't get along.

36
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:46,061
You seem to hold quite a grudge.

37
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:50,221
Exactly, I always keep account
and seek retribution.

38
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,261
What do you want?

39
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,381
Miss Shen, do you have such shoes?

40
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,717
Yes.

41
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,221
You are quite honest.

42
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:10,981
You enjoy pushing people,
so I must be honest.

43
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:13,261
Otherwise, when will I go home?

44
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:15,261
Where were you last night?

45
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:19,021
Naturally, I was in my room, sleeping.

46
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:20,260
Can anyone testify to that?

47
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,781
Ridiculous. I was all alone.
Who could testify for me?

48
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,141
Since no one can testify,

49
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,117
does it mean that

50
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:30,189
you're the female bandit
I'm looking for?

51
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:42,157
You finally looked at me in the eye.

52
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:51,213
The eyes best reveal
a person's true thoughts.

53
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:53,260
You dare not look me in the eye.

54
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,781
How do I know
if you're telling the truth?

55
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,860
I am telling the truth.

56
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,221
Then prove it.

57
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:05,380
Ridiculous. I'm not a female bandit.
How can I prove it to you?

58
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,021
What are you doing? Let go.

59
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,260
Miss Shen, can you swim?

60
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,380
No.

61
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,620
Lying will get you punished.

62
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm not lying. Let go of me.

63
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,060
You know I like to push people.
Now tell the truth.

64
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,661
(He wants to see if I will
expose myself at the critical moment.)

65
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,300
(The real Shen Danqing can't swim.
I can't be caught lying.)

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,101
I am telling the truth. Let go of me!

67
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,420
(People can only hold their breath
for a while. She will blow it.)

68
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,461
(Since it's a battle of wits,
I have to be tougher than you.)

69
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,380
(I bet you won't really kill me.
It's just a test.)

70
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,620
(I'll hang in there.)

71
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,740
(Still not coming up?
Is she really in trouble?)

72
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,141
Giddy-up! Stop!

73
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,101
Xu Chengfeng, where is my sister?

74
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,060
You threw her into the water?

75
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,485
Didn't I tell you she can't swim?

76
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:01,260
Zishan, I'm keeping time.
She won't be in any danger.

77
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
Get out of my way.

78
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:09,260
She's scared of water
because she nearly drowned once.

79
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,221
I'll kill you
if anything happens to her.

80
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,500
Do you want to argue more
or let me save your sister?

81
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,820
(Is that Zishan? He's come to save me.)

82
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,581
Danqing, are you okay?

83
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,300
Zishan, how come you're here?

84
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,341
Don't worry.
I won't let anyone hurt you.

85
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:02,101
General, do you still suspect
that I am a female bandit?

86
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:07,101
General Xu, my sister's life
was at stake.

87
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:10,029
If she could swim,
she wouldn't have let herself drown.

88
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,781
Find evidence if you still have doubts.

89
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,940
Otherwise, I will not spare you
if you do this again.

90
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,021
(I know you put on an act
for Xu Chengfeng.)

91
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,860
But do you know how dangerous that was?

92
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,581
Stop your plans for revenge.

93
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:33,020
I don't know what might happen next.

94
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,061
I am worried about you.

95
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:38,900
Zishan, I know you are worried about me.

96
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,461
Mr. Miao told me that you
rushed back overnight once you heard

97
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:46,581
your sister was in trouble
while you were escorting the cargo.

98
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,380
You lost the cargo.

99
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,341
And you have been haunted
by it ever since.

100
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,301
But you made the same choice

101
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:57,701
when you heard I might be in trouble.

102
00:08:57,701 --> 00:09:01,421
As long as you are still Shen Danqing,
I won't let you face danger alone.

103
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:04,620
You've only dealt with him twice
and you almost died.

104
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,780
Luck can't always be by your side.

105
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,061
But luck brought me here
and made me your sister.

106
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,461
You think I'll die, seeking revenge.

107
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:14,020
But I would have given up

108
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,821
the first time I was in danger
if I didn't want to take revenge.

109
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:19,140
You can stay away from danger
once you give up.

110
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,540
You have become Shen Danqing.

111
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,701
You have a family and a peaceful life.

112
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:25,821
Compared to these,
is revenge really that important?

113
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:37,780
Between the lines

114
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:42,701
of that diary you gave me, I can see
your wholehearted love for your sister.

115
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:47,941
Mr. Miao said your sister
was poisoned to death.

116
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,101
You've never given up investigating.

117
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,341
Don't you want revenge
if you find the murderer?

118
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:57,181
But you're putting your life
at stake for revenge.

119
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,740
Why insist on this?

120
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,101
That's right, others may not understand.

121
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,780
But I thought you would know the pain
that gnaws at the heart.

122
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,020
If not for these villains,

123
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:14,421
I would still be happy
and carefree with my family.

124
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:20,500
But they took away my loved ones.
They took away everything.

125
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:22,981
Shouldn't they pay for this?

126
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:27,469
♪One thought goes up
as another goes down♪

127
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:32,701
You gave me a second life.

128

Take it back if you want me
to stop seeking revenge.

129

♪With unrepentant persistence♪

130
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,660

♪Which protects you as it protects me♪

132
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,140
I heard about what happened today.

133
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:10,740
You're always against her revenge plan.

134
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,260
Do you regret letting her
take Danqing's place?

135
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,421
She asked me a question today.

136
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,421
If I knew who killed my sister,

137
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,301
would I let them go?

138
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:31,740
We share something
in common. So I can relate.

139
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,461
Indeed.

140
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:36,581
Her handing me the dagger
is like entrusting her life to me.

141
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,101
She trusts me so much,
and I'm also willing to trust her.

142
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:56,660
General, have some
lotus seed tea to warm up.

143
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:02,181
It's alright. I wonder
how Miss Shen is doing right now.

144
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,140
By the way, Tianhao,
what do you think of Miss Shen?

145
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:15,660
Nobody would
put himself in grave danger.

146
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,181
Those who can swim can't hide their
instinctive moves underwater, but...

147
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,780
But what?

148
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
But Miss Shen is nothing ordinary.

149
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,181
She's crafty and cunning,
and hard to fathom.

150
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:30,061
Hard to fathom.

151
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:36,260
It's like she has
all the tricks up her sleeve.

152
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:45,341
Tianhao, a tea leaf slowly unfolds
in the water to show its true color.

153
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,500
But a lotus seed is different.

154
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,461
It may look pure and sweet,

155
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:55,620
but it's very tough.

156
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,301
No matter how long it's soaked in water,
it won't reveal its nature.

157
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,380
We just don't know if Shen Danqing
is a tea leaf or a lotus seed.

158
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:10,701
She can be a tea leaf or a lotus seed.

159
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:13,821
I'm sure you'll reveal her true color.

160
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,181
I'm looking forward

161
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,740
to her new tricks
if she is the one I'm looking for.

162
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,821
Uncle, could you tell us everything
that happened with the bandits?

163
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,821
The caravan
passed through the small woods

164
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:31,620
and a group of bandits rushed out.

165
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,740
The leader was a woman.

166
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,540
Do you remember what she looked like?

167
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,941
She was wearing a mask.
So I didn't see her well.

168
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,061
What about her stature,
hairstyle, and adornments?

169
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:49,900
Medium stature. A short top.

170
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,221
Red belt. I didn't see any ornaments.

171
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,941
She had a topknot bun.

172
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:57,380
A topknot bun?

173
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:02,740
Uncle, are you sure she had a bun
on top of her head?

174
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,581
Yeah, on top of her head.

175
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,101
Mother.

176
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,740
Xue'er, you are as attentive as ever.

177
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,900
It's sufficient to prove
Shuangshuang's innocence.

178
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,181
What do you mean by that?

179
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:19,380
Shuangshuang

180
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:24,620
once learned to curl her hair with tongs
heated over a charcoal brazier

181
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,581
when she was young.

182
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:29,540
But she burnt the scalp
on the back of her head

183
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,181
and left a scar
the size of a finger there.

184
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:34,221
No hair would grow on that spot.

185
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:38,445
That's right, Shuangshuang
always covers it with a bun.

186
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:42,221
She would never tie a topknot bun.

187
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,941
Mother, I will organize the evidence
and report to the general tomorrow.

188
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,500
Go ahead.

189
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:59,740
Xue'er is so meticulous
and level-headed in her actions.

190
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,221
It would be best
if she could truly side with us.

191
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,701
If Xue'er really
saves Shuangshuang this time,

192
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,260
it's like passing the test.

193
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,421
(General's Mansion)
(General Xu, here are the testimonies)

194
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:20,341
on the female bandit
from Madam Zhou and Master Jizhou.

195
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,461
It shows that Shuangshuang would never
tie a topknot bun to reveal her scar.

196
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:28,620
It's enough to prove that she is not
that bandit. Please do her justice.

197
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,860
I will certainly look into it
and do you justice.

198
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,140
Thank you.

199
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:41,453
(Testimony of Luo Jizhou)
No hair ornaments.

200
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:45,553
Only a simple topknot
on top of her head.

201
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:51,301
No hair ornaments, topknot bun.

202
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,620
Shen Danqing, it's you again.

203
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:10,020
The northeast suburbs?
Why does he want me there?

204
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,101
The general says
you are exceptionally intelligent

205
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:18,101
and wants you to assist
with the investigation.

206
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,860
My brother is not home.
There are affairs to attend to.

207
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,941
I am not in a position to assist him.

208
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:32,421
Miss Shen, the general said that
I must invite you over today.

209
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,101
Don't make it hard for me.

210
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,221
(That's where I appeared,
disguised as a bandit.)

211
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:41,941
(It seems I haven't
dispelled his doubts.)

212
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,461
(I can't possibly avoid this.)

213
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:48,981
Lead the way.

214
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Giddy-up! Whoa!

215
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:09,740
(It looks like there was
another group of bandits)

216
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,780
(lying in ambush here back then.)

217
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,901
(The route of retreat.)

218
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,621
(They set up defenses here.
They must be hiding something here.)

219
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:28,701
You triggered the trap
and remained untouched. Who are you?

220
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,981
General of Defense Camp, Xu Chengfeng.

221
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,580
You must be
the notorious top three bandits.

222
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:38,461
I'm impressed, General.

223
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,221
You hid something under this tree.

224
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,405
Dig it out if you want to live.

225
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:45,060
What if I refuse?

226
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:46,621
You have no choice.

227
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,060
Whoa.

228
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Wait here. I'll go have a look.

229
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,621
How dare you attack General Xu?

230
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:35,820
Are you alright?

231
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,421
I'm fine. I appreciate
your help, Miss Shen.

232
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:43,020
(Heaven is helping me.)

233
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,221
(These ignorant bandits
can take the blame.)

234
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:48,340
Die!

235
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:04,500
No!

236
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:19,461
Watch out!

237
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,020
Stay put.
One more step and I'll kill her.

238
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:28,861
Don't threaten me.

239
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,500
She is just a suspect who wants to
conduct a meritorious deed.

240
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,901
Her death would at most be an accident.

241
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,540
I know your trick all too well.

242
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:39,820
Why did she try to save you
if she was a suspect?

243
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,701
So I am just a suspect to you.

244
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,740
We're old acquaintances,
but you deceived me.

245
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,181
Didn't you promise to keep me alive?

246
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:48,701
Behave.

247
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,509
Why would I promise you anything?

248
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:56,740
Now you're going back on your word?

249
00:20:57,661 --> 00:21:00,580
Fine, even if I'm going to die,
I'll drag you down with me.

250
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,181
You can't get away with it.

251
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:03,060
Kill him for me.

252
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,260
How's your foot?

253
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:15,901
It's fine.

254
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,820
Do you know how dangerous it is
to snatch a sword with bare hands?

255
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,300
Didn't I do it to save you?

256
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,861
Besides, wasn't it you
who asked me to come?

257
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,941
Never mind. Be more careful next time.

258
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,500
Is your foot really okay?

259
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,901
It's fine. I appreciate
your concern, General.

260
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,861
General, the top three bandits...

261
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:43,421
Tianhao, check the traps over there.

262
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,709
Understood.

263
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,780
I'll go with you.

264
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,981
No need, you've injured
your foot. Rest over there.

265
00:21:51,981 --> 00:21:52,661
It's not...

266
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:53,293
Let's go.

267
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:02,701
Be careful. Rest here.
I'll check over there.

268
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:14,540
(That was close. But everyone's dead.)

269
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:16,861
(There shouldn't be any more trouble.)

270
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,540
General, I found it.

271
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,300
Keep it down.

272
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:21,461
That's it, right?

273
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:24,580
(Escort Agency Seal)
Chest of Shen Escort Agency

274
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,421
From six months ago.

275
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:28,060
The treasure map must be in here.

276
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:31,820
But Tianhao, remember.
This is confidential.

277
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:35,981
Don't tell Miss Shen about it
even if we're sure she is not a bandit.

278
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:47,020
Why is it empty? Did someone take it?

279
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,901
Keep the chest.

280
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,621
Call some guards with a signal flare
to search this area.

281
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:54,820
Understood.

282
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,060
Come on. Are you feeling better?

283
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,740
Yeah. Where is Tianhao?

284
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,740
We unearthed many things
robbed by the bandits.

285
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,981
Tianhao sent for help.

286
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:15,461
You've caught the culprits.

287
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,901
Do you still think
I'm that female bandit?

288
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:23,540
Miss Shen, I apologize
for my recklessness.

289
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,421
But you took advantage of me just now.

290
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:27,461
So we are even now.

291
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,580
I never took advantage of you.

292
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,461
Really? Why do I recall
someone calling me

293
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:34,540
her old acquaintance?

294
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:40,260
That was just a temporary solution.

295
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:42,500
Anyway, I played along.

296
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,780
No matter what,
you are hurt because of me.

297
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,861
If you want compensation,

298
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,901
come to the General's Mansion
once you recover.

299
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,820
Alright, I hope
you remember what you said.

300
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,500
You're injured and can't ride.
I'll take you back.

301
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,780
Or your brother
won't let me off the hook.

302
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:06,461
No need. I can manage.

303
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:26,621
Young Master.

304
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:29,580
Where is my sister?
I haven't seen her all day.

305
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,060
The deputy general took her away.

306
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:38,957
Zishan, I'm home.

307
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,580
What happened?
Xu Chengfeng is bothering you again?

308
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:44,221
You're not hurt, right?

309
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:48,100
You almost fell out with him for me.

310
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:50,181
How dare he let me get hurt again?

311
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,500
Good. Go back and rest first.

312
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:06,260
What's wrong with your leg? Sit down.

313
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:13,981
We had a deal.
I'm going to settle the score with him.

314
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:14,500
Zishan.

315
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,780
Sit down.

316
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:19,181
Promise me you won't bother him.

317
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,500
Fine. Stay put. Sit.

318
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,981
We ran into bandits.
He did his best to protect me.

319
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,381
Bandits?

320
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:40,397
We stumbled upon the real female bandit.

321
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:44,621
Those bandits are desperate
and ferocious outlaws.

322
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:46,981
But they are all dead now.

323
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:57,621
What's wrong, Zishan?

324
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,461
The bandits who took the imperial cargo

325
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,381
were led by a woman.

326
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:05,100
The authorities looked into it

327
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,661
but half a month passed
and they found nothing.

328
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:12,141
So, you suspect it was them.

329
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:16,820
There is a chance.
I will send someone to look into it.

330
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:21,020
You must have been scared.

331
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,901
I've died once. What is there to fear?

332
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,060
But the upside is that
Chengfeng no longer suspects me.

333
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:40,060
Zishan, since he's no longer
investigating me,

334
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,621
I can focus
on the Luo family once I recover.

335
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,421
Let's not provoke Xu Chengfeng again.

336
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,621
Really, no woman
has ever been hurt for me.

337
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,861
General, what are you looking for?

338
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:21,421
Where is the wound-healing cream
His Majesty bestowed?

339
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,221
Didn't you reward it to me?

340
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:25,020
I did?

341
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:29,820
My second aunt's nephew's
great-uncle took a fall.

342
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:32,861
I gave him the cream. It worked well.

343
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:36,300
Is there any left?
There should be quite a bit.

344
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,221
No idea. Let me ask him.

345
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:44,221
But you're not injured.
Why do you need that?

346
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,621
Well...

347
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,300
- Hmm.
- Miss Shen is hurt. So you want to...

348
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,740
What about Miss Shen?

349
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,621
Alright, Tianhao.
Get it back as soon as possible.

350
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:01,260
Right, how's it going
with that important matter?

351
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:06,340
General, I have collected
and stored all the stolen goods.

352
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:11,780
We can notify the Luo family
to pick up Luo Shuangshuang.

353
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,181
Understood.

354
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,060
Bring the cream back
as soon as possible.

355
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,500
This is an oral medicine
prescribed by Mr. Miao.

356
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,141
Apply the cream at the same time.
Your wound will heal soon.

357
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:31,141
And Mr. Qin brought candied fruits
back from Jiangnan. Especially sweet.

358
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:33,621
I think you can have something sweet

359
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:35,421
to alleviate the pain.

360
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Thank you, Zishan.

361
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,381
It's very sweet.

362
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:01,221
I heard that
Luo Shuangshuang was released today.

363
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,181
The real female bandit is dead,
and I've cleared my name.

364
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,981
She wouldn't be imprisoned
for something she didn't do.

365
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:13,780
I saw it coming.

366
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:15,901
Good for you.

367
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,701
What are your plans now?

368
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,981
The Luos are full of
deceit and trickery.

369
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:31,780
I'm turning them
against each other first.

370
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,861
Let them fight
and I'll take them down one by one.

371
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,300
In the end, I will take back
the brewery from those villains.

372
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:48,100
I will reclaim everything
that once belonged to me.

373
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,221
Alright, but you'll have to
wait until you recover.

374
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,421
Don't get injured again.

375
00:29:55,313 --> 00:29:58,740
(Luo Residence)

376
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,340
I'm so happy today.

377
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:03,981
Shuangshuang is back.
We are finally together.

378
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:06,020
I must thank my sweet girl.

379
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,540
Xue'er, you saved Shuangshuang.

380
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:14,740
Mother, we're a family.
Don't be so distant.

381
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,941
Shuangshuang is not only your daughter
but also my sister.

382
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,300
We're a family. Well said.

383
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,540
Come, cheers.

384
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:33,100
Xue'er, your mother and I
had a discussion.

385
00:30:33,661 --> 00:30:37,820
We've aged. You'll have to take over
the family business one day.

386
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,340
Why don't you gain experience
from now on?

387
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,340
Here, take this.

388
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:55,580
I will visit
several branch stores in a few days.

389
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,540
You've been involved with
the business at Ganlu Brewery.

390
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,901
I will leave it to you for now.

391
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,421
Thank you, Mother.
Thank you, Uncle Jizhou.

392
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:07,740
I will do my best
to live up to the expectations.

393
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,141
You're a smart girl.
I'm sure you can handle it.

394
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,340
I'm away for a few days
and you've become more hypocritical.

395
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:16,381
I can't stand to watch you like this.

396
00:31:20,181 --> 00:31:20,941
That little...

397
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,901
Xue'er, sit.

398
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:25,181
Sit.

399
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:27,580
Let's eat first.
I will talk to her later.

400
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,221
Here.

401
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,060
Miss Shuangshuang,
this is the snake venom powder.

402
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,461
Apply it for three days,
and your face will be smaller.

403
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,820
Why don't you buy three boxes?

404
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,060
I'll give you a discount
and take 120 taels. What do you think?

405
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,260
But I only have 100 taels with me.

406
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:59,580
Oh, I see.

407
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:05,300
Miss Shuangshuang,
Miss Bai from the prefect's family

408
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,917
asked me for this powder a few days ago.

409
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:10,673
She said she'd take it all.

410
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,020
I'm the most renowned
beauty expert in Liao City.

411
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,540
How could I let someone else
get this fancy powder?

412
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,901
I'll take these.

413
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:19,580
But...

414
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Don't you have 20 taels? Give it to me.

415
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,740
Miss, my brother
has been sick for a month.

416
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,221
He needs the money
for treatment and medicine, Miss.

417
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,100
He's been sick for a month anyway.

418
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,621
He can wait for a day or two.

419
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:35,340
You poor people are tough.
He might recover in a few days.

420
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:39,469
If worse comes to worst,
I'll have my mother send a physician.

421
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:41,300
Give me the money first.

422
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:42,901
- Miss.
- Give it to me.

423
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:43,901
- Please don't!
- Lowly wench!

424
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:44,941
Miss!

425
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:45,780
Give it to me!

426
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:52,181
I think I'm a bit thinner.
Don't you think, Shuixian?

427
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:58,381
Stop crying. You're sobbing
all day. It brings bad luck.

428
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:01,340
If you're so concerned about
your brother, get out of here

429
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,260
and take care of him.

430
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,500
Please don't drive me away.

431
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,381
I still need money to save my brother.

432
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:13,981
What happened, Shuixian?
You've upset my daughter again?

433
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:15,020
- I...
- Mother.

434
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:17,701
I just scolded her a bit.

435
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:20,340
And she kept crying. So dispiriting.

436
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,300
We should just drive her away.

437
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,740
Alright, let's not keep someone
who upsets my sweet girl.

438
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,981
Please don't, Madam. Don't send me away.

439
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:31,661
Get out. Don't let me see you again.

440
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,181
Shuangshuang, what you did
was really inappropriate.

441
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:42,285
I drove away my own maid.
You don't get to lecture me.

442
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,260
Even Mother agreed to it.

443
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,260
No matter what,
Mother always loves me the most.

444
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,901
It won't work
no matter how you play nice.

445
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:58,141
I have never expected Mother
to love me as much as she loves you.

446
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:04,100
Meanwhile, you will never
be as calm and smart as I am.

447
00:34:04,661 --> 00:34:06,300
You... You...

448
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,020
You haven't had enough in prison?

449
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:12,821
How dare you bring it up?

450
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:14,620
You only
throw your weight around at home.

451
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,700
Why don't you retaliate against
those who got you into prison?

452
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,500
What do you mean? Someone set me up?

453
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,861
I asked Shuixian.

454
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:29,301
It all started with
that box of Dai flower powder.

455
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:32,741
You snatched it
from Shen Danqing, didn't you?

456
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:37,220
I've thought it all through.

457
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:41,100
I'm sure it has something to do
with Shen Danqing.

458
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,861
And she's the only one
we've had a run-in with lately.

459
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,700
General Xu misunderstood you
because of her.

460
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,700
I bet she did something.

461
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:55,620
I knew it! I knew
I wouldn't be so unlucky.

462
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,421
That wench played some tricks

463
00:34:57,421 --> 00:34:58,981
to ruin my chance with General Xu.

464
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:07,140
You've been strange lately.

465
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,540
You were crying over Luo Ailian
just the other day.

466
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,580
How did you change at the drop of a hat?

467
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:19,140
You started pleasing Mother. And now,
you're even showing concern for me.

468
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,700
Luo Xue'er, what are you up to?

469
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:28,941
I'm not concerned about you,
but the Luo family.

470
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,941
During these encounters,

471
00:35:31,941 --> 00:35:34,620
Shen Danqing caused us huge losses.

472
00:35:35,741 --> 00:35:39,140
I've wracked my brain and still can't
figure out why she's so against us.

473
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:46,781
We should unite against Shen Danqing

474
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:48,461
at this point.

475
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,220
So, are you going to fess up or not?

476
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:04,861
(I left that scar-eyed bandit alive)

477
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:05,741
on purpose.

478
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:08,301
Bring him back to me alive.

479
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:08,981
Understood.

480
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,261
I've never seen the thing you mentioned.

481
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,941
We didn't rob the Luo family's grain.

482
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:17,700
I've told you everything I know.

483
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,381
Just kill me.

484
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,341
You want to die? Not so easy. Tianhao.

485
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,060
Got it.

486
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,821
No, no, no!

487
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:42,660
Don't be afraid.
My friend here has a method.

488
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,100
If he stabs your left arm 100 times,
he will do the same to your right arm.

489
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:50,381
Absolutely symmetrical. Highly skilled.

490
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:53,700
Please spare me.
I swear I don't know anything.

491
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,821
I'm asking you one last time.

492
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:59,381
Where is the stuff
in that chest you robbed

493
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:01,060
from Shen Escort Agency?

494
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,540
I haven't seen anything in there.

495
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,341
Go ahead.

496
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,660
No! I swear I'm telling the truth
or you can cut off my tongue.

497
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,341
Our leader went through
so much to rob them.

498
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:15,500
We got that chest.

499
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,885
But we took it back
and it had already been opened.

500
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:22,821
There was nothing inside.

501
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,060
Tianhao.

502
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:29,485
How did you know
that someone had opened it?

503
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,301
The box was intact
when we got our hands on it.

504
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,741
But there was nothing in there.

505
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:39,901
We carefully examined the lock.

506
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,901
It had been burnt out by something.

507
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:52,461
General, what's going on here?

508
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,261
It seems the treasure map
was taken out before they got to it.

509
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:05,660
These bandits were kept in the dark
like the Shen family.

510
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:07,781
They're the scapegoats.

511
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:16,741
Who did it?
And where is the treasure map?

512
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:54,056
♪I've stepped into a maze,
