=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,432 --> 00:01:22,312
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:27,186
You're a general.
How could you do such things?

4
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:28,906
If I didn't do it,

5
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,147
how could I see you alone?

6
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:39,386
General, you...

7
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:50,427
Miss Shen,

8
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:52,587
why are you blushing now?

9
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:55,106
Who's blushing?

10
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:57,787
General, please don't keep
getting so close to me.

11
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:01,466
Danqing,

12
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:05,587
the Tanghulu you want.

13
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:11,546
Thanks.

14
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:16,227
Are you here to ruin my plan?

15
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:18,386
Aren't you too?

16
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:24,947
What are you talking about?

17
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:27,627
I mean

18
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,227
General Xu

19
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:31,146
is a very unique man.

20
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:33,227
His performance was truly splendid.

21
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:35,347
You flatter me.

22
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:39,106
Let's go.

23
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:46,507
Zishan.

24
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:48,187
Are you sick of it? Let me try.

25
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,947
It's so sour. Not tasty at all.

26
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:55,146
Danqing,

27
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:56,546
since the flower represents marriage,

28
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:57,586
I will keep it safe for you.

29
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:02,027
It is really sour.

30
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,586
Let me taste one.

31
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,347
It's quite lively up ahead.
I'll go take a look.

32
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,586
I did think you would come,

33
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:14,546
but I didn't expect you to dance.

34
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:16,266
Just a little trick.

35
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:21,787
Don't think your little tricks

36
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:22,507
will make me concede.

37
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:24,307
Same to you.

38
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:32,467
Danqing.

39
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,067
Want to try?

40
00:03:36,307 --> 00:03:38,266
I just find this prize
quite interesting.

41
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,507
Miss, you have a good eye.

42
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,187
This prize

43
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,307
is a rabbit lantern made by my own wife.

44
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:45,787
One of a kind.

45
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,747
When I was a child, my mother
also made me a rabbit lantern.

46
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:50,826
It resembled this one,

47
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:52,666
somewhat.

48
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:56,627
Don't worry. I will win it over for you.

49
00:03:58,106 --> 00:03:58,706
No need, General.

50
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:01,027
I will win the prize for my sister.

51
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:02,307
Why not

52
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,347
have a competition?

53
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,907
The rabbit lantern will go
to the one with the better skills.

54
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:07,627
Okay?

55
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:08,712
Okay.

56
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:24,586
Impressive.

57
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:25,507
So impressive!

58
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:27,226
Perfect accuracy.

59
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:33,067
Zishan, let's go hang a wishing plaque.

60
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:34,987
Alright, I'll do it with you.

61
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,026
Sir, I'll take the prize.

62
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:42,947
Please.

63
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:43,906
Take care.

64
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,427
Miss Xu.

65
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,026
Let's go look at the river lanterns.

66
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:52,747
Alright.

67
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:08,667
Can I see what you wrote?

68
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:09,706
Sure.

69
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:11,346
Of course.

70
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:15,386
General.

71
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,466
Would you like to hang one
for safety as well?

72
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:21,547
It cannot give me what I want.

73
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:23,586
Danqing.

74
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:25,466
I want an answer.

75
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,826
Can you give me?

76
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:37,386
Zishan, I would like
some glutinous rice dumplings.

77
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,507
Can you buy one for me?

78
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,026
Okay.

79
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:53,266
You like it.

80
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:55,226
For you.

81
00:05:58,346 --> 00:05:59,747
When I was looking
at this rabbit lantern,

82
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:01,466
I thought it was like the one

83
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:02,987
my mother made for me.

84
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:05,706
But now in my hands, I see it clearly.

85
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:08,307
It's not that alike.

86
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:12,507
Some memories

87
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,026
should be only kept in the brain.

88
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:16,667
Putting them before you

89
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,627
will lose their meaning.

90
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:21,627
But some things

91
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:23,386
do not just become memories.

92
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:25,906
Just like a seed.

93
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:28,107
As long as you diligently water it,

94
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:30,987
it will surely sprout and bloom.

95
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:33,586
I understand you.

96
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:35,706
But

97
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:37,466
I can't take

98
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:39,667
your feelings.

99
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:43,187
Danqing.

100
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:45,586
I know you're into me.

101
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,744
I do not know why you rejected me,

102
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:51,107
but I still want to tell you

103
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:53,947
no matter what happens,

104
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:56,026
I will be by your side.

105
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:58,226
You can trust me.

106
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,307
Do you know that?

107
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:03,307
For such a long time,

108
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,627
I have always felt
that you carry a heavy burden.

109
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:10,627
If you are willing,

110
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:12,107
you can tell me.

111
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:14,867
Let me share it with you. Is that good?

112
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,987
I don't know how to say it.

113
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:20,747
In fact...

114
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:41,786
Danqing, what's wrong?

115
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:43,947
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:46,906
Danqing, you...

117
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:53,466
Thank you.

118
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,586
But all I can say to you now

119
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:57,947
is just thank you.

120
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,826
What happened before,

121
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:03,867
just take it as a dream.

122
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,386
Are you okay?

123
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:28,667
Why didn't you take

124
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:30,547
Chengfeng's rabbit lantern?

125
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:34,226
I don't want to give him hope.

126
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:36,547
You know what?

127
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,067
He still remembers
Luo Ailian to this day.

128
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,267
And he blames himself
for not being able to save her.

129
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:45,427
The funny thing is

130
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:47,746
I'm standing right in front of him,

131
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,387
yet I can't tell him
that I am Luo Ailian.

132
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:52,667
Not your fault.

133
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:54,667
It's all destiny.

134
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,387
Now Luo Xue'er
can't cause trouble anymore.

135
00:08:58,626 --> 00:08:59,506
Once the reason

136
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:01,387
why the Xiao family fell is clear,

137
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:04,626
I will make her admit
her guilt incontrovertibly.

138
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:06,947
I want all the people
of Liao City to know

139
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:09,586
that Luo Ailian was not a murderer.

140
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:15,506
Everything will be over soon.

141
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:16,626
Then

142
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,106
you will do whatever you want.

143
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:21,787
I will be with you.

144
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:26,586
I hope

145
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:29,027
everything goes well as you say.

146
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:05,826
General.

147
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,226
Our spy sent to monitor
Prince Yi has reported back.

148
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:19,547
The Mos in the north.

149
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:20,986
The Hes of the South.

150
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:24,106
Prince Yi's men have visited
so many remarkable people

151
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:25,187
to make inquiries

152
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:26,346
about mechanism arts

153
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:27,267
and formation tactics.

154
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:28,626
It's obvious

155
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,947
they are attempting
to decipher something.

156
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,866
As you speculated.

157
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:36,746
Prince Yi didn't crack
the secret of the treasure map.

158
00:10:37,147 --> 00:10:38,187
It seems that the map

159
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:40,187
was encrypted in a special way.

160
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:41,586
To decode the map,

161
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:43,427
one must have a specific tool.

162
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:45,586
Pass this message to the minister

163
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:46,667
and ask him to help

164
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:48,787
find out

165
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:49,826
what the tool is.

166
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:50,632
Yes.

167
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,307
If we find the decryption tool
before Prince Yi does,

168
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:55,826
we would gain an advantage.

169
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:56,968
Yes.

170
00:10:58,187 --> 00:10:59,986
If the minister has any reply
in the next few days,

171
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:01,187
tell me immediately.

172
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:03,147
Yes, General.

173
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:10,907
Is there anything else?

174
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,427
Didn't you have a date
with Miss Shen at the temple fair?

175
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:19,187
This is given by Miss Shen?

176
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:22,947
I gave it to her,

177
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:24,706
but she gave it back.

178
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:28,027
She gave back your gift?

179
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:30,027
General,

180
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:31,547
does it mean

181
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:33,187
you are

182
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:34,706
in unrequited love?

183
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:43,787
I know Danqing has feelings for me.

184
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:46,826
But perhaps my strategy wasn't right.

185
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:47,787
Strategy?

186
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:49,986
Actually, love and military strategy

187
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:51,667
perhaps intersect.

188
00:11:52,706 --> 00:11:53,667
Only with proper methods

189
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:55,187
can one achieve one's desires.

190
00:11:58,147 --> 00:11:59,187
Military tactics.

191
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:06,826
General, I've just thought of one.

192
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:08,427
What is it?

193
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:10,187
Go for the roundabout method.

194
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:11,907
Use tricks.

195
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:13,586
Do you have any ideas?

196
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:16,427
You'll know when the time comes.

197
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:18,387
Leave it to me.

198
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,106
Just wait for the good news.

199
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:24,307
Tianhao, don't mess around.

200
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:26,147
I am well-versed in military tactics.

201
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:28,506
You rascal.

202
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,626
(Shen Mansion)
Check on the carriage.

203
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:46,826
Let's go straight there.

204
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,147
Don't waste time.

205
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:48,947
Yes.

206
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:52,904
Miss Shen,

207
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:55,346
Miss Du has returned
from Kucha with Tieli.

208
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:56,866
I will bring the things in.

209
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:58,346
You two have a good catch-up.

210
00:12:58,706 --> 00:12:59,187
I'm going in.

211
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,427
(Ying'er, Tieli?)

212
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:04,947
(Judging by his tone,)

213
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:06,787
(Shen Danqing knew them well.)

214
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:09,466
(But the diary Zishan gave me
never mentions those people.)

215
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:10,387
We finally arrived.

216
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:12,547
Long time no see.

217
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:19,866
(Oh, no. Which one is Ying'er?)

218
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:24,947
The one in the blue clothes.

219
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:29,067
Ying'er.

220
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:31,147
Long time no see.

221
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,346
You sound quite warm.

222
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:35,907
But you didn't recognize me at all.

223
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:37,466
After only four years,

224
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:38,826
you don't recognize me.

225
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,346
How could I not recognize you?

226
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,067
I didn't recognize you.

227
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,466
How come you seem more rustic

228
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,547
after four years?

229
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:48,187
Say it again.

230
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,826
I won't change it
even if I repeat it ten times.

231
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:53,626
You're so annoying.

232
00:13:54,986 --> 00:13:56,027
But you have become prettier

233
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:57,547
after four years.

234
00:13:58,147 --> 00:13:59,706
Alright. Don't stand here anymore.

235
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:00,746
Hurry inside.

236
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,787
I'll order good dishes at Zuiyun Tower

237
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:03,826
for you.

238
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:04,466
Yeah.

239
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:05,667
Someone.

240
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:07,506
You go get ready.

241
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,826
We have to go to the winery.

242
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:10,586
When I'm back, I'll throw
a nice welcoming party.

243
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:11,706
Okay.

244
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:12,986
Please.

245
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:14,547
We'll go in.

246
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,027
Who exactly is she?

247
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:22,307
What was their relationship?

248
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:23,986
Her full name is Du Ying'er.

249
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:25,586
She was Danqing's friend

250
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:27,147
who grew up with her.

251
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:30,466
She went to Kucha
with her father four years ago.

252
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:32,826
It's far away, so we've lost contact.

253
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:34,826
It was my oversight.

254
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:37,067
I thought you would
never meet her in this lifetime.

255
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:40,787
They were friends,

256
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,106
so they knew each other well.

257
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:45,466
Do you know any more information
about her? The more, the better.

258
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,346
I wanna avoid any slip-up when we talk.

259
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:49,506
It was always my sister
who hung out with her.

260
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:52,267
I never inquired
about the girls' matters.

261
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,387
I can't recall much at the moment.

262
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:57,866
It seems we can only

263
00:14:58,547 --> 00:14:59,147
play it by ear.

264
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,586
I will accompany you to the winery.

265
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:03,667
Let's discuss it on the way.

266
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:05,907
Go.

267
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:10,667
(General Xu,)

268
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:12,706
our lady has gone out
and is not at the mansion.

269
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:19,866
It's okay. I will sit for a short while.

270
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:21,067
Leave me.

271
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:27,427
Please have some tea.

272
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:29,027
Miss Du.

273
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:31,947
This is...

274
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:34,427
This is General Xu,
the defender of Liao City.

275
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:36,986
General Xu, this is Miss Du Ying'er.

276
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:38,667
She is a good friend of our lady.

277
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,067
Nice to meet you, General Xu.
I am Du Ying'er,

278
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:42,267
Danqing's good friend.

279
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:44,506
General, you are here to see Danqing.

280
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:45,256
Exactly.

281
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:47,826
I am Xu Chengfeng,
also a friend of Danqing.

282
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:53,746
If you can be Danqing's friend,

283
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:56,307
you must be quite outstanding.

284
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:58,547
Miss Du, you flatter me.

285
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,226
Since you came to visit Danqing,

286
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:04,106
I won't disturb you.
I shall take my leave.

287
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:06,067
General Xu,

288
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,027
I have just returned from Kucha.

289
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,387
Danqing will hold a party for me.

290
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:11,147
Since you are Danqing's friend,

291
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:12,866
why not join us?

292
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:14,088
Well...

293
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:16,147
Be a man and make it snappy.

294
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:19,427
Then I shall gladly comply.

295
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:21,907
Let's go. I'll show you around.

296
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:27,067
(Morality)
As for the Hetian jade,

297
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:28,147
I do know a little.

298
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:29,586
Oh, really?

299
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,866
If I remember correctly, the Hetian jade

300
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:33,187
from Southern Xinjiang is good.

301
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:34,376
That's right.

302
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,106
Danqing, you're back!

303
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:39,464
Danqing,

304
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,826
this new friend of yours is really witty

305
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:43,336
and well-informed, too.

306
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,746
Thanks to General Xu,
he kept me company while you were away.

307
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:47,346
Otherwise, I would be very bored.

308
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,147
Thank you.

309
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:50,216
Miss Du and I

310
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:51,787
hit it off straight away.

311
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:55,586
That must have been hard for you.

312
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:57,387
How can you call it hard?

313
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,027
Meeting Miss Du

314
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:01,067
is a stroke of fortune for me.

315
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:04,347
May I know what brings you here today?

316
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:05,986
Today,

317
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:08,947
actually, I planned to ask you

318
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:10,786
about some brewing techniques.

319
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:12,266
But it's okay.

320
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:14,466
Getting to know Miss Du

321
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,266
is what's truly worthwhile.

322
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:18,627
Not at all.

323
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:20,306
Today, we're throwing a party

324
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,867
at home for this friend
I haven't seen for a long time.

325
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:26,506
If it's inconvenient,
how about another day?

326
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,867
It's okay. I'm just gonna
make some new friends.

327
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,226
The more, the merrier.

328
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:32,187
Since it's a welcoming party for me,

329
00:17:32,306 --> 00:17:33,706
I have the final say.

330
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,627
In that case, please come inside.

331
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:46,466
Cheers.

332
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,427
Ying'er, what brings you

333
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:56,667
to this city?

334
00:17:58,387 --> 00:17:59,986
I'm here on business.

335
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:02,867
Miss Du's father entrusted her
with a batch of Hetian jade to sell

336
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:03,947
in the Central Plains.

337
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:05,986
She plans to sell it right here

338
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:07,026
and gets to see

339
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:08,627
old friends too.

340
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:10,827
It shows Miss Du

341
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:13,066
cherishes her friendship
with you a lot, Miss Shen.

342
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:16,387
General Xu,

343
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:18,306
you know quite a lot.

344
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:21,746
How long will it take you to sell

345
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:22,546
these goods?

346
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:23,827
How would I know?

347
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,627
Actually, it doesn't matter
how long it takes.

348
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:27,706
I don't wanna go home.

349
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:31,107
I'd rather spend more days with Danqing.

350
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:32,226
Right, Danqing?

351
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,147
Your friendship is truly enviable.

352
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,546
There must be many unforgettable things
between you two.

353
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:41,627
Yes.

354
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:43,667
We didn't just grow up together.

355
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:45,627
We even had some life-or-death moments.

356
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:48,306
Speaking of which,
Danqing saved my life.

357
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:50,907
Danqing, do you remember?

358
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,147
It's such an old matter,
better left unmentioned.

359
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,026
Why?

360
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,107
When I was about eight,

361
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:01,066
I accidentally fell into a pond.

362
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,427
Without her who risked her life
to save me in the water,

363
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:05,706
I would no longer be in this world.

364
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:10,266
Danqing,

365
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:12,827
you can swim?

366
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,427
(Oh, no. If I say I can swim,)

367
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:17,827
(it'll contradict what I said
to Xu Chengfeng.)

368
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:19,706
(If I say I can't swim,)

369
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:21,587
(I can't explain it to Du Ying'er.)

370
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,466
I remember that matter clearly.

371
00:19:23,986 --> 00:19:25,706
Danqing was young.
She might have forgotten.

372
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:27,347
She could swim before,

373
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,107
but she was afraid of water
after going into the water

374
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:31,947
to save Ying'er.

375
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:33,466
And she never swam again.

376
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:37,266
Zishan, you still remember?
I had forgotten.

377
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,147
After recovering from my injury,

378
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,147
I lost many of my memories.

379
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:43,546
Injured?

380
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,066
What happened to you?

381
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:46,427
It's the past.

382
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:48,546
I am fine right before you, aren't I?

383
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:51,107
You two really have

384
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,466
a bond forged through life and death.

385
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:59,347
Alright. The dishes
are about to get cold.

386
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,232
Let's eat.

387
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,066
Eat.

388
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:06,947
You eat too.

389
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:08,466
Thanks, Zishan.

390
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:13,546
Ying'er, let me help you.

391
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:23,667
Miss Du, be careful. It's hot.

392
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:25,768
Thank you.

393
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:48,107
You really got jealous.

394
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:51,587
General.

395
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:53,427
What is it?

396
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,256
The minister's letter.

397
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:08,986
Just as I expected.

398
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:11,187
Based on my clues, the minister

399
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:12,466
has confirmed the map

400
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:15,147
doesn't directly depict the path
and location of the treasure.

401
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:19,387
Instead, we need to spray
special developing water

402
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:20,266
on the map

403
00:21:20,706 --> 00:21:21,627
to see the route.

404
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:23,506
So that day

405
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:26,506
the clue Prince Yi wanted

406
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:28,107
to get from our case files

407
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,427
was the developing water.

408
00:21:29,786 --> 00:21:31,306
So where is it now?

409
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:32,546
No definite news.

410
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:34,026
But he also mentioned

411
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:35,147
the developing water

412
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,427
is related to a collector
with the surname Ouyang.

413
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:44,328
And?

414
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:45,907
The minister also mentioned

415
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,026
the collector

416
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:49,587
was the friend of Luo Jida

417
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:51,107
who ran liquor business

418
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:52,168
in this city.

419
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:53,147
Mr. Luo?

420
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,546
Luo Jida, the deceased master
of the Luo family?

421
00:21:58,627 --> 00:21:59,066
That's right.

422
00:22:08,147 --> 00:22:09,667
So Mr. Xiao lost all his family's wealth

423
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:11,107
because of gambling.

424
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:13,786
I've searched through
all the account books involved.

425
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,506
In the year their family was ruined,

426
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,026
the money transactions
basically match up with them.

427
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:20,187
Mr. Xiao became addicted to gambling,

428
00:22:20,746 --> 00:22:22,387
and his family started to fall.

429
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:24,506
Later, the Luo family
took over their industry.

430
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:26,706
All were reasonable
and normal transactions.

431
00:22:27,427 --> 00:22:29,147
The Luo family
has been operating here for years.

432
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:32,306
Their integrity and generosity
are well acclaimed.

433
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:34,066
Mr. Luo's virtues

434
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:35,587
are beyond question.

435
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:38,266
Yes. After the bankruptcy,

436
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:40,147
Mr. Xiao couldn't bear
losing his property

437
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:42,306
and actually gambled with the assets

438
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:43,466
taken by the Luo family.

439
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:45,466
Mr. Luo was benevolent.

440
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:47,026
He helped him clear all his debts

441
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:49,306
and then hired him
to work at the winery.

442
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,347
But he gambled again.

443
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:54,066
Mr. Luo no longer allowed
him to handle money.

444
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,226
You reap what you sow.

445
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:57,506
And Luo Xue'er?

446
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:00,226
Is she truly Mr. Xiao's daughter?

447
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,587
Yes. Luo Xue'er's biological mother,
Ms. Zhou,

448
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:03,947
was Mr. Xiao's concubine before.

449
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:05,147
After Mr. Xiao's death,

450
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:07,506
Ms. Zhou started working at the winery.

451
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:08,986
She was already close with the Luos.

452
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:11,187
Not long after, she married Mr. Luo.

453
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,867
She gave birth to Luo Xue'er
two months prematurely.

454
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:15,867
All those involved in the childbirth

455
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:17,746
were secretly sent out
of the city by Ms. Zhou

456
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:18,667
without exception.

457
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:20,746
Anything else?

458
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:22,387
This is all we have found out so far.

459
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:25,266
The details of the ghost marriage
between the Dus and the Luos

460
00:23:25,546 --> 00:23:26,728
are to be investigated.

461
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:28,187
Besides these account books,

462
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:30,986
there must be a butler who presided
over the Xiao family's split-up.

463
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:33,066
Please find him as well.

464
00:23:33,907 --> 00:23:34,280
Yes.

465
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:40,347
Zishan.

466
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:44,904
Ying'er went to bed?

467
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:45,786
Already.

468
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:48,226
She kept talking all day long.

469
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,066
I wonder where she got
all that energy from.

470
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:51,427
No slip-ups, right?

471
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:53,266
Trust me.

472
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,306
What do you want?

473
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,107
Mr. Luo has returned.

474
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,986
Did you find any clues
about what Luo Xue'er

475
00:24:01,546 --> 00:24:02,466
said about the Xiaos?

476
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,187
We found Xia's account books.

477
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:06,427
We just need a witness.

478
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:08,306
Mr. Luo has already gone to find one.

479
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,347
To make Luo Xue'er confess

480
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:13,347
to clear Luo Ailian's name,

481
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:16,347
we must uncover the whole truth

482
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:17,986
and have her admit her guilt.

483
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:21,107
Before everything comes to light,

484
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:22,907
it's better to be cautious.

485
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:24,226
Now that Ying'er is here,

486
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:27,187
we gotta be more careful
to hide your identity.

487
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:29,256
By the way,

488
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,627
I sorted out this new diary

489
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:34,587
about some
of Ying'er's likes and habits.

490
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:37,066
Take a look. I hope it helps you.

491
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:40,347
Okay, I'll take a good look later.

492
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:43,667
Zishan, if there's nothing else,
you should sleep early.

493
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:45,066
I'm leaving.

494
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:49,466
Wait a minute.

495
00:24:57,466 --> 00:24:58,667
I have one more thing to ask you.

496
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:06,786
Xu Chengfeng.

497
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:09,266
After he rescued you
from Prince Yi's place

498
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:11,546
and the temple fair,

499
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:13,827
I can tell

500
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:15,387
that he fell for you

501
00:25:16,387 --> 00:25:17,266
and you

502
00:25:19,627 --> 00:25:20,680
fell for him too.

503
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:30,627
Since you agree,

504
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:32,627
I must remind you

505
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,867
you are not Shen Danqing,

506
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:36,187
but Luo Ailian.

507
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,306
I met Chengfeng three years ago.

508
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:38,947
I know him.

509
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:41,107
He seems frivolous on the surface,

510
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,066
but he is sharp inside.

511
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:44,907
Should one day he come
to know your true identity,

512
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:46,066
how will he feel?

513
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,746
You can't deceive him for a lifetime.

514
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:52,587
Have you thought about it?

515
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:55,706
Zishan,

516
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:57,266
I have

517
00:25:58,026 --> 00:25:58,907
my own plans for it.

518
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:03,752
In your heart,

519
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,546
you hoped that he would
guess your identity, right?

520
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,587
If there really comes such a day,

521
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:15,266
I will

522
00:26:15,986 --> 00:26:16,986
tell him all the truth.

523
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:20,107
Zishan, you know him.

524
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:21,827
You know he has a heart of gold.

525
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,026
But he's not the only one

526
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:24,427
with a heart of gold.

527
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:28,191
♪We've been tied by fate
for half a lifetime♪

528
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:30,947
♪One thought goes up
as another goes down♪

529
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:31,786
What I mean is,

530
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,387
there are many good men in this world.

531
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:39,187
I don't want you to take this risk.

532
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,786
No matter how he
values your relationship,

533
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:45,667
it's a fact that you lied
to him about your identity.

534
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:47,867
I don't know if he will hurt you

535
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,066
after he learns the truth.

536
00:26:51,706 --> 00:26:53,706
I just don't want you
to receive any hurt.

537
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:56,786
Do you understand what I mean?

538
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:04,456
Yes.

539
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:11,347
It there's nothing else,

540
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:12,427
I'm leaving.

541
00:27:14,546 --> 00:27:15,427
Go to bed early.

542
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:47,347
Danqing!

543
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:53,786
Come in.

544
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,907
Ying'er, why are you here this late?

545
00:27:59,506 --> 00:28:00,187
Have a seat.

546
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:01,706
Haven't you gone to bed?

547
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:05,107
I just inquired about your past injury
with the servants.

548
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:07,986
They said it took a long time
for your injury to heal,

549
00:28:08,347 --> 00:28:09,347
and that you nearly died.

550
00:28:09,746 --> 00:28:10,587
They exaggerated.

551
00:28:10,986 --> 00:28:12,466
Look at me now. Aren't I fine?

552
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:15,226
You have recovered physically,

553
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:18,026
but you seem to have
forgotten many things

554
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:19,387
from the past.

555
00:28:20,147 --> 00:28:21,066
I've finally understood

556
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:23,026
why the way you look at me

557
00:28:24,026 --> 00:28:25,387
is different from before.

558
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:28,466
Ying'er, I...

559
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,546
I don't care.

560
00:28:29,986 --> 00:28:31,387
I don't care how much
you have forgotten.

561
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:32,466
But I remember it all.

562
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:35,026
I remember everything
since we were young.

563
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:37,587
Danqing, you must remember

564
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:39,107
we are the best friends

565
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:40,168
forever.

566
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:43,306
Yes, the best friends.

567
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:47,627
Danqing, what happened
to the back of your neck?

568
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,226
A scar was left from a previous injury,

569
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,986
so I had a black lotus tattooed over it.

570
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:57,587
Let me look.

571
00:29:01,347 --> 00:29:02,627
Is this a burn scar?

572
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:05,546
Danqing, it must have hurt you a lot.

573
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:07,147
It was such a big thing.

574
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:08,107
Why didn't you tell me?

575
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:10,907
If I had known you were injured,
I would have rushed back.

576
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:14,187
Kucha is so far away.

577
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:16,667
I didn't want you to travel so far

578
00:29:16,947 --> 00:29:17,907
because of my injury.

579
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:20,107
Moreover, once the wound healed,

580
00:29:20,107 --> 00:29:22,026
it felt even less necessary
to mention it.

581
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,506
It wasn't a good thing.

582
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:26,466
Bringing it up would
just cause unnecessary worry.

583
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,827
No, you can't be like that again.

584
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:29,907
Promise.

585
00:29:30,107 --> 00:29:31,466
No matter what happens in the future,

586
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:32,266
don't hide it from me.

587
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,347
Right, there's one more thing.

588
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:40,066
This Kucha-style dress I'm wearing

589
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:41,907
really stands out too much.

590
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,546
I want to go to a silk shop

591
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:45,066
to buy some local style clothes.

592
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:47,746
Do you have time
to go shopping with me tomorrow?

593
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:50,306
If you see any clothes
or jewelry you like, just buy them.

594
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:51,048
My treat.

595
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:53,704
Okay.

596
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:15,066
General.

597
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:17,064
General.

598
00:30:17,827 --> 00:30:18,506
What is it?

599
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:20,226
It's working.

600
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:21,827
Military tactics are effective.

601
00:30:23,226 --> 00:30:24,347
What's working?

602
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:24,786
Look.

603
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:26,827
So many cards.

604
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:28,587
What cards?

605
00:30:29,187 --> 00:30:31,706
General, do you remember
the "roundabout method"?

606
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:34,187
I have spread the word

607
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:35,546
saying you will get married.

608
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,427
Now it's spread all over the whole city.

609
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:38,587
Miss Shen will hear it.

610
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,026
What?

611
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:41,187
Miss Shen will hear it.

612
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:44,107
You read military books,

613
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:45,466
but what a bad idea.

614
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:46,867
I was just thinking

615
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:49,546
it might make Miss Shen
become even more concerned with you.

616
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:51,546
So you are selling me out?

617
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:54,107
They say you can't succeed
without making sacrifices.

618
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:55,667
General!

619
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:57,986
General,

620
00:30:58,387 --> 00:30:59,786
these people request see you.

621
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:01,746
So many.

622
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,587
General, which one shall we see first?

623
00:31:06,226 --> 00:31:07,986
Not any of them.
I want to go to the Shen Mansion.

624
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,627
General.

625
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:11,026
General, please. It's just dawn.

626
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:13,107
The prefect of Qingzhou
and Mr. Li are waiting outside.

627
00:31:13,226 --> 00:31:13,867
Mr. Li is alright.

628
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:15,427
The old prefect came all the way here.

629
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:16,266
You should see him.

630
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,387
- Don't military books say...?
- Shut up.

631
00:31:20,552 --> 00:31:21,026
General.

632
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:23,066
General, I was wrong.

633
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:25,546
You're so lovely.

634
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:27,026
Pink suits you the best.

635
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:28,546
You have great taste.

636
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:31,827
Sir, I'd like this one.

637
00:31:33,347 --> 00:31:33,947
Sir.

638
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,347
Sorry.

639
00:31:38,786 --> 00:31:40,306
What are you listening to so intently?

640
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:41,066
You even ignore us?

641
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:42,187
You don't know yet?

642
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,896
General Xu Chengfeng
is going to get married soon.

643
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:47,627
Early this morning,

644
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:49,827
the threshold of his mansion
has almost been worn down.

645
00:31:50,187 --> 00:31:51,226
They released a message.

646
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:52,907
Any eligible young lady

647
00:31:53,466 --> 00:31:54,667
from a decent family

648
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:57,187
can send a matchmaker
to the General's Mansion

649
00:31:57,387 --> 00:31:58,627
to check their marital compatibility.

650
00:32:00,427 --> 00:32:01,907
Danqing, are you alright?

651
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:04,706
I'm fine.

652
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:06,107
We should go check out other stores.

653
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:07,226
Should we go somewhere else?

654
00:32:07,907 --> 00:32:09,226
Sorry for my behavior just now.

655
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,026
No need.

656
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,066
I know you're busy with your business.

657
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,506
Aren't you gonna check the accounts?

658
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:15,867
I'm not that thoughtless.

659
00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:16,667
Do your things.

660
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,587
I'll just take a stroll
and then head home.

661
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:20,968
Let's go.

662
00:32:29,306 --> 00:32:29,827
(Du Ying'er?)

663
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:32,427
(She knows Shen Danqing,)

664
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:34,667
(and they seem very close.)

665
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:37,928
(God is really helping me.)

666
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:46,627
Prefect, I have important matters today.
Please go back.

667
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:50,746
General, if you do not take
to my eldest daughter,

668
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:52,347
I have a younger daughter.

669
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,066
- Please.
- General.

670
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:56,226
My young daughter
is beautiful and intelligent.

671
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:58,266
She is a few years
younger than you, but...

672
00:32:58,266 --> 00:32:59,786
H-H-How many years?

673
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:01,867
Tianhao.

674
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:03,786
She is 14.

675
00:33:04,627 --> 00:33:05,266
General.

676
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:06,107
You all.

677
00:33:06,387 --> 00:33:07,026
General.

678
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:10,147
Prefect, please don't push.

679
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:11,947
A fine marriage.

680
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:12,867
General, wait for me.

681
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:14,786
- A perfect match.
- General.

682
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,066
General, wait.

683
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:17,128
Quiet!

684
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:19,587
Everyone,

685
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:22,546
today, I do have
important matters to attend to.

686
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:24,107
If anyone stops me again,

687
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:25,266
whoever it is,

688
00:33:25,907 --> 00:33:27,466
I will definitely not show mercy

689
00:33:27,786 --> 00:33:28,667
and will punish him!

690
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:47,627
General.

691
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:48,867
It's really not my fault.

692
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:50,706
I didn't expect your charm
to be so great.

693
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:52,706
I won't do it again.

694
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:53,546
Xu Chengfeng!

695
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:55,026
- Who?
- Stop!

696
00:33:58,306 --> 00:33:58,947
Miss Du.

697
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,648
Tianhao, show some respect.

698
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:03,907
This is Danqing's friend,
not a stranger.

699
00:34:04,706 --> 00:34:06,466
You heartless man!

700
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,666
Miss Du, what do you mean?

701
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:11,506
You played with Danqing's affection.

702
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:12,936
I'm here to get even with her.

703
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:16,776
So

704
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:19,144
the word that you'll get married

705
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:21,947
is to stir up Danqing's emotions.

706
00:34:24,626 --> 00:34:26,186
It is not my original intention,

707
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,387
but it's also because Danqing
is reluctant to accept my love.

708
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,146
That's why I resorted to this bad way.

709
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:33,747
Yesterday, during the meal,

710
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:36,227
I could tell

711
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:40,106
the two of you
had a special relationship.

712
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:41,666
I guessed it right.

713
00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:43,307
Miss Du, you're discerning.

714
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:45,227
But could you please

715
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:47,506
put in a few good words
for me in front of Danqing?

716
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:50,626
You look not bad.

717
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:52,586
Since Danqing likes you,

718
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:53,947
I will make her happy.

719
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:56,666
But you.

720
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:00,907
If you do something to hurt her again,

721
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:02,307
I will not let you off!

722
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:04,907
You make it sound like

723
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,784
Danqing already knows now.

724
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:10,466
Of course, she knows.

725
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:13,347
When she heard you were getting married,

726
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,827
she was completely dazed.

727
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,026
The things in her hand
fell all over the floor.

728
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:21,066
She was in the silk shop,
her eyes brimming with tears.

729
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:22,387
It pained me to watch.

730
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,827
Danqing even cried?

731
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:27,466
Yes.

732
00:35:28,146 --> 00:35:29,387
She cried so sadly.

733
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:30,626
Her eyes were swollen.

734
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:32,186
That's why I asked her to go home

735
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:33,626
and came to confront you.

736
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:35,506
Her eyes were swollen.

737
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:39,546
Thank you very much, Miss Du.

738
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:40,827
I'll go to her home now.

739
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:42,472
Stay with her.

740
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:43,912
General!

741
00:35:44,387 --> 00:35:46,066
Actually, there's no need to rush.

742
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:47,787
He is very anxious.

743
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,907
(I seem to have exaggerated it a lot.)

744
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,026
(I'll apologize tonight.)

745
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:04,466
(What on earth is Xu Chengfeng up to?)

746
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:08,787
(Why is he suddenly going
to get married?)

747
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:15,986
What's this?

748
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:20,666
Why are you here?

749
00:36:26,787 --> 00:36:29,032
Not red or swollen at all.

750
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:33,347
What are you talking about?

751
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:34,626
What are you here for?

752
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:37,227
Stop pretending.

753
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:38,986
I already know.

754
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,506
K-K-Know what?

755
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:56,867
Your...

756
00:36:58,066 --> 00:36:58,728
secret.

757
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:01,736
My...

758
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:03,707
What are you talking about?

759
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:05,267
What secret can I have?

760
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,026
You're just being stubborn.

761
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:09,867
Did you cry your heart out
at the silk shop

762
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:11,586
when knowing I was getting married?

763
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:17,947
I didn't cry at all.

764
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:19,624
Okay.

765
00:37:21,026 --> 00:37:22,586
I'll say it again in front of you.

766
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:25,787
I'm getting married.

767
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:27,656
What...

768
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:29,466
do you think?

769
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:33,947
I don't know.

770
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:36,146
If the roles were reversed,

771
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:38,347
if it were me,

772
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,466
I would be heartbroken.

773
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:45,947
I'd take you away
from your wedding again.

774
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,347
whether you are willing or not.

775
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:03,848
Give it back.

776
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:06,120
So secret?

777
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:07,947
That really piques my curiosity.

778
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:09,256
Let me look.

779
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,186
Just a diary recording trivial matters

780
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:14,387
about our escort agency.

781
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:16,546
Chengfeng, aren't you

782
00:38:17,106 --> 00:38:17,827
getting married?

783
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:19,546
You still have time?

784
00:38:20,707 --> 00:38:21,747
Those are just rumors.

785
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:24,907
Zishan, I came
to discuss an important thing.

786
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:27,066
The minister replied to me.

787
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,146
As I expected, there are secrets

788
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:30,344
within the map.

789
00:38:31,146 --> 00:38:33,384
We need specially-made developing water
to decode it.

790
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:36,827
The treasure map
is related to the Luo family?

791
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:37,867
How can it be?

792
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,307
The map isn't related to the Luos.

793
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:43,227
Based on the clues I provided,
the minister found out

794
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:44,264
the water

795
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:46,827
might be related
to a reclusive collector

796
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,867
who had a connection
with the late Mr. Luo.

797
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:50,986
So the minister

798
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:53,707
thinks there was something fishy
behind the mysterious death

799
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:54,696
of Mr. Luo.

800
00:38:55,427 --> 00:38:56,907
He suspects Mr. Luo's death cause

801
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:58,506
wasn't internal.

802
00:38:58,827 --> 00:38:59,387
Impossible.

803
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,747
Danqing.

804
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,307
I know you were friends
with Miss Ailian.

805
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:05,546
It's inevitable to be worried
about her innocence.

806
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:08,146
But I believe it has nothing
to do with the Luos.

807
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,387
If you are feeling bad,

808
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:11,867
you can go back to your room.

809
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:14,427
Leave us two to discuss.

810
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,267
Let Danqing say whatever she wants to.

811
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,106
They were good friends,

812
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:22,387
so she knows some things we don't.

813
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:26,267
I know

814
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:28,267
Luo Ailian was not one to deceive,

815
00:39:28,586 --> 00:39:30,907
so her family would not engage in

816
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:32,328
any disgraceful matters.

817
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:33,096
Alright.

818
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:34,666
Just the minister's suspicion.

819
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:35,947
It's not confirmed yet.

820
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:39,947
Luo Ailian died with a false accusation.

821
00:39:41,307 --> 00:39:42,106
If she were still alive,

822
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:45,666
she would surely not want
her father to be suspected

823
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:47,347
or criticized.

824
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:50,867
Danqing means...

825
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,066
I trust the Luos.

826
00:39:57,546 --> 00:39:57,947
Danqing,

827
00:39:58,947 --> 00:39:59,867
you trust the Luos so much

828
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:02,626
just because you
and Luo Ailian were good friends?

829
00:40:04,546 --> 00:40:06,267
Well, if it were me,

830
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:07,307
I'd trust her too.

831
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:10,466
Moreover,
it's just the minister's speculation.

832
00:40:12,186 --> 00:40:13,227
If they were really involved,

833
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:14,947
he'd already ask me to look into it.

834
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,427
That makes sense.

835
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:18,267
Since we now have a definite clue,

836
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,347
we should find this collector
as soon as possible.

837
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:21,832
That's right.

838
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:23,186
It's just a pity

839
00:40:24,146 --> 00:40:26,146
that we have no idea
where the collector is.

840
00:40:26,626 --> 00:40:28,307
Moreover, we can only find two Luos,

841
00:40:29,106 --> 00:40:30,387
Luo Xue'er and Ms. Zhou.

842
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:32,747
They may not tell us the truth.

843
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:33,960
Chengfeng,

844
00:40:34,387 --> 00:40:35,506
do you have any other clues

845
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:36,586
about the collector?

846
00:40:38,387 --> 00:40:39,307
We only know now

847
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:40,947
that the collector's surname is Ouyang

848
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:42,026
and he loves wine.

849
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,106
Zishan, you've been to many places.

850
00:40:44,747 --> 00:40:45,512
Have you heard of him?

851
00:40:46,787 --> 00:40:48,387
There are quite a few people
with the surname,

852
00:40:48,387 --> 00:40:50,186
but I haven't noticed any collectors.

853
00:40:51,387 --> 00:40:52,066
How about this?

854
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:54,186
Tomorrow morning, some of my men
will leave the city to inquire.

855
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,520
Even without the Luo family,
we can still find it.

856
00:40:57,307 --> 00:40:58,827
Alright, I shall take my leave

857
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:01,288
to see if Tianhao make any new findings.

858
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:04,986
Danqing, sorry for my words just now.

859
00:41:05,626 --> 00:41:06,787
I forgot you two were friends.

860
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,072
I'm sorry.

861
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:16,026
Danqing.

862
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:19,227
I want to ask him something.

863
00:41:19,626 --> 00:41:21,586
Calm down. You will give yourself away.

864
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:22,626
Take it slow.

865
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,066
Don't worry, Zishan. I know what to do.

866
00:41:32,466 --> 00:41:34,707
I really don't want you to get hurt.

867
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:37,347
General Xu.

868
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:42,626
What's it?

869
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:45,787
Anything else?

870
00:41:48,626 --> 00:41:49,506
You just said

871
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:51,586
you'd believe Luo Ailian too.

872
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:52,827
Why?

873
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:58,506
How should I put it?

874
00:42:00,106 --> 00:42:01,546
If there must be a reason,

875
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:02,888
her eyes.

00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:05,026

00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:08,872
I remember her eyes.

879
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:11,026
The look in her eyes

880
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:12,787
was honest, so it was

881
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:14,387
