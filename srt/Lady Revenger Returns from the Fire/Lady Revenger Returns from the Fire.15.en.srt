00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,184
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:24,242
Danqing.

4
00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:25,642
Don't stop me.

5
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:27,563
If you are going to Prince Yi,

6
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:28,923
I will go with you.

7
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,683
I can't let you face danger alone.

8
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:35,683
But I have to tell you.

9
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:37,123
Even if we find him

10
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:38,282
and perish with him,

11
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:40,323
I don't think
we can get the rest of the antidote.

12
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:42,603
I believe you've thought of this.

13
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:45,563
But we can't do nothing

14
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,242
and watch Zishan become half-dead.

15
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:49,242
At least I can find Prince Yi

16
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:50,802
and get something out of him.

17
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:54,203
In the imperial court,

18
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:55,882
I've battled
with Prince Yi several times

19
00:01:56,162 --> 00:01:57,362
without gaining any advantage.

20
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:00,242
Even if we're not afraid
of his royal status,

21
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:02,002
his cunning schemes are difficult

22
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,403
for most people to deal with.

23
00:02:05,162 --> 00:02:06,082
Zishan is in grave danger.

24
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:08,003
I know we must get the other half
of the antidote.

25
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:10,203
But with his life at stake,

26
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:12,082
we have to

27
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:13,362
make a detailed plan.

28
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:18,603
What should we do?

29
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:23,802
Zishan is still very weak.

30
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:27,122
Danqing, you stay
and take good care of him.

31
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:29,763
I will go and see
if there are any clues we missed.

32
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:36,962
But Zishan has less than a day to live.

33
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,603
Don't put it like that.

34
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:40,763
Fortunately,

35
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:42,723
we still have one day.

36
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:04,962
(Prince Yi's Mansion)

37
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:06,842
(You are foresighted and thoughtful.)

38
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:09,443
Things have happened as you predicted.

39
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:11,682
There's one thing I don't understand.

40
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:14,163
What is it?

41
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:16,323
Since we've taken back the crossbow,

42
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:17,723
and the evidence has been destroyed,

43
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:19,883
why did you still
give out the half-dose antidote,

44
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:21,122
keeping Shen Zishan alive?

45
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:22,802
Why didn't you give him a fake antidote

46
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:24,043
and let him die?

47
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:27,122
When the enemies are in desperate times,
don't push them too hard.

48
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,003
So you mean

49
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:33,402
if we push them into a corner,

50
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:36,362
it'll trigger their desperate desire
to fight back?

51
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:40,362
Now Xu Chengfeng and the Shen family

52
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:42,483
know that I have the treasure map.

53
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,122
Shen Zishan is barely alive.

54
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:49,362
So they will become more afraid of us.

55
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,483
In case he dies,

56
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:53,122
they will definitely fight desperately

57
00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:54,883
and try to incriminate me
to His Majesty.

58
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,923
Even if they have no solid evidence,

59
00:03:56,923 --> 00:03:58,883
it's hard to avoid arousing suspicion.

60
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:01,362
Shen Zishan is half-dead,

61
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,242
making Xu Chengfeng and Shen Danqing

62
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:06,203
hesitate to take action.

63
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:07,962
You are wise.

64
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:11,283
Considering the evidence they hold now,

65
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:14,723
they probably don't know the secret
behind the treasure map.

66
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,723
Apart from the treasure map,

67
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:19,043
the method to decipher it is a must.

68
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,802
Then the location
of the treasure will be revealed.

69
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:22,762
Yes.

70
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:24,682
The treasure map is in our hands,

71
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,403
and you always maintain the initiative.

72
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,122
We have the treasure map.

73
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:31,242
Yet we haven't figured out its secret.

74
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,083
So we must be more cautious.

75
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,163
We can't force them too hard.

76
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:36,963
You are indeed thoughtful.

77
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:38,843
I didn't think of this at all.

78
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,442
To my surprise,

79
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:43,283
Xu Chengfeng is so good to Shen Zishan.

80
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,762
Xu Chengfeng
values his friend Shen Zishan.

81
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:51,083
But what he cares about even more
is Shen Danqing.

82
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:54,322
Yes, Lv Zhu mentioned to us

83
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:57,603
that Xu Chengfeng seems
to care a lot about Shen Danqing.

84
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,442
The two came together yesterday.

85
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:00,603
I guess they have a thing.

86
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:02,682
Judging from yesterday,

87
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:05,682
Xu Chengfeng cares about Shen Danqing

88
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,403
more than he ever thought.

89
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:09,923
In this case,

90
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:12,122
having a hold on Shen Zishan

91
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:14,002
means having a hold on Shen Danqing.

92
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:15,603
And having a hold on Shen Danqing

93
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:17,362
means controlling Xu Chengfeng.

94
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,122
That's right.

95
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:21,483
So Shen Zishan absolutely cannot die.

96
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:24,002
But we cannot let him live too well

97
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,322
and trouble us.

98
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:27,043
It's best

99
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:29,122
for him to live in agony.

100
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,403
You are wise.

101
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:33,682
If things go well,

102
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:35,283
the rest of the antidote

103
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:37,723
could protect us.

104
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:40,083
You mean...

105
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:44,403
Things are getting more
and more interesting.

106
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:53,083
He's taken half a dose of the antidote

107
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:54,403
to make him survive.

108
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,762
Why is he suffering so much in the coma?

109
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:00,163
The half-dose antidote
helps him survive,

110
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:02,963
but it cannot

111
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,882
suppress the excruciating pain caused
by the poison.

112
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,523
Zishan is in a coma,

113
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,562
but he's still suffering.

114
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:11,603
Is there a way to relieve it?

115
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:25,762
Zishan.

116
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:28,362
Do you remember

117
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:30,723
how you saved me?

118
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,362

122

Zishan, how come you're here?

00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:41,643
I want you

187
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:43,643
to marry me as my concubine.

188
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:46,682
What?

189
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:48,802
I have taken a liking to you.

190
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:52,363
I want you to be by my side every day

191
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:54,602
to attend to me.

192
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:04,082
I am always patient.

193
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:05,682
I give you one day to think about it.

194
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,283
If by tomorrow morning

195
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:09,043
I don't receive your refusal,

196
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,043
I'll take it as a yes.

197
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:28,482
I finally understand

198
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:30,163
why the rest of the antidote
can protect us.

199
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,123
When you gave them
the half dose of the antidote,

200
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,802
you anticipated
that Shen Danqing would come, right?

201
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,003
Yeah, you've made progress.

202
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:41,842
With the half-dose antidote,
we've controlled the Shen family

203
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,523
and Xu Chengfeng

204
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,842
and made Shen Danqing one of us.

205
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:49,322
Thus we will thoroughly control them.

206
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:51,722
You are foresighted. I'm so impressed.

207
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:56,202
Xu Chengfeng
and the Shen siblings are capable.

208
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:58,763
If they had worked
with me from the beginning,

209
00:11:58,763 --> 00:11:59,923
wouldn't everyone be happy?

210
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,482
But they are over-confident.

211
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:06,442
However,

212
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:08,442
after coming to Liao City,

213
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,842
I get a beautiful concubine

214
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:13,163
to coerce Xu Chengfeng.

215
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:15,082
It's a good result.

216
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,482
(Has General Xu found the antidote?)

217
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,322
(Why hasn't he returned yet?)

218
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:36,442
Danqing.

219
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:39,442
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,283
That's all right.

221
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:49,123
I don't blame you.

222
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:55,962
Your wound has gaped.

223
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:03,602
You have told me

224
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:05,482
about Prince Yi.

225
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:07,523
He's sly and calculating

226
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:10,202
with extreme strategic acumen.

227
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:12,643
How could it be possible

228
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:14,482
to find the antidote so easily?

229
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,682
You have already done your best.

230
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,520
(Chengfeng Wine)

231
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,403
I thought it all depends on effort.

232
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,363
As long as I want to do it,

233
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,962
I can certainly achieve it.

234
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,082
But this time,

235
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:52,962
it seems

236
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:56,243
I can't do it.

237
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,322
We are human, not gods.

238
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:25,523
How could it be possible

239
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,202
that everything goes as one wishes

240
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:31,003
and everything is perfect?

241
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:34,003
Everyone calls me a god of war,

242
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,363
praising me for my bravery in battle.

243
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:42,442
But I also feel scared sometimes.

244
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:55,283
What I fear is not the enemy,

245
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:58,403
not the blood and death
on the battlefield,

246
00:16:02,523 --> 00:16:04,722
but those soldiers who died in battle.

247
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,442
You said the wounds mean honors.

248
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:15,784
At least they can heal.

249
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:18,722
But what about those soldiers?

250
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:22,043
They were all so young,

251
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,802
but they could never come back.

252
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:38,802
I couldn't protect them
on the battlefield.

253
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:41,722
I thought that off the battlefield,

254
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:43,883
I could protect others.

255
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:46,082
But I still couldn't do it.

256
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:47,442
Know-it-all,

257
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:49,442
Lv Zhu,

258
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:53,482
and Zishan.

259
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:57,523
I can't protect the people around me.

260
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:02,442
But you have always been protecting me.

261
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:06,282
I will always remember.

262
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:15,803
Weird.

263
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:19,643
Your gaze reminds me of someone I know.

264
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:24,643
It's a girl.

265
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,282
Her name is Luo Ailian.

266
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:35,923
What happened to her?

267
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,403
It's also because of me.

268
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:40,242
I didn't rescue her in time,

269
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,482

Your Highness,
you got up early for this.

308
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:00,923
Is Shen Danqing important enough

309
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:02,883
to deserve your considerable efforts?

310
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,042
You could've simply sent a sedan chair
to fetch her.

312

00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,482
Shen Danqing is marrying Prince Yi.

340
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:20,843
Get her here.

341
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,563
How is that possible?

342
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,042

344
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:27,442

345

You are abducting a civilian.

346
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,962
No, if you want to take Miss Shen away,

347
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,643

348
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:35,282
I like tough women.

349
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,403

350
00:23:38,803 --> 00:23:40,923
come with her to my place.

367

00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,563
will I wear a smile.

372
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:46,923
You're not the one
I sincerely wish to marry.

373
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:49,442
I really can't force myself to laugh.

374
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:54,643
But don't worry, Your Highness.

375
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,522
I will not commit suicide

376
00:24:56,722 --> 00:24:57,843
with hatred.

377
00:24:58,643 --> 00:24:59,563
If I must die,

378
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,442
I will take my enemies down

379
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,482
with me.

380
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:15,522
I used to raise a tigress.

381
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,202
At first, she was much fiercer than you.

382
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:21,282
She almost bit off Zong Wei's arm.

383
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,722
But since I pulled out her sharp teeth

384
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:27,603
one by one,

385
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:30,482
she's become even tamer than a kitten.

386
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,163
What I like is

387
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,563
to tame.

388
00:25:36,563 --> 00:25:38,442
Don't delay the time
for the wedding ceremony.

389
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,403
It's time to get in the litter.

390
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:43,282
My bride.

391
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:49,442
Miss, you can't go.

392
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:52,282
Please.

393
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:00,202
Miss.

394
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:01,363
- Miss.
- Miss.

395
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:02,083
Miss.

396
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:03,603
Miss...

397
00:26:06,163 --> 00:26:07,042
Stay.

398
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:09,682
Take good care of my brother.

399
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:12,083
When I get married,

400
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:14,083
the antidote will be delivered.

401
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:15,563
Tell him

402
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:17,762
to stay alive and well.

403
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:18,762
Miss!

404
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:19,843
Miss.

405
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,083
Miss!

406
00:26:26,522 --> 00:26:27,202
Miss!

407
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:29,323
Miss!

408
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:49,403
Halt! How dare you break in?

409
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,442
(General's Mansion)
I am looking for General Xu.

410
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,163
General Xu and deputy general Tianhao
have gone out.

411
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:54,603
What are you here for?

412
00:26:56,403 --> 00:26:59,083
Miss Shen is marrying Prince Yi
in exchange for the antidote

413
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,202
for her brother.

414
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:01,803
In Liao City,

415
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,522
only General Xu can stop Prince Yi.

416
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:04,883
When General Xu returns,

417
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:06,123
I will report to him myself.

418
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:07,403
You may go back.

419
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:08,962
Thank you.

420
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,168
(General's Mansion)

421
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,072
(Prince Yi's Mansion)

422
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:50,123
Miss.

423
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:52,962
According to tradition,

424
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,442
a concubine has no wedding ceremony

425
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:56,002
and cannot go through the main gate.

426
00:27:56,202 --> 00:27:58,442
His Highness values your family.

427
00:27:58,923 --> 00:28:01,482
Thus, you're granted
the ceremony of a wife.

428
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,603
Miss, you should be thankful.

429
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:06,442
Shen Danqing.

430
00:28:06,923 --> 00:28:07,962
Before going through the gate,

431
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,083
I allow you to change your mind.

432
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:11,803
If you want to leave now,

433
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:14,482
I will definitely not stop you.

434
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:35,803
I get to marry
such a beautiful concubine.

435
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:38,282
It makes others envious.

436
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:40,242
If General Xu knows about it,

437
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:41,803
how will he feel?

438
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:43,643
I guess

439
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:46,083
he will be jealous of me.

440
00:29:13,923 --> 00:29:15,722
I object!

441
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:44,563
Zong Wei, do not be disrespectful
to General Xu.

442
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:45,803
Put down the sword.

443
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:50,083
Put it down!

444
00:29:52,762 --> 00:29:54,923
General Xu, you received the news
quite quickly.

445
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:57,042
Are you eager to come

446
00:29:57,242 --> 00:29:58,762
to drink the wedding wine?

447
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:01,083
After the ceremony,

448
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:03,282
let's get hammered.

449
00:30:03,643 --> 00:30:05,042
I am not here for that.

450
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:08,083
I am here to take her away.

451
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:11,323
Are you serious?

452
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,002
She is here of her own accord.

453
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:16,123
Who are you to take her away?

454
00:30:16,643 --> 00:30:18,923
Danqing is unwilling to marry you.

455
00:30:23,242 --> 00:30:25,803
My bride, tell him.

456
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:30,042
Are you willing to marry me
as a concubine?

457
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:34,163
You should go.

458
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:35,643
You...

459
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:36,923
General, stop.

460
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:39,363
Xu Chengfeng, how dare you.

461
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,682
You attempt
to kill His Highness in public?

462
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,363
In public?

463
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:46,123
You forced a woman to be your concubine,
disregarding the law.

464
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:47,762
I cannot sit by and do nothing.

465
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:49,042
I will

466
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:50,722
take on any consequences myself.

467
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:51,962
Xu Chengfeng...

468
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:55,163
Order your men to back off.

469
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,323
Back off!

470
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:01,482
Put the sword down.

471
00:31:17,282 --> 00:31:18,682
I haven't obtained the antidote yet.

472
00:31:19,682 --> 00:31:20,843
Don't be afraid. I am with you.

473
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:23,083
I have my ways to get the antidote.

474
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:28,202
Xu Chengfeng, for this woman,

475
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,762
you're openly against me.

476
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,123
Have you thought of the consequences?

477
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:33,123
I don't care.

478
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:34,643
I have told you.

479
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:36,923
I forbid this marriage.

480
00:31:37,722 --> 00:31:38,083
Let's go.

481
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:47,482
Your Highness.

482
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:54,923
Giddy up.

483
00:31:55,923 --> 00:31:56,803
Protect His Highness.

484
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:57,843
After them!

485
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:30,202
Giddy up!

486
00:32:31,522 --> 00:32:32,323
Giddy up!

487
00:32:54,603 --> 00:32:56,563
Prince Yi held a wedding
with great fanfare

488
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:57,962
just to provoke me.

489
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,603
But I guess he did not anticipate

490
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:01,962
I'd come to snatch the bride.

491
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:04,323
Those who offend His Highness
don't deserve to live.

492
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,563
You should be thankful
to be alive today.

493
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:08,643
You want my life?

494
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:10,603
It depends on
whether you have it in you.

495
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:11,643
Attack!

496
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:02,682
Let's go.

497
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:05,042
Giddy up!

498
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:06,163
Giddy up!

499
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:14,082
Your Highness.

500
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:15,923
Has Zong Wei not returned yet?

501
00:34:16,683 --> 00:34:17,243
Not yet.

502
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:18,562
Keep looking.

503
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:20,642
When you find him, give my command.

504
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:22,482
If he failed, he must retreat

505
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:24,203
in case it alerts His Majesty

506
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:25,683
and cause trouble.

507
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:27,562
It's not worth it.

508
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:28,803
Yes.

509
00:34:43,243 --> 00:34:43,683
Are you okay?

510
00:34:44,602 --> 00:34:46,122
I'm fine. Just a minor injury.

511
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:48,442
Let me have a look.

512
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:50,283
General.

513
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,642
Rest assured,
I won't look what I shouldn't.

514
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:55,602
I will take responsibility.

515
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:57,323
General, it's inappropriate.

516
00:34:57,923 --> 00:34:58,442
Let go.

517
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:04,723
This is a lotus flower.

518
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:09,283
I was injured before.

519
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:10,683
It looked ugly.

520
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:12,082
So I cover it with a lotus tattoo.

521
00:35:17,122 --> 00:35:18,042
Bear with it.

522
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:28,962
I'm gonna apply it.

523
00:36:13,162 --> 00:36:14,323
How's your hand?

524
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,002
Does it still hurt?

525
00:36:19,883 --> 00:36:21,683
Why are you suddenly sulking?

526
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:25,962
Why are you glaring at me?

527
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,843
Do you really not trust me?

528
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:31,122
Zishan is hanging by a thread,
and we're both anxious.

529
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:32,763
Why didn't you tell me about it?

530
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:35,082
You almost married Prince Yi
for the antidote.

531
00:36:35,442 --> 00:36:37,683
Shen Danqing,
do you know how scared I was?

532
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:39,923
Why are you yelling at me?

533
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,283
Do you think I'm not afraid?

534
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,363
Do you think I'm happy?

535
00:36:42,522 --> 00:36:43,923
Do you think I'm willing to marry him?

536
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:47,002
Zishan is in grave danger.

537
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:48,683
He is about to lose his life.

538
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:50,442
How could I discuss it with you?

539
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:55,082
I won't marry Prince Yi.

540
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:56,683
As long as he hands over the antidote,

541
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,203
I will die with him.

542
00:37:00,763 --> 00:37:02,042
I just want my brother to live.

543
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:11,803
I'm sorry.

544
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:14,803
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

545
00:37:15,562 --> 00:37:17,082
I should have told you
my deduction earlier.

546
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:19,602
I have never been so scared.

547
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:22,683
I just didn't expect Prince Yi
to be so despicable.

548
00:37:24,602 --> 00:37:25,442
And I didn't expect

549
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:26,883
you to be so stupid.

550
00:37:28,323 --> 00:37:29,522
I didn't want to drag you down.

551
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:31,723
But I didn't expect

552
00:37:32,763 --> 00:37:33,923
you to come to stop the wedding.

553
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:37,122
I'm sorry.

554
00:37:42,562 --> 00:37:43,283
Alright.

555
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,323
Don't cry.

556
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:50,642
So,

557
00:37:52,243 --> 00:37:53,803
how did you get the antidote?

558
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:03,763
Give it to me.

559
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,002
The antidote is really here.

560
00:38:14,522 --> 00:38:15,442
How did you guess?

561
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:16,602
You even came back here.

562
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:17,962
I thought of it afterward.

563
00:38:18,723 --> 00:38:20,482
Zong Wei knew
we were desperate to get the antidote.

564
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:21,723
So

565
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:24,442
he rushed over to move the antidote
after hastily killing Lv Zhu.

566
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:25,522
But he was also afraid

567
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,082
we would come to take the antidote.

568
00:38:27,602 --> 00:38:28,843
To ensure nothing goes wrong,

569
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:30,162
he detonated the explosives.

570
00:38:30,162 --> 00:38:31,203
After we left,

571
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:32,562
he sent someone to fetch it at night.

572
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:33,602
It is safer.

573
00:38:34,082 --> 00:38:37,162
So you anticipated
Zong Wei's prediction,

574
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:39,042
catching him off guard.

575
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:41,482
Impressive.

576
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,803
(This is the whole story.)

577
00:38:47,363 --> 00:38:48,803
I didn't expect that after sobering up,

578
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:51,042
you would go to the pharmacy.

579
00:38:51,522 --> 00:38:52,042
Yeah.

580
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:54,283
I had an intuition after I sobered up.

581
00:38:54,803 --> 00:38:56,723
The most dangerous place
might just be the safest.

582
00:38:57,522 --> 00:38:58,962
The antidote might still be there.

583
00:39:00,562 --> 00:39:02,803
Perhaps I deserved to get the antidote.

584
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:04,763
If I hadn't drunk with you,

585
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:06,283
I wouldn't have found it.

586
00:39:08,642 --> 00:39:10,203
(He was drunk last night.)

587
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,363
(He probably doesn't
remember what happened.)

588
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:19,522
If you figured it out,

589
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:21,403
why didn't you tell me?

590
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:22,962
I just made a guess.

591
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:24,403
If I had told you

592
00:39:24,602 --> 00:39:25,723
but failed to find the antidote,

593
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:27,042
I would have given you false hope.

594
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:33,602
How would I know you drank
to drown your sorrows last night

595
00:39:33,883 --> 00:39:35,482
only to marry Prince Yi

596
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:37,403
as his concubine for the antidote today?

597
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:38,803
At that time,

598
00:39:39,082 --> 00:39:40,843
I was still not sober.

599
00:39:43,082 --> 00:39:43,528
I...

600
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:47,203
I told you. I had no choice.

601
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:48,283
Besides,

602
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:50,283
you've vented your anger.

603
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:51,602
Can't you let it go?

604
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:55,403
What?

605
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:57,082
How would I know you would get so angry?

606
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,042
Why are you looking at me?

607
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:10,283
Do you really not know?

608
00:40:10,923 --> 00:40:11,763
Or are you pretending?

609
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:15,203
Know what?

610
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:16,723
I care about you.

611
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:26,763
Well, we are friends.

612
00:40:27,363 --> 00:40:28,403
You helped me today.

613
00:40:28,403 --> 00:40:29,363
I don't even know

614
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:30,843
how to repay you.

615
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:33,442
Right.

616
00:40:34,323 --> 00:40:35,522
How do you repay me?

617
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:36,923
Between you and me,

618
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:38,522
you got injured and bled for me,

619
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:39,723
and I dressed your wounds.

620
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:42,562
