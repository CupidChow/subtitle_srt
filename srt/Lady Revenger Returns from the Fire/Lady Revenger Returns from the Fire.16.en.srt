=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,344
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:24,706
Between you and me,

4
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,667
you got hurt and bled for me,

5
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,187
and I dressed your wounds.

6
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:30,866
Does that mean
it's time for us to marry?

7
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:36,987
I

8
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:39,786
was just joking.

9
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:41,946
Don't take it seriously.

10
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:50,627
I pretended to be your wife.

11
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:51,267
We

12
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:53,786
are even now.

13
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,187
But I said

14
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,306
I'd take responsibility.

15
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:03,451
It wasn't a joke.

16
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:15,972
It seems we're safe now.

17
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:18,051
This is the secret signal
Tianhao and I use.

18
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:20,171
I'll take you back in a bit.

19
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:37,192
(Shen Mansion)

20
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:45,731
Thank you for today, General Xu.

21
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:48,252
My family will never forget.

22
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:51,291
No need for such formalities between us.

23
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:58,731
Danqing,

24
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,331
I have a question.

25
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,412
It might be inappropriate,

26
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,451
but I...

27
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:09,891
Please, go ahead.

28
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:11,852
Last night,

29
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:14,051
the two of us were
drinking in the garden.

30
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:15,532
I got drunk.

31
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:16,652
Did we...?

32
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:17,932
General, you remember it wrong.

33
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:21,812
Last night, it was you
drinking alone in the garden.

34
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,252
Alone?

35
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:24,611
- But...
- I...

36
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,011
I'm really worried about my brother.

37
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,932
Let's talk about this another day.

38
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:30,451
Danqing.

39
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,051
Danqing.

40
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:33,852
Danqing.

41
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:43,532
Alone?

42
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:46,051
Do I really remember it wrong?

43
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:51,011
(I don't know how much
he can recall from that night,)

44
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:52,611
(but no matter what,)

45
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,331
(he mustn't know I am Luo Ailian.)

46
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:58,372
(I better avoid him for a few days.)

47
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:08,571
My lady, you've returned.

48
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:14,531
The young master took the antidote
brought back by the general

49
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:15,371
and woke up.

50
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:17,771
But Mr. Miao says

51
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:20,091
the poison is very fierce.

52
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:21,971
He still needs to take medicine on time

53
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:25,211
to expel the remaining toxins
and restore himself to full health.

54
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:26,851
Place the medicine here.

55
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:27,971
I will take care of him.

56
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:42,812
Danqing.

57
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,252
Zishan, you've woken up.

58
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:47,812
Don't sit up.

59
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,132
Just get plenty of rest.

60
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:57,531
Danqing.

61
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:03,692
I know the consequences
of what I've done are very serious.

62
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:06,171
But the toxic residue
in your body is not cleared.

63
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,012
You can admonish me

64
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:10,971
after you recover.

65
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:20,971
I once asked you
to abandon your vengeance.

66
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:22,971
But you were firm

67
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,372
and never gave up.

68
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:26,411
And now,

69
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:29,492
you disregarded your revenge plans,

70
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:31,291
took risks for me,

71
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,731
and even sacrificed yourself

72
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:34,892
to get the antidote for me.

73
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:37,812
I'm grateful

74
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:40,091
for such a huge favor.

75
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,531
How could I possibly blame you?

76
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,771
The general found the antidote.

77
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:49,892
I didn't do much.

78
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:53,052
Let alone the favor.

79
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,892
My life was given by you.

80
00:05:57,971 --> 00:05:59,052
I will always remember.

81
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:00,771
Without you,

82
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:02,531
I wouldn't be who I am today.

83
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:04,211
I should be thanking you.

84
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:09,132
What's wrong?

85
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,291
I'll go get Mr. Miao.

86
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:11,144
I'm fine.

87
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,091
I could have caught

88
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,492
the culprit who harmed you

89
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:18,568
by using the crossbow as evidence,

90
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:20,411
but I messed it up.

91
00:06:22,572 --> 00:06:23,692
The frustration eats me up.

92
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,812
We can still search for more evidence.

93
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,651
Anything leaves traces.

94
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:30,531
They must have made other slip-ups.

95
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,331
At least now we know

96
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,531
who the real culprit is.

97
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,812
What we need to do now is...

98
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:41,171
What we can do now

99
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,612
is that you hurry up
and take your medicine.

100
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:47,331
Okay, I'll listen to you.

101
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:35,531
(Between you and me,)

102
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:37,012
(you got hurt and bled for me,)

103
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:38,372
(and I dressed your wounds.)

104
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:40,771
Does that mean
it's time for us to marry?

105
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,211
(I even asked her to marry me.)

106
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:52,812
(Isn't that being too hasty?)

107
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:57,132
General.

108
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:00,692
What brings you here late at night?

109
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,572
I made this chicken soup for you.

110
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,211
It will help your wounds heal faster.

111
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:05,892
Thank you.

112
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:13,411
Tianhao,

113
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:15,012
you've followed me for years.

114
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,651
What do you think of me?

115
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,052
Your valor is undisputed.

116
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:21,572
Whether on the battlefield

117
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:22,692
or in the yamen,

118
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:24,572
no one can rival...

119
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:27,291
That's not what I meant.

120
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:28,932
Then what do you mean, General?

121
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:34,092
I mean in terms of personality,
family background,

122
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:36,612
appearance and such

123
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:40,252
You are a general
appointed by the Emperor.

124
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:41,691
You come from a good family

125
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,012
and look somewhat good.

126
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:45,531
Somewhat?

127
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:47,771
Just somewhat good?

128
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:51,651
Since when have you
cared about appearances?

129
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:54,252
Continue.

130
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:58,092
As for...

131
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,691
As for your personality,

132
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:02,451
in a word,

133
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:04,372
amazing.

134
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:08,132
You got some nerve.

135
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:12,092
General,

136
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,051
you were so heroic
when saving her today.

137
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,132
Did Miss Shen fall for your charm?

138
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:18,892
Of course.

139
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:20,332
Such a great favor.

140
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:21,972
Did Miss Shen say
how she would repay it?

141
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:23,411
Would she devote herself to you?

142
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:25,451
Of course...

143
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,771
Of course she didn't say that.

144
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:34,451
I thought so.

145
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:35,972
What?

146
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:37,811
General, think about

147
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:39,931
how you met Miss Shen.

148
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:41,892
The first time,

149
00:09:42,852 --> 00:09:44,252
you suspected her
of being a female bandit

150
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:46,092
and had her serve you tea.

151
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:47,132
Miss Shen.

152
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:48,892
Is that okay?

153
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:52,892
The second time, it was impressive.

154
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:54,291
To feel her out,

155
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:55,771
you threw her into the water.

156
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:02,051
The third time,
it was even more terrible.

157
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,492
Miss Shen was forced
to reconstruct the scene

158
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:06,252
and got involved
in your fight with the bandit.

159
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:07,372
(She was even injured.)

160
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,171
If you were Miss Shen,

161
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,492
would you think of marrying you?

162
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:18,212
Besides, Miss Shen

163
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:19,571
has an elder brother

164
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,051
who is gentle and cultivated.

165
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,092
Comparing with others can be maddening.

166
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:28,212
To put it this way, if it were me

167
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:30,171
having to choose between you two

168
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:31,651
and I wasn't blind,

169
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:32,852
I'd definitely choose Mr. Shen.

170
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:35,012
That doesn't make sense.

171
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:37,451
Zishan

172
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:39,492
is not bad,

173
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:40,332
but his temperament

174
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,012
may not be suitable

175
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:43,651
for Miss Shen.

176
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:46,092
Danqing is a different kind of woman.

177
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:47,771
Only an extraordinary man

178
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:49,771
like me is worthy of her.

179
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,771
You don't like to take the common path,

180
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:54,171
but you and Miss Shen are poles apart.

181
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:57,051
If you could come together,
that would be strange.

182
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:58,212
If you don't believe it, try.

183
00:10:58,332 --> 00:10:59,332
I'll give it a try.

184
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:02,811
If two moving in opposite ways
can come together,

185
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:04,811
it'll show Miss Shen and I are fated.

186
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:08,291
I have never lost on the battlefield,

187
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:11,012
so naturally, I won't lose
in the arena of love.

188
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,171
Give it a try.

189
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:18,492
(Gentle and cultured.)

190
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:28,691
I forbid this marriage.

191
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:45,571
(Can't believe)

192
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:48,132
(he would do that for me.)

193
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:51,771
What are you thinking about?

194
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:53,132
Smiling so sweetly.

195
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:55,612
Nothing much.

196
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:57,352
Shuixian,

197
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:00,531
how has Luo Xue'er been recently?

198
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,408
She's being watched by Mr. Luo.

199
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:04,771
She refused to confess,

200
00:12:05,012 --> 00:12:06,012
so she paid the price.

201
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:08,972
I heard she's now
no different from a beggar.

202
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:12,732
I estimate she won't last much longer.

203
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:15,691
(After Luo Xue'er confesses)

204
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,012
(and I clear my name)

205
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,771
(and avenge my father and Bin,)

206
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,732
(whether I'm Luo Ailian)

207
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,691
(or Shen Danqing,)

208
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:28,771
(I can then be myself
without any concerns.)

209
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:32,072
Rice cake.

210
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,931
Take a look at the rice cake.

211
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:39,252
Go away. Don't disturb my business.

212
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,092
You're too poor to buy rice cake.

213
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:42,332
Go somewhere else.

214
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,492
I'm going.

215
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:44,571
Please come again.

216
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:45,492
Come look at the rice cake.

217
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,451
Don't come. Go away.

218
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:49,531
Do you even have money?

219
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:51,372
Get lost!

220
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:54,252
Sesame crisp cake.

221
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:56,451
Crisp cake.

222
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:31,651
You're getting better
faster than I thought.

223
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:32,892
Danqing

224
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:34,792
has been tirelessly taking care of me.

225
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:39,012
I heard

226
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,411
when I was poisoned,

227
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,852
my relationship with her
was almost exposed.

228
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:47,571
In order to deceive General Xu,

229
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,171
I had no choice but to say

230
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:50,972
she was your sworn sister.

231
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:56,291
Although it was a fluke,

232
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:59,012
it inadvertently dissolved
our sibling relationship.

233
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:01,332
Honestly speaking,

234
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:03,492
I actually feel fortunate.

235
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:05,132
I guess

236
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,212
this is an opportunity
given to me by God,

237
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:10,051
allowing me to freely pursue my love.

238
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:14,612
I can feel the change
in your attitude towards her,

239
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:16,051
but I didn't realize

240
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:17,612
it had already reached this extent.

241
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:21,811
It seems
that even the most restrained person

242
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,332
may find their feelings

243
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:26,972
uncontrollable in the face of true love.

244
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,051
Among the women I've met,

245
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:30,931
she is the most unique one.

246
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:33,492
She's not only pure and gracious

247
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:35,291
but also brave and resourceful.

248
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,092
I've long been unable

249
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,252
to treat her as my sister.

250
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,012
Anyway,

251
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:45,771
I want to take this opportunity

252
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:47,291
and tell her my feelings.

253
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:50,612
The temple fair in a few days

254
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:53,811
is probably a good opportunity.

255
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,451
Zishan, Danqing.

256
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:11,771
Zishan, are you getting better?

257
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:14,531
Yes, thanks to your antidote

258
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:15,880
and Danqing's care.

259
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:21,492
Zishan, I have come today
to discuss an important matter.

260
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:25,051
When Danqing and I went
to Prince Yi to get the antidote,

261
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:26,252
Prince Yi seemed

262
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:28,252
to be looking for clues
from the case files

263
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:29,252
we were investigating.

264
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:32,012
He already has the treasure map.

265
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:34,092
What other clues does he want?

266
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:35,771
I have the same question.

267
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:37,972
Prince Yi got the treasure map,

268
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:39,771
but he didn't start the treasure hunt.

269
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,972
Instead, he stayed here
and kept an eye on us.

270
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:43,852
So, I speculate

271
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:45,852
perhaps there is more
to the treasure map.

272
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:49,732
He probably hasn't found
the location of the treasure yet.

273
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:51,372
If that's true,

274
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:52,811
first, he wants

275
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,531
to stop you from finding out about him,

276
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:58,132
and second, he's trying to
decipher the treasure map's secret

277
00:15:58,612 --> 00:16:00,451
through your investigation.

278
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:01,411
Exactly.

279
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:02,811
That is to say,

280
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,051
if we can find the clue
to solving the treasure map first,

281
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,252
this situation might
take a turn for the better.

282
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:09,092
Exactly.

283
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:10,732
The destroyed evidence

284
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:12,291
might not condemn Prince Yi.

285
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,171
We discovered it in exchange.

286
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:15,132
It's worth it.

287
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:17,531
I've secretly reported it
to the minister

288
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:18,972
and asked for his assistance

289
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:20,771
to find clues
from this new breakthrough.

290
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:22,248
Additionally,

291
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:24,771
I've submitted the petition
to him to impeach Prince Yi

292
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:26,252
for abducting a girl

293
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:29,411
to treat him the way he treated us.

294
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,092
We must teach Prince Yi

295
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:32,411
a lesson.

296
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,012
Zishan, let's go back and rest.

297
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:37,736
Okay.

298
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:45,051
Have a look!

299
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,892
Purely handmade cloth tigers.

300
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,811
Have a look.

301
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,852
(Zuiyun Tower)
Try it out. You get what you pay for.

302
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:55,372
Take a look.

303
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:56,771
Have a look.

304
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,732
This is of pretty good quality.

305
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,492
Take a look.

306
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:05,892
The food's here.

307
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:08,691
Enjoy your meal.

308
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,332
Sir, are you still hiring tavern maids?

309
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:13,572
Coming to apply?

310
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:15,332
What can you do?

311
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:17,651
Good memory, arithmetic, observant.

312
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,572
I can do all that
a tavern maid should know.

313
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:25,572
Aren't you Miss Xue'er
of the Ganlu Brewery?

314
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:29,572
How can you

315
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:31,656
be a serving girl at our restaurant?

316
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:33,132
Isn't this a joke?

317
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,772
Moreover, you offended people.

318
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:36,092
How can I hire you?

319
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:38,812
Sir, please show me some mercy.

320
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:40,132
I really can do anything.

321
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:48,332
Miss Xue'er, the work
of a serving girl is not that easy.

322
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:50,892
Can you handle this job?

323
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:52,931
Come on.

324
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:56,332
Tavern maids are servile all day long.

325
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:58,612
You can't do this.

326
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,372
You're really drinking it?

327
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:06,931
I was just saying.

328
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:07,892
You can't drink like this.

329
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:17,612
Put it down.

330
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:18,971
Put it down.

331
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,411
Sir, I'm finished.

332
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:24,612
Can you hire me now?

333
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:26,852
Miss Xue'er, I'm truly sorry.

334
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:28,812
You should look elsewhere.

335
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:30,052
Don't make this hard.

336
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:32,092
Please give me a chance.

337
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:33,011
- Don't.
- Please.

338
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,491
- Don't make it hard.
- Give me a chance.

339
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:35,731
Your Highness, take care.

340
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:37,928
Mind your step.

341
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:40,572
(That is Prince Yi?)

342
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:42,171
Your Highness.

343
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:46,292
Your Highness.

344
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:46,892
Your Highness.

345
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:47,651
Your Highness.

346
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:53,896
Watch where you're going.

347
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,092
Your Highness,
please forgive me. I didn't mean it.

348
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:58,931
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

349
00:18:59,372 --> 00:18:59,812
Please...

350
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:05,171
Thank you, Your Highness!

351
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:09,171
Your Highness, take care.

352
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:11,491
Alright, disperse.

353
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:12,532
Disperse.

354
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:17,411
It's a great fortune for you
to receive His Highness's handkerchief.

355
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:21,372
Fine. Do some cleaning for now.

356
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:24,612
- Waiter, show her around.
- Thank you.

357
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:26,171
My lady.

358
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,892
I heard Prince Yi
was suddenly summoned back.

359
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:30,931
No one knows what the matter is.

360
00:19:31,852 --> 00:19:32,772
What do you think?

361
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,971
Could it be because of General Xu?

362
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:40,052
I've heard many people discussing it.

363
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:42,612
Prince Yi is being impeached

364
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:44,011
of forcing a civilian girl.

365
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:47,411
Rumors are
that General Xu did it for you.

366
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:48,104
Don't talk nonsense.

367
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:51,171
You should pretend
not to hear such things.

368
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:53,411
Otherwise, it'd bring
the general unnecessary trouble.

369
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,424
Yes, I understand.

370
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:58,251
Found Shuangshuang?

371
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:00,931
We've searched all the nearby villages.

372
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:02,772
We have no idea
where else she could have run to.

373
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:04,171
Keep searching.

374
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:05,812
I promised Ms. Zhou.

375
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:07,532
We must find her.

376
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:08,731
Yes.

377
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:15,211
Take it. Be careful.

378
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:16,532
I just bought this jade bracelet.

379
00:20:17,411 --> 00:20:18,856
Yes, Miss Lin.

380
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:22,572
You...

381
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:23,532
Miss Lin, I'm sorry.

382
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:24,731
You useless thing.

383
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:26,572
This is my most cherished jade bracelet.

384
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,328
Are you deliberately going against me?

385
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:30,892
No, I'm not.

386
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:33,211
It's not broken.

387
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:37,772
Money.

388
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:39,211
My lady.

389
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:42,612
Buy some medicine later,

390
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:44,211
so others won't see it

391
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:45,892
and think I abuse my servants.

392
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:49,772
Thank you, Miss Lin.

393
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:51,332
Useless thing.

394
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,200
Mother, wait for me.

395
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:10,491
I'll come to save you
when I save enough.

396
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,691
I forbid this marriage.

397
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:36,812
(Shen Danqing,)

398
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,691
(you can't afford to offend Prince Yi.)

399
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:41,052
(That was stupid.)

400
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:46,292
(Prince Yi,)

401
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:50,491
(are you the person who can
help me turn my fortunes around?)

402
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:52,532
(Zuiyun Tower)
Take care.

403
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:53,852
Come to my place to go on.

404
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:54,332
Okay.

405
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:57,411
Sir, here's your wine. Please enjoy.

406
00:21:59,092 --> 00:22:02,852
How about having fun
with me later in the room upstairs?

407
00:22:03,451 --> 00:22:04,931
There will be perks for you.

408
00:22:05,572 --> 00:22:07,691
Sir, this is a restaurant,
not a brothel.

409
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:10,612
You're just a tavern maid.

410
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,931
You should consider it
your good fortune that I fancy you.

411
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:15,491
- You've had too much to drink.
- Show me.

412
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:17,332
Let go of me.

413
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:21,052
Who did it?

414
00:22:21,852 --> 00:22:22,971
(Du Ying'er)
You should thank me.

415
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:25,092
If I had splashed boiling water,

416
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:27,211
we could have
pig head meat to eat right now.

417
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:29,332
You wretch!

418
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:30,092
What's happening here?

419
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:31,211
A grown man bullying a woman.

420
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:33,052
Isn't that shameful?

421
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,211
Drunk and looking for trouble

422
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,092
at this place?

423
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:35,892
Don't.

424
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,451
Sir, listen to me.

425
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:40,451
Look at her. She must be
rich or of high status.

426
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,572
She might have valuable connections.

427
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:46,251
Everyone, calm down.

428
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:48,292
To make a fuss over such a girl

429
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:50,251
is not worth it.

430
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:52,372
How about this?
Your meals are going to be free.

431
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,651
And I'll give you
a few more jars of fine wine.

432
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:55,451
Is that okay?

433
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,532
Sir, sorry. It's all my fault.

434
00:23:00,772 --> 00:23:01,691
Please show some mercy

435
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:03,612
and don't hold it against me.

436
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:04,211
Yes.

437
00:23:04,411 --> 00:23:05,532
Please cool down.

438
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:06,372
Bring the wine.

439
00:23:06,572 --> 00:23:07,491
Alright.

440
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:08,200
Waiter, hurry!

441
00:23:08,612 --> 00:23:09,931
Disperse. Nothing to see here.

442
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:11,052
Leave.

443
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:13,852
Thank you for helping me out there.

444
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:15,931
My name is Luo Xue'er. I'm 21.

445
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:18,211
May I ask your age?

446
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,011
I'm one year older than you.
My name is Du Ying'er.

447
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,812
You can just call me Ying'er.

448
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:24,931
Thank you, Ying'er,
for your timely help.

449
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:26,931
Without you...

450
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,892
I just can't stand seeing
a man bully a girl.

451
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:37,171
Your hands clearly
aren't meant for rough work.

452
00:23:37,812 --> 00:23:39,092
There must be some reason

453
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:41,411
why you've become a servant
in this restaurant.

454
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:48,532
This is Hetian jade.
It's worth a bit of money.

455
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:49,491
You take this.

456
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,491
I stood up for you today,

457
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:53,011
but I offended him.

458
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:54,532
I guess he'll seek revenge.

459
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:56,532
It would be best if you left this place

460
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:57,812
and go to somewhere else.

461
00:23:58,491 --> 00:23:59,528
Thank you, Miss Du.

462
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:00,680
Take care.

463
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:14,332
To be so generous upon a chance meeting.

464
00:24:16,572 --> 00:24:17,532
Du Ying'er.

465
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:19,491
Got it.

466
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:44,892
Wait.

467
00:25:01,892 --> 00:25:02,691
Just now,

468
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:05,411
did you...?

469
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:28,451
General!

470
00:25:30,971 --> 00:25:31,656
Why is it you?

471
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:32,691
It is me.

472
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:34,332
Who did you think it was?

473
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:40,852
It's morning?

474
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:41,892
Yes.

475
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:44,211
You must have been
a bit tired these days,

476
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:45,451
so you got up a bit late today.

477
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:49,491
Tianhao, why do you
always disturb my dreams?

478
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:52,572
What do you mean?

479
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:53,812
It's nothing.

480
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:55,852
Right, General,

481
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,292
I have washed Miss Shen's handkerchief.

482
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:00,332
You can return it to her
the next time you see her.

483
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:01,812
Handkerchief?

484
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:04,491
The one she used
to bandage the wound you got

485
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:06,052
when getting medicine for Mr. Shen.

486
00:26:06,852 --> 00:26:07,752
You were drunk at the time.

487
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,011
Your blood already soaked

488
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:10,171
through your outer garment,

489
00:26:10,572 --> 00:26:12,616
so I replaced the handkerchief
with a bandage.

490
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,512
Danqing's handkerchief.

491
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:20,132
If that's the case,

492
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:22,211
the dream I had that day...

493
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:24,572
It wasn't a dream.

494
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:27,772
It wasn't a dream.

495
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:29,812
It actually happened.

496
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:31,451
It happened.

497
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:33,292
General, are you all right?

498
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:34,052
Help me down.

499
00:26:36,852 --> 00:26:37,451
Tianhao,

500
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:39,411
take my invitation
to the Danqing Winery.

501
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,892
Please invite Miss Shen
to my mansion tonight.

502
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:42,931
Tonight?

503
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:43,720
Yes.

504
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:45,491
Do you know

505
00:26:45,491 --> 00:26:46,812
what the most commonly used method is

506
00:26:47,211 --> 00:26:48,491
when solving a case?

507
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:50,532
Scene reenactment.

508
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:53,171
I know, but what does that
have to do with it?

509
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:54,772
Don't ask so much. Go grind the ink.

510
00:27:01,092 --> 00:27:02,132
(You have done your best.)

511
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:04,171
(Luo Ailian is still alive.)

512
00:27:05,132 --> 00:27:06,011
(She's right here.)

513
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:07,892
(She's grateful to you.)

514
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:14,651
If that kiss was real,

515
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,171
then what she said was true.

516
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:20,731
Why did she say that?

517
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:29,772
Miss Shen.

518
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:32,491
Miss Shen.

519
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:33,451
Tianhao.

520
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:36,011
The general asked me
to buy Chengfeng Wine.

521
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:36,971
Besides,

522
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,292
he wishes to invite you
to his mansion tonight

523
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:41,491
to discuss something.

524
00:27:42,772 --> 00:27:43,651
Will my brother be going?

525
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:45,491
The general only invites you to go.

526
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:48,865
(Invitation)

527
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:53,971
Shuixian, take Tianhao to get the wine.

528
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:54,728
Yes.

529
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:56,612
General Tianhao, please.

530
00:27:57,512 --> 00:28:00,136
(Invitation)

531
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,332
What's destined to come

532
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,656
can't be avoided.

533
00:28:17,651 --> 00:28:19,011
What did you invite me over

534
00:28:19,772 --> 00:28:20,651
for?

535
00:28:23,691 --> 00:28:25,971
This Chengfeng Wine
you made is really good.

536
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,292
It's fragrant but not tangy
and intoxicating imperceptibly.

537
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:32,812
If you're looking
for someone to drink with,

538
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,372
you can have a hearty drink together

539
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,132
with my brother after he recovers.

540
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:39,251
I've got other matters at home
so I'll be leaving.

541
00:28:43,892 --> 00:28:44,892
Is there anything else?

542
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:51,892
The person I most want
to share a drink with right now

543
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,451
is the woman in my dream.

544
00:28:56,812 --> 00:28:58,171
A few days ago, in my drunken dream,

545
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,691
I encountered an outstanding beauty.

546
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:02,411
We bared our souls

547
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:03,772
and drank together.

548
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:06,332
It's just a pity

549
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:07,651
that she was gone

550
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:09,532
after I woke up.

551
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:12,211
So I could only resort
to such a foolish method,

552
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,251
hoping to see her once more.

553
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:20,052
You're drunk.

554
00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:22,971
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

555
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,011
What do you want to do?

556
00:29:30,532 --> 00:29:31,372
It is not a dream now.

557
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:35,411
Neither was that night we drank.

558
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:37,064
Am I right?

559
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:40,936
General,

560
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:42,971
you've had too much to drink.

561
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:44,451
It wasn't me
who drank with you that day.

562
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:48,772
I always value evidence.

563
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:51,691
If it hadn't been you that day,

564
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:55,332
why would this have been here?

565
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:01,691
You bandaged my wounds that day.

566
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:04,772
You told me

567
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,112
that alcohol helped.

568
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:09,372
You were always there to comfort

569
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:10,612
and accompany me.

570
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:13,691
I remember it all now.

571
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:16,691
That was not a dream.

572
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,072
Danqing,

573
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:23,772
why won't you just admit it?

574
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:29,411
I don't remember.

575
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:31,651
You don't remember?

576
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:35,292
How about this?

577
00:30:36,812 --> 00:30:37,772
I'll count down from five.

578
00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:40,651
If you still don't remember,

579
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:43,772
I will help you recreate the scene.

580
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:48,872
Five,

581
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:54,184
four,

582
00:30:58,651 --> 00:30:59,304
three...

583
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,251
You remember it wrong.

584
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:05,892
It wasn't me.

585
00:31:08,852 --> 00:31:09,612
Lying

586
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:11,772
will get you punished.

587
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:16,931
Two,

588
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:21,651
one.

589
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:26,092
I admit it.

590
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:27,892
It was me that day.

591
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:32,931
So you admit you kissed me.

592
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:37,092
Do not overthink it.

593
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:38,691
I was overcome by the alcohol.

594
00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:40,612
Please forget it.

595
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:42,536
Wait a minute.

596
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:45,691
I have one last question.

597
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,451
Why did you mention Luo Ailian that day?

598
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:51,720
Because...

599
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:54,772
Because I know her.

600
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,052
You know her?

601
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,491
I met Luo Ailian by chance.

602
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:04,092
I know she appreciated others' kindness.

603
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:08,052
If she knew you thought of her,

604
00:32:08,852 --> 00:32:10,171
she'd definitely say thank you.

605
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:12,451
I see.

606
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:14,731
I thought...

607
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:16,372
What?

608
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:18,612
You've got a physician, Mr. Miao.

609
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:20,572
I thought

610
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:22,691
you secretly saved her.

611
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:27,812
If possible,

612
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:31,048
I do wish before the tragedy occurred,

613
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,532
someone saved Luo Ailian.

I've come to apologize.

623
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:36,572
I was rude last night.

624
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:38,332
To express my apology,

625
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:39,892
can I invite you to watch flowers?

626
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,011
Beside Liao City, Mount Tianqing

627
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:43,612
is adorned
with beautiful blooming begonias.

628
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:45,011
So can I ask you...?

629
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:45,612
Sorry, General.

630
00:33:46,772 --> 00:33:47,612
Don't rush to refuse.

631
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:49,691
It won't take you too long.

632
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:53,160
I'll make up for any lost revenue.

633
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:55,332
That's not what I meant.

634
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,892
It's just that I already
have an appointment.

635
00:33:58,612 --> 00:33:59,651
An appointment? With whom?

636
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:00,712
Me.

637
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:03,532
Zishan?

638
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:06,731
Danqing and I will go
to the temple fair.

639
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,491
What temple fair?

640
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,931
We have a temple fair here every year

641
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:12,172
in honor of the Flower God.

642
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:14,411
It lasts from noon until night.

643
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,172
Zishan's never been there,

644
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:18,051
so I thought I'd take him to see it.

645
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:20,332
I was thinking about taking a stroll
since I'm better.

646
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:22,971
I'll leave you two to talk.

647
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,011
I'll go tidy up and close the shop.

648
00:34:27,852 --> 00:34:28,776
- Danqing.
- Chengfeng.

649
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:30,172
Thank you for the antidote.

650
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:32,011
I will always remember it.

651
00:34:32,252 --> 00:34:32,852
Let's go outside.

652
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:35,411
No, Zishan.

653
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:36,292
I've got plans today.

654
00:34:36,611 --> 00:34:38,292
(Danqing Winery)
I'll invite you to my place next time.

655
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:39,931
I'll leave you here.

656
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,411
- I won't see you out.
- Zishan.

657
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,852
We practiced martial arts together.

658
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:48,692
I always trust and respect you.

659
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:53,451
You should be very clear
about what's on my mind.

660
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:56,172
Right, I am very clear

661
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:57,652
about your thoughts.

662
00:34:58,332 --> 00:34:59,011
But let me tell you.

663
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,091
Impossible.

664
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:03,971
Zishan, you know me.

665
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:06,411
- I never go to a brothel.
- That's not the question.

666
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:09,212
No matter what else you do,

667
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:10,372
I support you.

668
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:11,732
But only Danqing.

669
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,131
I don't agree with you
being so close to her.

670
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:15,852
You don't agree?

671
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,812
Zishan, you are just Danqing's brother.

672
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:20,931
Yes.

673
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:23,332
But that can change.

674
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,091
You mean...

675
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:33,928
Alright.

676
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:36,212
It's up to Danqing's choice.

677
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:38,451
Fair competition.

678
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:39,976
Fair competition.

679
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:44,808
- Danqing.
- Danqing.

680
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:47,212
General, why are you still here?

681
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,372
Are you going with us?

682
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:49,051
Yes.

683
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:49,772
He said he'd return.

684
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:53,252
Danqing, I've never been
to the temple fair either.

685
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:54,451
Let me join you.

686
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:55,051
Another time then.

687
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,692
Let's do it another day.

688
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:59,332
It's rare that we siblings
can go out and relax.

689
00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:00,172
You can understand.

690
00:36:01,332 --> 00:36:02,408
- Zishan.
- Let's go.

691
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,172
Even holding hands.

692
00:36:38,091 --> 00:36:40,971
Flowers for sale.

693
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:43,931
Miss, buy a bouquet
to pray for a good marriage.

694
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:46,172
Buying flowers for a good marriage?

695
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:49,732
It's said that the Flower God
loves the hustle and bustle

696
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:51,772
and especially loves to choose maidens

697
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:54,571
carrying bouquets at this temple fair
to grant them a good marriage.

698
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:56,252
Sir,

699
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:58,792
the lady's hands are empty.

700
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:01,732
Why not take one each?

701
00:37:01,732 --> 00:37:02,971
Good things come in pairs.

702
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:05,131
Look at those people.

703
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:06,571
Aren't they also looking

704
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:09,091
for the one with the same flowers?

705
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:13,292
Danqing, pick a bouquet.

706
00:37:14,091 --> 00:37:14,971
Which one would you like?

707
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:17,011
I'll pick

708
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:18,491
the same flowers as you.

709
00:37:18,652 --> 00:37:20,011

710
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:22,248
Miss, you are truly fortunate.

711
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:24,692
Madam, you are joking. He is my brother.

712
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:31,531
Thank you.

713
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:36,520
Zishan, I want to eat Tanghulu.

714
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:39,051
Okay, wait here for me.
I'll go and buy it.

715
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:39,411
