00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,280
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:37,988
Miss Xue'er.

4
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:39,148
Miss Xue'er.

5
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:40,948
Did you find any money left?

6
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:43,467
There is no more money available
for payment on the account.

7
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,508
However, in the ledger,
I found a receipt

8
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,788
for the money Master deposited
in a money house.

9
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:49,148
Please take a look.

10
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,840
(Baofeng House)

11
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:02,988
That's right.

12
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:05,307
Mr. Luo deposited some items

13
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:07,907
in our store a long time ago.

14
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,748
Do you know what my father deposited?

15
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:12,667
If I remember correctly,

16
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,748
Mr. Luo said

17
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:17,068
it was a dowry for his three daughters.

18
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:18,707
A dowry?

19
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:21,387
Then please retrieve it quickly.

20
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,707
Miss Xue'er, please present the seal.

21
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:26,188
Once we confirm it,

22
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:27,667
I will get it ready immediately.

23
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:28,867
The seal?

24
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,387
The item is not like the others.

25
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:32,228
It is a treasured possession of Mr. Luo.

26
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:34,028
Therefore, it was stored separately

27
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,468
with a special seal made for it.

28
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,468
You must present the seal
to retrieve this item.

29
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:41,387
Yes, my father did give me a seal.

30
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:43,827
But I've been busy with Ganlu Brewery.

31
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:45,028
I came in a hurry without the seal.

32
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,308
Could you make an exception for me?

33
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:48,908
I can give you my signature.

34
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,068
I am sorry, Miss Xue'er.
But we need to follow the rules.

35
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:04,267
(Miss, I went to make some inquiries.)

36
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,667
The Luo family has no money left.

37
00:03:06,107 --> 00:03:08,107
But it seems that Mr. Luo
had deposited a dowry

38
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:09,748
at a money house
for his three daughters.

39
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:12,628
It's said to be Mr. Luo's
lifelong savings.

40
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:15,748
But Luo Xue'er failed to withdraw it

41
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:16,748
for not having the right seal.

42
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:20,348
The Luo family is now
in urgent need of money.

43
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:23,228
Luo Xue'er will certainly
find a way to get the seal.

44
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:25,707
After Mr. Luo passed away,

45
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,707
everything should be
in the hands of Ms. Zhou.

46
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:30,267
Shuixian.

47
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:30,867
Mmm?

48
00:03:31,508 --> 00:03:32,667
Keep an eye on Luo Xue'er.

49
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,308
If she visits the prison,

50
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:35,707
let me know immediately.

51
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:37,188
Mmm.

52
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:40,788
It wasn't easy to corner her.

53
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:43,348
I must not let her rise from the ashes.

54
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:44,547
Yes.

55
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:53,827
(You are a murderer,)

56
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,348
(Luo Xue'er.)

57
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:57,707
(You don't deserve to take
the dowry left by Father.)

58
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,667
(I must corner you)

59
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:02,948
(to take back Ganlu Brewery.)

60
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:06,387
(That's Father's lifelong effort.)

61
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,027
All of Ms. Zhou's personal belongings
when she was imprisoned were here.

62
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:18,308
Please have a look.

63
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:47,068
(The seal is not at home
nor with Mother.)

64
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:48,907
(Where else could it be?)

65
00:04:58,907 --> 00:04:59,707
Mother.

66
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:03,267
Mother.

67
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:09,467
Well, what a rare visitor!

68
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:10,668
What?

69
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:13,628
What troubles have befallen you

70
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,227
that have reminded you

71
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:17,188
of your mother in prison?

72
00:05:17,748 --> 00:05:19,227
You misunderstand me.

73
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,387
I've been struggling
to manage Luo's household

74
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:23,948
in order to welcome you back in glory.

75
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,827
Drop the act!

76
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,267
If you truly intended to save me,

77
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:28,587
you'd have tried to rescue me

78
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:30,188
when you got the money.

79
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:31,907
But when you got the money,

80
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:33,467
you thought you were safe

81
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,628
and wanted to let me die here.

82
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:38,387
You came here with false pretenses.

83
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:39,948
What exactly do you want?

84
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:44,188
Mother,

85
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:47,147
I came today just to tell you

86
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:49,467
that your precious daughter,
Shuangshuang,

87
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:50,787
is not doing too well.

88
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:53,387
In order to make her life a bit better,

89
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:56,068
I've decided to withdraw the dowry

90
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:58,948
that Father deposited in a money house
for his daughters.

91
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:00,748
Luo Xue'er,

92
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,267
I really underestimated your appetite.

93
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:05,707
So you want the dowry.

94
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:06,748
Listen to me.

95
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,548
Don't even think about
laying a finger on it.

96
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,787
Do you think
I came here today to beg you?

97
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:13,227
You are wrong.

98
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,308
I've come to see you for the last time.

99
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:17,948
You were smart all your life
but baffled at last.

100
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:19,587
You shouldn't have given

101
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:21,988
the withdrawal seal for the dowry

102
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,308
to Shuangshuang, your stupid daughter.

103
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:27,508
How did you know
that Shuangshuang has the seal?

104
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:30,267
Thank you, Mother.

105
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,227
I know it now.

106
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:33,748
You tricked me!

107
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:38,467
You unfilial daughter! You even schemed
against your own mother!

108
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:40,227
I simply treated you

109
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:42,948
the way you treated me.

110
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:43,587
You!

111
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:46,988
Mother, are you angry because you think
I haven't learned well enough?

112
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:49,508
I just don't get it.

113
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,347
Both Shuangshuang and I
are your daughters.

114
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:54,907
Why do you always favor her?

115
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:58,108
Shuangshuang is better than you.

116
00:06:58,508 --> 00:06:59,267
She's not like you.

117
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:01,147
You were born a bad seed.

118
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,188
I was born a bad seed?

119
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:04,748
Since you hate me so much,

120
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:06,267
why did you give birth to me

121
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:08,227
and pretend
that I am Luo Jida's daughter?

122
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:09,628
How...

123
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,227
How did you know?

124
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:14,827
The sinner has been you.

125
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:17,108
Why do I have to bear all the pain?

126
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,227
Save the act!

127
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:26,227
Do you think Father
will like you this way?

128
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:27,188
Come and get it.

129
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:28,027
Give it back to me.

130
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:30,868
Pick it up, then.

131
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,628
You... Luo Shuangshuang!

132
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:42,467
How dare you come here to find me?

133
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:48,628
There's something
I must ask you in person.

134
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:50,868
I've left the Xiao family.

135
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:53,508
What are you, a servant,
pestering me for?

136
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,188
(The Xiao family?)

137
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,308
(What's Mother's relationship
with the Xiao family?)

138
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:00,227
You were Master Xiao's concubine.

139
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:01,948
You knew that back then, Luo Jida

140
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,347
took advantage when Master was ill

141
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:04,668
and annexed Xiao's wine business.

142
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:06,868
Luo's business thrived
and grew to its current scale

143
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:08,267
(Kong Wu, former servant of the Xiaos)
by feeding on the blood of the Xiaos.

144
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:10,227
How can you sleep with your enemy?

145
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:11,508
Where is your conscience?

146
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:12,668
What do you know?

147
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:15,347
You are a mere servant.

148
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,227
What right do you have to accuse me?

149
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:18,988
Master had been very kind to me.

150
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:21,347
I could not let him die with regrets.

151
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:23,787
I didn't come today to argue with you.

152
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:24,748
I have a question.

153
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:26,668
When you left the Xiao family back then,

154
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:27,948
you were pregnant

155
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:29,508
with Master Xiao's child.

156
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:31,027
Where is that child?

157
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:33,908
Not long after I left,
I had a miscarriage

158
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:34,867
and lost that child.

159
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:37,028
It's been 16 years since you left.

160
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:38,707
And I heard

161
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:41,268
that the eldest daughter
you had with Luo Jida

162
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:43,308
is also 16 years old this year.

163
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:44,347
Shut up!

164
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:47,268
(16 years old?)

165
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,308
My daughter has been
living a good life with me here.

166
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:52,668
She has nothing to do
with the Xiao family.

167
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:54,467
Master loathed the Luo family.

168
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:56,668
You let his enemy father his daughter.

169
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,107
If Luo Jida finds out
she is Master's daughter,

170
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:00,948
he won't treat her well.

171
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,347
It's all because of you

172
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,627
that I've lived so humbly
in the Luo family.

173
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:17,347
All the things that belonged
to me were taken away.

174
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:19,507
Not only did you not help me,

175
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:21,107
but you always favored Shuangshuang.

176
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:22,908
It's all your fault

177
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:24,908
that you end up like this.

178
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,388
Xue'er, you are mistaken.

179
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,908
Things are not as you think, Xue'er.

180
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:33,467
Alright.

181
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:36,668
I've failed you as your mother.

182
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:38,507
I'm okay if you hate me.

183
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,068
I am already guilty of grave sins.

184
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:43,627
But Shuangshuang is innocent

185
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,788
and poses no threat at all.

186
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,587
You're sisters.

187
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:50,188
Having her by your side
is better than being alone.

188
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,068
Mother, don't worry.

189
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:00,627
Once I get the seal
and withdraw the dowry,

190
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:03,188
I will manage the Xiao family well.

191
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,107
When it's time for your execution,

192
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:07,388
I'll take Shuangshuang
to collect your body

193
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,827
and let her see your ending.

194
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:11,627
Only then will she understand

195
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:14,627
that in this life,
she can only live at my mercy.

196
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:17,388
If she doesn't know her place,
I'll lock her up for life

197
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,827
and have her do penance
in the suburban estate

198
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:20,867
to atone for your sins.

199
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:24,747
Xue'er! Xue'er!

200
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:25,948
Xue'er!

201
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:27,867
Xue'er!

202
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:33,928
(Prison)

203
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,707
Why are you here? What do you want?

204
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:49,148
Luo Xue'er came to see you, right?

205
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:51,827
She wanted the seal
for the dowry from you.

206
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,188
Let's not beat around the bush.

207
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,827
Luo Xue'er has left you here to die.

208
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,467
You definitely don't want her
to get that dowry.

209
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:03,987
How about you cooperate with me

210
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:05,627
and tell me where the seal is?

211
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:06,747
What a joke!

212
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:09,507
I owe my current situation to you.

213
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:11,028
Why should I cooperate with you?

214
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:12,587
It's because
I can save Luo Shuangshuang.

215
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:14,627
You don't know, do you?

216
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:18,308
Luo Xue'er has locked Luo Shuangshuang
up in the suburban estate.

217
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:20,227
If this continues,

218
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:21,467
she will go insane,

219
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:23,467
even if she survives.

220
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,068
However, if you cooperate with me,

221
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:28,028
I will treat Luo Shuangshuang kindly.

222
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:31,467
You've targeted the Luo family
time and again.

223
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:34,308
You and Luo Xue'er are the same.

224
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,308
Why should I believe you?

225
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:36,507
I am targeting the Luo family.

226
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:38,068
But I'm only after money.

227
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:39,627
I don't take lives.

228
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:41,268
But Luo Xue'er is different.

229
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:44,347
She has driven Luo Shuangshuang
to the suburban estate.

230
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,747
You know her methods better than I do.

231
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,148
Moreover,

232
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,188
apart from me,

233
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:51,707
do you have any other choice now?

234
00:11:54,268 --> 00:11:55,467
Are you really only after money?

235
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:58,107
Of course.
Just tell me where the seal is,

236
00:11:58,107 --> 00:11:59,707
and I'll go save Luo Shuangshuang
right away.

237
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:02,987
However, I have one condition.

238
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:05,388
If the Luo family falls into ruin

239
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:06,548
due to mismanagement,

240
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:07,707
I will

241
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:10,467
have the first right
to purchase Ganlu Brewery

242
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,148
as its top buyer.

243
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:21,148
It's okay.

244
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,107
I have plenty of time.

245
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:24,747
Take your time thinking about it.

246
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:27,028
However,

247
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:29,747
Luo Shuangshuang

248
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,908
might not have much time.

249
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:33,948
Can she afford to wait?

250
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,747
Fine, as long as you
ensure Shuangshuang's safety,

251
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:48,068
I agree to your terms.

252
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,268
Don't scream.
I'll let you go right away.

253
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:30,867
What...

254
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:32,948
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

255
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:34,747
Shush.

256
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,627
This place isn't safe.
Let's leave first.

257
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,107
I'll explain once we get out.

258
00:13:40,107 --> 00:13:42,548
Are you serious?
Your people are all over this place,

259
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:43,627
watching me all day long.

260
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:44,788
And you say it's not safe?

261
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:47,188
Shuangshuang, do you know
why I've hidden you here?

262
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:48,987
It's to protect you.

263
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,347
Otherwise, you would have
been captured long ago.

264
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:52,347
Captured?

265
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:54,068
Who would capture me?

266
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,908
Did you do something again?

267
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:57,188
Tell me!

268
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:01,827
Shuangshuang, you have a simple nature.

269
00:14:02,227 --> 00:14:03,668
There's something I haven't told you,

270
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:05,148
as I feared that it would worry you.

271
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:07,268
Father has deposited a substantial dowry

272
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:08,467
for us at a money house.

273
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:10,827
After Shen Danqing found out about this,

274
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:11,788
she wanted to kidnap you

275
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,948
to extort the dowry from Mother and me.

276
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:17,224
You have no proof.

277
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,148
Who knows if your words are true?

278
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:21,467
Boss, the back yard is clear.

279
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:24,587
Let's go quickly!

280
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:26,867
This is the place, right?

281
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:29,148
Miss Shen has ordered us

282
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:31,548
to catch Luo Shuangshuang tonight.

283
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,308
We must not let her escape.

284
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:34,308
Yes.

285
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:39,707
Quickly hide!

286
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:43,908
Get inside.

287
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:46,347
You should come in too!

288
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:47,188
There is not enough room.

289
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:00,627
Check inside.

290
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:01,188
Yes.

291
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:07,908
The bed is still warm.
She couldn't have gone far.

292
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,308
Split up and search.

293
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:10,268
Yes.

294
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:38,827
Come out quickly.

295
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:41,747
Shen Danqing did send people
to capture me.

296
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:44,908
The diversion won't last long.
Hurry up and go.

297
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,308
Over there!

298
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:50,308
Let's go!

299
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:50,747
After her!

300
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:17,747
Are you okay?

301
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:21,747
Xue'er, will they come back?

302
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:24,747
The most dangerous place
is often the safest.

303
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:26,707
Now that they left,

304
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,467
they probably won't come back.

305
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:30,388
Xue'er,

306
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:32,707
thank you for saving me just now.

307
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:35,827
I'm sorry for doubting you earlier.

308
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:39,747
I know your temperament.

309
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,587
You have a simple mind,
easily swayed by others.

310
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:44,867
It must be the rumors
of the servants here

311
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:46,467
that made you misunderstand me.

312
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:50,467
Alright. Let bygones be bygones.

313
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,268
Our top priority now

314
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:54,227
is to retrieve the dowry
our father left for us.

315
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:56,827
It must not fall into the hands
of that venomous Shen Danqing.

316
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:00,388
Do you have the seal
that Mother gave you

317
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:01,467
with you?

318
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,948
Once we withdraw the dowry
with the seal and exchange it for money,

319
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:06,467
we can save Mother.

320
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:07,388
The seal?

321
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,507
Mother never gave me any seals.

322
00:17:12,188 --> 00:17:13,348
Mother said she gave it to you.

323
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:14,148
Think again.

324
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:15,987
I really don't have it.

325
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,467
Shuangshuang, Mother is still in prison.

326
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:21,747
No one is here to protect us.

327
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:23,267
We've been sisters for years.

328
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:24,987
Even though we have had our differences,

329
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:26,588
I just saved your life.

330
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:28,188
And you still won't tell me the truth?

331
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:29,628
Mother really didn't give it to me.

332
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:30,948
I swear.

333
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:33,067
If I lie to you, may heaven
strike me with thunder.

334
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:36,148
(Luo Shuangshuang's thoughts
are all over her face.)

335
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,707
(She doesn't seem to be lying.)

336
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:40,507
(But where could the seal be?)

337
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,588
Alright, I believe you.

338
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,668
Don't ever take such oaths again.

339
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:50,707
Could it be that mother
put it inside something else?

340
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,227
Think again.

341
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,348
Something else?

342
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:57,668
Mother gave me a chest.

343
00:17:58,188 --> 00:17:59,828
She said it was jewelry for me.

344
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:01,388
She also said

345
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:03,267
that you mustn't know about it.

346
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,787
Perhaps the seal is in there.

347
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:08,908
Where is it?

348
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:12,467
It's under the camphor tree
in the courtyard.

349
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,588
It's just that I've been locked up
these past few days

350
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:16,108
and haven't had the chance to check.

351
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:18,707
Should we hurry and dig it out now

352
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:20,148
so that Shen Danqing

353
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:21,668
can no longer go after the money?

354
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:24,948
The chest won't go anywhere.

355
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:26,948
It's already late.

356
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,067
Let's rest tonight.

357
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:31,547
We'll take the seal and go home
tomorrow morning.

358
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:33,148
Okay.

359
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,547
Miss!

360
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:51,868
Well done.

361
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:55,348
That idiot Luo Shuangshuang
completely trusts me now.

362
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,227
I used to be Master Xiao's trusted aide.

363
00:18:58,108 --> 00:18:59,027
He was gracious to me.

364
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,507
Now I have been called upon by you.

365
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:01,628
I'll serve you wholeheartedly.

366
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,148
What else do you need?

367
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:05,948
It is right under this tree.

368
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:07,148
Hurry up and dig it out.

369
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:08,628
Mmm.

370
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:13,067
Please take a look.

371
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:27,027
She actually left
so much good stuff to that idiot.

372
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:33,868
This should be it.

373
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:38,588
Open it.

374
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,868
Okay.

375
00:19:55,588 --> 00:19:57,348
Now all this is mine.

376
00:19:58,388 --> 00:19:59,348
Congratulations, Miss.

377
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:03,908
By the way, that stupid Luo Shuangshuang
is in her sleep right now.

378
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:06,388
Have someone keep an eye on her.
Don't let her leave.

379
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:07,668
Rest assured, Miss.

380
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:15,067
It's almost dawn.
Escort me into the city.

381
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:15,747
Okay.

382
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:37,707
(She didn't bring
Luo Shuangshuang with her.)

383
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,628
(She probably already
got the jewelry box)

384
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:40,747
(from Shuangshuang.)

385
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:43,188
Shen Danqing, it's you again?

386
00:20:43,547 --> 00:20:44,987
Why are you always following me?

387
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:46,467
Running so fast?

388
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:48,987
You probably did something shameful.

389
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:49,868
Get off the carriage!

390
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,148
You come with me. Let the others stay

391
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:53,148
and deal with them.

392
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:54,547
Get them!

393
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:57,987
Take the seal. Don't kill anyone.

394
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:05,547
Kong Wu, go!

395
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:07,467
Miss!

396
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:08,227
Come out!

397
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:10,307
Don't move!

398
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:14,868
Put it down, or I'll kill her.

399
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:17,467
Shen Danqing, don't you dare hurt me!

400
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:18,307
You can try.

401
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:20,307
If you want to live,

402
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,707
hand over the seal.

403
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:26,148
No!

404
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,027
You're ruthless in dealing with me.

405
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,348
Do you want to go to jail again?

406
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,588
Cut the chatter
and hand it over quickly.

407
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:34,108
Kong Wu, give it to her!

408
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:55,067
Let's go.

409
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:55,987
- Yes.
- Yes.

410
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:57,267
Miss!

411
00:21:58,747 --> 00:21:59,507
Are you alright?

412
00:22:10,348 --> 00:22:11,027
What...

413
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:13,227
You're brilliantly astute.

414
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:15,507
How could you have such foresight?

415
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:16,868
Earlier, about the recipe,

416
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:18,707
Shen Danqing has caused me heavy losses.

417
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:21,027
Once she finds out

418
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,027
that I need the seal to get the money
to get through,

419
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:24,948
she will do everything to obstruct me.

420
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:27,948
I am no match for her in strength.

421
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:30,027
But if I pretended

422
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:31,948
to be willing to risk my life
for this chest,

423
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:34,027
she would believe

424
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,467
that the seal was inside.

425
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,148
I'm impressed, Miss.

426
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:41,032
(Shen Mansion)

427
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,787
Young Master.

428
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:45,388
You've returned.

429
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:46,588
Where is Danqing?

430
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:48,547
She went straight back to her room.

431
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,067
She said she wanted to be alone.

432
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:51,908
What happened?

433
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:53,188
I don't know.

434
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:55,948
After getting the seal,
we went straight to the money house.

435
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:58,747
But after she left the money house,

436
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:00,707
she looked upset and kept quiet.

437
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:02,467
I didn't dare to ask more.

438
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,828
Alright, you may leave now.

439
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:06,828
Okay.

440
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:10,628
Young Master,

441
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:12,348
General Xu is here.

442
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:13,707
He's waiting for you at the door.

443
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,987
Ask the general to go to the cottage.

444
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:20,787
I'll meet him there.

445
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:21,628
Yes.

446
00:23:28,868 --> 00:23:30,227
Chengfeng, are you here because

447
00:23:30,348 --> 00:23:31,868
you made new progress
in the investigation?

448
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:35,108
I went to the scene
of Know-it-all's death again.

449
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,987
I found more grease stains
on the floor of the tavern.

450
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:42,787
But strangely,
in the place where Know-it-all died,

451
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:44,908
the floor was exceptionally clean.

452
00:23:45,188 --> 00:23:46,267
And upon touch, it feels rough.

453
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,348
I remember you saying

454
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:49,707
that what Know-it-all was holding

455
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:51,388
was her unique hidden weapon.

456
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:53,388
And its surface also feels rough
to the touch

457
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,388
and is similar to that of the floor.

458
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:58,467
So, I wonder

459
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:00,747
if you know what could have caused this.

460
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:19,227
This is borax.

461
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:20,348
Also known as moonstone.

462
00:24:20,828 --> 00:24:22,148
It can be used for cleaning.

463
00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:23,467
Regardless of the stain,

464
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,467
it can be completely removed
by using borax

465
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:26,388
within minutes.

466
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,027
However, after using it,

467
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:30,027
the surface will feel rough to the touch

468
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:31,227
like this hidden weapon.

469
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:33,067
But why would the murderer

470
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,307
use borax to clean the floor

471
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,067
and Know-it-all's hidden weapon?

472
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:39,987
What were they trying to hide
by doing this?

473
00:24:43,388 --> 00:24:44,987
They might have been injured.

474
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:46,108
You mean...

475
00:24:46,507 --> 00:24:48,027
We always thought Know-it-all

476
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:49,507
hadn't had the chance to act

477
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:50,787
before she was killed.

478
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:52,828
But in fact, Know-it-all
injured the killer

479
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:53,828
with a hidden weapon.

480
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:55,467
And the murderer was poisoned.

481
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:56,707
But they didn't die on the spot.

482
00:24:57,188 --> 00:24:59,828
So the murderer
is also an expert in using poison.

483
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:02,467
They feared that we would
track them down

484
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,188
through the antidote.

485
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:06,467
So they used borax to clean the floor
and remove the bloodstains

486
00:25:06,747 --> 00:25:07,987
in an attempt to confuse us.

487
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:10,348
So as long as we find out who bought

488
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:12,348
special medicinal ingredients
at the pharmacy recently,

489
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:14,227
we can find out who the murderer is.

490
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:17,467
Exactly. Let's split up and take action.

491
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,948
I'll have Mr. Miao investigate
what the antidote for the poison is.

492
00:25:25,388 --> 00:25:26,388
By the way, Zishan.

493
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:30,188
Where is Miss Shen?

494
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:34,547
Danqing has been busy
with other matters lately.

495
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:36,547
Do you have something to tell her?

496
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:38,108
I can relay the message.

497
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:40,828
It's nothing.

498
00:25:41,588 --> 00:25:42,307
I just wanted

499
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:44,948
to ask her for a jar of Chengfeng Wine.

500
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:47,388
Another jar of Chengfeng Wine?

501
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:49,628
Then there's no need to trouble Danqing.

502
00:25:50,227 --> 00:25:51,348
I'll get it for you.

503
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,747
Alright, thank you.

504
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,948
Sir, please take it out.

505
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:10,707
My people are waiting outside.

506
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,027
It's already prepared.

507
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:13,868
Miss Xue'er, please wait a moment.

508
00:26:20,908 --> 00:26:21,628
Miss Xue'er,

509
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:23,507
here.

510
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:25,467
It's what my father left behind?

511
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:26,467
Yes.

512
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:34,507
A painting?

513
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:38,868
This must be a mistake, right?

514
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:42,227
The item Mr. Luo deposited
is exactly this painting.

(I gave you Chengfeng Wine in the past,)

00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,108
(hoping that you can retain
a heart full of passion)

551
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:39,067

552

(what storms you face.)

553
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,507
(Now you gave me the same wine)

554
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,108
(as you saw my sorrow)

555
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:46,828
(and wished to console me.)

(We always understand each other.)

Danqing.

558
00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:55,868
The Chengfeng Wine?

559
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:57,828
Has General Xu been here?

560
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:02,348
I know you went
to the money house today.

561
00:30:02,948 --> 00:30:04,227
What happened?

562
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:06,547
Is there something wrong with the seal?

563
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:08,267
Ms. Zhou didn't lie to me.

564
00:30:08,987 --> 00:30:10,227
The real seal was hidden

565
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:12,148
in the secret compartment
of the jewelry box.

566
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:13,668
It was very concealed.

567
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:15,787
There was also a fake seal
inside the jewelry box.

568
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:18,227
Have you retrieved everything?

569
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:20,067
I've retrieved everything I need.

570
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:22,868
But I have left one thing
at the money house

571
00:30:23,747 --> 00:30:24,707
for Luo Xue'er

572
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,067
to take a look at.

573
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:29,588
Impossible!

574
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:32,948
Did you embezzle my father's property

575
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:34,067
since you know he's dead?

576
00:30:34,348 --> 00:30:35,507
Hand over everything.

577
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:38,828
Miss Xue'er, I'll be honest with you.

578
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:40,987
Actually, you have the wrong seal.

579
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,668
Miss Shen already came
with the real seal.

580
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:47,987
But she didn't take all the items
after checking them.

581
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,307
She said

582
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:53,067
that these were the things Mr. Luo
left for his daughters.

583
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:53,987
And she also said

584
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:55,267
that if you claim them,

585
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,987
I should give you this painting,
even if you have the wrong seal.

586
00:30:58,507 --> 00:31:00,467
Now that you have the painting,

587
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:02,668
if there is nothing else,

588
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:04,828
you may leave with it.

589
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:08,787
I don't believe you.

590
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,067
How could it be?

591
00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:14,348
Miss Xue'er!

592
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,628
Bad news, Miss Xue'er!

593
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,227
Many people have gathered

594
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:18,787
at the residence to demand debts.

595
00:31:18,948 --> 00:31:19,868
Please hurry back.

596
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:22,067
Otherwise, the residence
will be emptied out.

597
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:23,067
What?

598
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,067
- Pay back the money!
- Pay back the money!

599
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:42,588
She's over there.

600
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:43,948
Stop her. Don't let her run away!

601
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:44,507
Pay the money!

602
00:31:44,507 --> 00:31:44,948
Stop!

603
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:45,868
- Pay it!
- Pay up now!

604
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:49,267
Repay the money!

605
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:50,507
Give me the money back!

606
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:51,747
When will you pay us?

607
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:52,747
Pay me back!

608
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:05,148
Everyone, please calm down.

609
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,507
I am Shen Danqing,
the owner of Danqing Winery.

610
00:32:12,188 --> 00:32:13,707
Regarding Luo Xue'er's
selling inferior wine,

611
00:32:13,987 --> 00:32:15,227
I have reported it to the authorities

612
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:19,348
and purchased Ganlu Brewery
and the Luo family's assets.

613
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:22,027
I will bear all debts.

614
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:23,868
The banknotes are at Ganlu Brewery now.

615
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,227
If you want your money back,
please go to Ganlu Brewery.

616
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:28,828
The Shen family managed
to buy the Ganlu Brewery?

617
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:30,507
Impossible!

618
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:32,348
Impossible, right?

619
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:35,067
I don't believe it. Where is the proof?

620
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:36,948
This is the contract

621
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:38,628
Ms. Zhou signed with me.

622
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,628
(Purchase Contract)
It clearly states

623
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:42,747
that if the Luo family goes bankrupt,
the Shen family

624
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:45,148
can have priority
in purchasing Ganlu Brewery.

625
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:47,227
If you still want your money back,

626
00:32:47,948 --> 00:32:49,348
hurry to Ganlu Brewery.

627
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:51,148
Let's go.

628
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:54,467
If we can't get the money,
we'll come back.

629
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:55,307
It's not over yet.

630
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:56,787
Let's go.

631
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:00,467
(The Luo family's business
was sold off? Impossible.)

632
00:33:03,668 --> 00:33:04,868
Did you see the painting

633
00:33:05,908 --> 00:33:06,547
left by Mr. Luo?

634
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:08,467
It was you!

635
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:12,547
You must have bribed
the shopkeeper of the money house

636
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,467
and stolen the wealth
my father left behind,

637
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,467
leaving me only a crappy painting.

638
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,348
Now you're even
usurping the Ganlu Brewery.

639
00:33:18,868 --> 00:33:20,148
You shouldn't speak nonsense

640
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,628
without proof.

641
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:24,348
And there is no 'usurping'.

642
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:25,868
I have the contract

643
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,948
I signed with Ms. Zhou as proof.

644
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:30,828
The contract?

645
00:33:32,868 --> 00:33:34,227
So, my mother told you everything?

646
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,188
That's right.

647
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:44,507
Your mother told me about the seal.

648
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:47,188
Just in case,

649
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:49,027
she kept the real seal

650
00:33:49,707 --> 00:33:52,067
in a secret compartment
of Luo Shuangshuang's jewelry box.

651
00:33:52,668 --> 00:33:53,948
And it was you

652
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:55,467
who gave me the jewelry box.

653
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:58,467
You didn't expect that, right?

654
00:33:59,027 --> 00:34:00,588
Your scheming backfired on you.

655
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:04,307
Mother, you would rather give the money

656
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:05,987
to the enemy than to me.

657
00:34:06,787 --> 00:34:08,268
You have been insatiably greedy,

658
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:10,228
doing all sorts of evil
for the family's wealth.

659
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,948
Guards! Take her away.

660
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:18,667
Shen Danqing,

661
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:20,828
who do you think you are?

662
00:34:21,908 --> 00:34:23,388
The matters of the Luo family

663
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:25,268
are not your place to interfere.

664
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,987
I am the daughter of the Luo family.

665
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:29,828
Let me go!

666
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:33,507
Shen Danqing!

667
00:34:34,568 --> 00:34:37,320
(Luo Family's Ancestral Hall)

668
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:42,708
Miss, she's here.

669
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,467
You may leave.

670
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:47,348
Yes.

671
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:54,868
What have you brought me here for?

672
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:59,368
(Luo Jida's Memorial Tablet)

673
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:00,828
What?

674
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:02,467
Are you scared?

675
00:35:05,388 --> 00:35:06,147
Kneel.

676
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:14,507
Shen Danqing, I bear you
no grudges or hatred.

677
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,708
Why are you doing this?

678
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:16,667
No grudges or hatred?

679
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:19,788
Do you also bear no grudges
or hatred against Luo Ailian?

680
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,467
You know Luo Ailian?

681
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:27,268
What do you know?

682
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:29,868
I know everything
you've done to Luo Ailian.

683
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,587
Tell me. Did you kill Luo Ailian

684
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:35,547
and Mr. Luo?

685
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:38,027
What nonsense are you talking about?

686
00:35:38,987 --> 00:35:40,268
She killed Father and self-immolated.

687
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:41,587
The authorities have concluded.

688
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:43,868
You have no right
to make excuses for the murderer.

689
00:35:46,308 --> 00:35:47,467
Say it again when looking at them.

690
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:51,547
What?

691
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:53,067
Scared?

692
00:35:53,788 --> 00:35:54,667
Speak!

693
00:35:56,147 --> 00:35:58,388
Luo Ailian would never
kill her own father

694
00:35:58,627 --> 00:35:59,788
or immolate herself.

695
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:02,107
You caused the tragedy of the Luo family

696
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:05,467
with your insatiable desires
and ruthless, cruel nature.

697
00:36:05,987 --> 00:36:07,348
In order to climb up,

698
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:10,147
you even killed your own kin!

699
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:13,948
My own kin?

700
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:16,627
I am not the daughter
of the Luo family at all.

701
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:19,187
I did all this just to take back
what belongs to me.

702
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,308
What did you say?

703
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:27,228
I might as well tell you.

704
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:31,948
My birth father was the founder
of Xiao Winery.

705
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:34,547
Luo Jida seized my father's property

706
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:36,467
and developed it into
the Ganlu Brewery of today.

707
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:39,187
After my father died,

708
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:41,828
my mother became Luo Jida's concubine.

709
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:44,868
As for Luo Ailian,

710
00:36:45,948 --> 00:36:47,948
she always pretended to be innocent.

711
00:36:49,187 --> 00:36:51,467
She was the high and mighty
legitimate daughter of the Luo family.

712
00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:53,708
- She never truly respected me.
- Shut up!

713
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:57,987
What?

714
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:00,868
Now that you've heard
they are bad people,

715
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,547
you can't bear to listen anymore?

716
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:03,948
Alright.

717
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,348
Then let me tell you one more thing.

718
00:37:07,547 --> 00:37:09,948
In the dowry that Mr. Luo
left for his three daughters,

719
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:11,467
besides the painting,

720
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:14,107
there are also three wine recipes.

721
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:16,788
The recipes for the Luo family's wine

722
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:18,147
are worth a fortune.

723
00:37:19,027 --> 00:37:20,467
He had already planned everything
for you.

724
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,507
And with this painting,

725
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:29,467
he simply wished that his daughters

726
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:32,788
could live in harmony,

727
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:35,067
helping each other.

728
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,828
If he were really as evil as you say,

729
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:43,348
why would he have gone to such lengths
to consider everything for you?

730
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:45,667
You're talking nonsense!

731
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,667
The Luo family has never wronged you.

732
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,268
But look at you.

733
00:37:54,627 --> 00:37:55,748
What have you done?

734
00:37:57,948 --> 00:37:59,147
You killed him!

735
00:37:59,147 --> 00:37:59,816
(Luo Jida's Memorial Tablet)

736
00:38:01,788 --> 00:38:03,268
What does an outsider know?

737
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,667
The Luo family is not at all
what you think.

738
00:38:06,348 --> 00:38:08,027
Luo Ailian and Du Ruoshan met in private

739
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:09,268
and caused a tragedy.

740
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:12,268
The Dus wanted a daughter
from the Luos for a ghost marriage.

741
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:14,828
Luo Jida couldn't bear
to sacrifice his own daughter.

742
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:16,948
So he came to me.

743
00:38:18,147 --> 00:38:20,228
He monopolized
my birth father's business.

744
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:22,908
Then he wanted to sacrifice me
for something Luo Ailian did.

745
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:24,147
Why?

746
00:38:27,948 --> 00:38:30,547
This slap is for Mr. Luo,

747
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:32,467
as you are unfilial and ungrateful!

748
00:38:34,587 --> 00:38:36,868
This slap is for Luo Ailian,

749
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:39,268
as you requited kindness with enmity!

750
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:43,788
And this slap

751
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,748
is for all those you've harmed

752
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:48,147
by your outrageous acts
and lack of remorse!

753
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:53,467
I've done nothing wrong!

754
00:38:54,828 --> 00:38:56,147
I've simply made those

755
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:58,547
who wronged me pay the price.

756
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:01,388
No one can have a better life than me.

757
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,107
If I am suffering,

758
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,147
then no one else can expect
to have it any better!

759
00:39:19,308 --> 00:39:20,708
You are beyond salvation.

760
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:23,348
And all I can do

761
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,788
is stand up for those you've hurt

762
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,187
