Zishan.

4
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:25,896
Luo Xue'er is now dead.

5
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:29,256
Everything must come to an end here.

6
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:36,096
I have decided to marry Xu Chengfeng.

7
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:42,296
Ever since you decided
to become Shen Danqing,

8
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:45,937
you've embarked
on the most difficult path of thorns.

9
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:48,857
Now, finally, the clouds have parted
and the moon is clear.

10
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:51,057
I am truly happy for you.

11
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:53,536
As for other matters,

12
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,296
as I said,

13
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:56,937
as long as it's your decision,

14
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:59,256
I will support you unconditionally.

15
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:02,256
To live again

16
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,337
is already a blessing from the heavens.

17
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:08,976
How do I deserve such care from you?

18
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:10,457
Danqing.

19
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:13,136
I am good to you because you deserve it.

20
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:15,017
You are, in this world,

21
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:19,177
the most wonderful, resilient,
and kind-hearted woman I have ever seen.

22
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:22,217
So I can understand

23
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:25,576
why someone as proud as Chengfeng
would fall so deeply in love with you.

24
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:28,177
But don't forget

25
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,777
that he's not the only one
who is good to you.

26
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:33,376
I'm still here.

27
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,696
I remember the last time
I brought you here,

28
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,297
you said

29
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:42,976
that my company gave you a family.

30
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:47,536
But in fact, it's the same for me.

31
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:51,897
I have long considered you my family.

32
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:54,856
I will prepare a dowry for you

33
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:58,416
so that you can marry
out of the Shen family with pride.

34
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,416
Just go ahead
and do what you want to do.

35
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,057
The Shen family is your backing,

36
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:06,816
your confidence,

37
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:08,096
and your support.

38
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,777
And I will always stand behind you.

39
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:13,696
Zishan.

40
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:15,777
Thank you.

41
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:40,897
Miss.

42
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:42,656
It's getting late. Let's go.

43
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:53,096
Ying'er.

44
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:00,656
Leaving without saying a word, huh?

45
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:03,136
Aren't we supposed to be best friends?

46
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:04,656
Dan...

47
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:09,017
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,096
I made a mistake.

49
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:16,376
I thought you wouldn't
want to see me again.

50
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:17,737
I know.

51
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,537
You and Danqing were close.

52
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:24,497
Danqing was lucky
to have a friend like you.

53
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:28,937
I wonder if I am fortunate enough
to have the same.

54
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:38,376
I hope that you will continue
to treat me as you do Danqing,

55
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,537
your best friend.

56
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:15,816
You've been writing all night long.

57
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:17,376
What else do we need to prepare?

58
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,657
Should we empty the General's Mansion
and give everything to the Shen family?

59
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:22,696
So what if we did?

60
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:24,376
Listen to me.

61
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:25,657
Be careful where you step.

62
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:27,057
Don't mess up these gift letters.

63
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,816
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

64
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:33,576
You're so good to Miss Shen.

65
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:35,816
Why are you calling her Miss Shen?

66
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:37,816
You should start calling her Madam.

67
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:38,857
Madam Xu.

68
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:45,497
By the way, has the letter I wrote
to the minister been delivered?

69
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:46,696
When can he come?

70
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:47,896
Rest assured, General.

71
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:49,617
The letter inviting the minister

72
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,097
to preside over the wedding
was sent early.

73
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:53,696
He will surely come for your engagement.

74
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:55,177
That's good.

75
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,456
My parents passed away early.

76
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,977
To me, the minister is like a father.

77
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:03,136
I hope that he can witness
this significant event in my life.

78
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:06,456
I also hope Danqing can feel
how committed I am.

79
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:07,816
Understood.

00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:19,856
Minister, do you have other
important matters for this visit?

187
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:23,096
Indeed, there is an urgent
matter I need to tell you about.

188
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,017
The treasure map is complicated.

189
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:29,137
The Plum Wine you found can't seem
to reveal the treasure map's image.

190
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:41,897
Minister.

191
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,576
This Plum Wine was found by Danqing.

192
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:47,897
If we talk about wine,
I am not her equal.

193
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:49,096
How about this?

194
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,257
Let's wait for Danqing
to discuss it further.

195
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:52,937
Okay.

196
00:11:58,137 --> 00:11:58,736
Minister.

197
00:11:58,736 --> 00:11:59,496
This is Danqing.

198
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:01,297
Danqing.

199
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:02,377
Greetings, Minister.

200
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:04,377
No need for formalities.

201
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:05,816
Danqing.

202
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,216
According to the minister,

203
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:09,057
somehow this Plum Wine

204
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:10,696
cannot reveal the treasure map's image.

205
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:12,137
How can this be?

206
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:14,897
Could someone have tampered
with it during transportation?

207
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,017
I've already asked about this.

208
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:18,537
The transport process

209
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,496
was solely managed
by the Imperial Guards.

210
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:21,576
It's absolutely foolproof.

211
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:24,736
I will leave the treasure map
and the developing water

212
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:26,137
right here.

213
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:28,696
Keep them at the General's Mansion.

214
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:30,537
The developing water has been opened

215
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:34,897
and will lose its revealing effect
in less than half a month.

216
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:38,696
The pressing matter is to confirm

217
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:41,177
whether the problem lies
with the treasure map

218
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,096
or with the developing water
as soon as possible.

219
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:51,696
Tianhao, escort the minister
to his room to rest.

220
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:55,616
- Minister, please.
- Okay.

221
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:10,417
Chengfeng.

222
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:13,696
You once said the minister's kindness
to you is as heavy as a mountain.

223
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:15,216
This is a matter of urgency.

224
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,976
Moreover, you have already
sent the marriage document.

225
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:19,816
We are practically family.

226
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,616
I should be more considerate toward you.

227
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:25,456
This matter concerns
the treasure map and Prince Yi.

228
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:26,456
We must be careful.

229
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,417
As for the wedding ceremony,

230
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:31,297
we can wait for half a month or so.

231
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:39,576
Danqing.

232
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:40,856
I assure you

233
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,177
that once all this is over,

234
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:48,576
- You'll have an unforgettable ceremony.
- Hmm.

235
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:06,816
Danqing.

236
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:08,777
Have you noticed anything unusual?

237
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:12,096
Although this wine has been
stored underground for years,

238
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,096
it is clear and transparent,

239
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:16,657
without any cloudiness

240
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:18,017
or suspended particles,

241
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:20,017
indicating it has been well-preserved.

242
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:22,216
If this Plum Wine is fine,

243
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,976
could we have made a mistake?

244
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:25,377
Is this not the developing water?

245
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:27,777
I've already asked Mr. Lin
to look for grass juice ink.

246
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:30,456
After testing, we will know
if it is the real developing water.

247
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,017
General.

248
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:34,937
General, Prince Yi has arrived.

249
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:36,976
Prince Yi?

250
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:50,537
Greetings, Your Highness.

251
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,657
It is rare for Prince Yi
to visit in person.

252
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:55,816
Apologies

253
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:57,377
for keeping you waiting.

254
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:01,736
I hear that you are
about to get married.

255
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:04,297
You're at the time
of deepest affection and sweetness.

256
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,216
I can wait a bit longer.

257
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:09,976
I am here to present

258
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:13,976
you two with this zither and se
under His Majesty's decree.

259
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:19,736
An oral decree from His Majesty.

260
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,816
For Minister Xu's recent marriage,

261
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:27,696
I cannot attend in person.

262
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:29,017
It's truly a regrettable matter.

263
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:30,137
I hereby offer

264
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,417
the pure-hearted zither and se as gifts,

265
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:35,137
wishing Minister Xu and Lady Shen
all the best as a worthy couple.

266
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:36,736
With the zither and se,

267
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,937
everything is peacefully fine.

268
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:40,616
At the time of the wedding,
let the zither and se harmonize,

269
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:41,897
as if I were present myself.

270
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,897
I will be greatly comforted.

271
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,816
You two should express your gratitude.

272
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:47,616
- Thank His Majesty.
- Thank His Majesty.

273
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:53,377
Thank you, Your Highness,

274
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,856
for personally delivering
the imperial gift of zither and se.

275
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,616
However, I am busy
with the wedding arrangements.

276
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:02,216
I won't detain you for long.

277
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,616
It seems the general
still harbors reservations against me.

278
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:12,657
Well, since my task
is already accomplished,

279
00:16:12,777 --> 00:16:13,937
I won't intrude.

280
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:16,496
Today, I only came to deliver a gift.

281
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:19,137
On the day of the ceremony,

282
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:22,336
I will be here
for the harmony of the zither and se.

283
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:27,096
At that time, I will bring you
an even greater surprise.

284
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:48,976
Are you worried that Prince Yi
might tamper with this instrument?

285
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:50,816
We must be careful.

286
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:02,576
The zither is clear and soaring.

287
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:04,417
The se is uplifting.

288
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:06,456
Listening to it,

289
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,016
they seem normal.

290
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:11,016
I will have someone
check them carefully.

291
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:12,216
Alright.

292
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:16,776
Although Prince Yi is quite arrogant,

293
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:20,377
he wouldn't tamper
with the imperial gift openly.

294
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:23,617
Besides, we have the minister
presiding over the wedding ceremony.

295
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,056
Displeased as he might be,

296
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,137
deliberately being sarcastic is all.

297
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:28,937
Tianhao.

298
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:30,976
Find the best musicians to practice

299
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,456
the zither and se duet pieces

300
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:34,177
before the wedding ceremony,

301
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:35,857
- so as to not fail His Majesty.
- Yes.

302
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:44,337
The reason why this Plum Wine can
reveal the routes on the treasure map

303
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:46,736
is that during the creation
of the treasure map,

304
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:50,817
a kind of invisible ink made from a
special herb was used to draw the route,

305
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,137
and the ingredients of the Plum Wine

306
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:55,577
happen to make
this invisible ink appear.

307
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,392
(Treasure Map)

308
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:30,937
Look, the characters
have become visible.

309
00:18:31,097 --> 00:18:33,817
This indicates that the Plum Wine
is indeed the developing water.

310
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:36,216
If there is no problem
with the developing water,

311
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,256
the issue must lie
with the treasure map.

312
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:41,337
Could it be that this
treasure map is fake?

313
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:43,817
Giving up Zong Wei's life

314
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:46,177
to make a narrow escape

315
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,817
and secure the true treasure map.

316
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:50,456
Killing two birds

317
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:51,696
with one stone, meticulous

318
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:53,937
and insidious. Sounds like Prince Yi.

319
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:56,736
In less than half a month,
the Plum Wine will be ineffective.

320
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:59,056
We need to find the real treasure map

321
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:01,137
before this effectiveness wears off.

322
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:02,897
If this map is fake,

323
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,536
the real treasure map should
be in Prince Yi's possession.

324
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:08,137
I must inform the minister
about this matter.

325
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:16,937
(Liao City Yamen)

326
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:19,417
(Today, I urgently request
all of you to come for a meeting)

327
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,857
to announce an important matter.

328
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:23,736
Your Highness.

329
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,417
This matter concerns
the national treasure of Dafeng.

330
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:28,337
Urgent matters require adaptation.

331
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:29,536
Please forgive me.

332
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:32,177
I received information

333
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:37,657
that the treasure map
obtained from Zong Wei was fake.

334
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:47,417
Your expression seems to indicate
that you knew about this.

335
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:49,577
That's right.

336
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:52,056
How did you know then?

337
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,496
Minister, please allow me
to explain gradually.

338
00:19:55,337 --> 00:19:57,897
The treasure map case is indeed complex.

339
00:19:58,496 --> 00:19:59,976
And as an assistant investigator,

340
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:02,857
I have already found the truth.

341
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:04,577
The map is indeed fake.

342
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:07,496
Because it was swapped many years ago.

343
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,536
And the person
who swapped the treasure map is

344
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:13,496
precisely the Luo family of Liao City.

345
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:21,536
Why suddenly bring up the Luo family?

346
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:23,577
Not sure what he's scheming.

347
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:24,776
Respond calmly.

348
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,056
The Luo family?

349
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,377
Is Prince Yi referring
to the local liquor merchants Luo?

350
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:31,696
The Luo family is but a mere merchant,

351
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:34,776
seemingly unrelated to the treasure
map as horses are to cows.

352
00:20:35,377 --> 00:20:37,817
I have irrefutable evidence.

353
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:43,337
Days ago, I sent someone
to sort through Zong Wei's belongings

354
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,097
and unexpectedly found
a journal he left behind.

355
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,536
It is recorded in it

356
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:51,056
that Zong Wei was injured
while pursuing the treasure map

357
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,617
and fainted near Luo's residence.

358
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:56,256
The person who saved him
was the Luo family's Master, Luo Jida.

359
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:59,016
Luo Jida took the treasure map

360
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:01,897
and returned it to Zong Wei
after he recovered.

361
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,976
Based on the notes and my deductions,

362
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:09,216
the treasure map was swapped
out by Luo Jida long ago.

363
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:11,536
And the real treasure map

364
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:15,256
should still be
in the hands of the Luo family.

365
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,776
Luo Jida is a wine merchant in Liao City

366
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,976
who has hardly ever left here.

367
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,016
And Zong Wei is your personal bodyguard

368
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:24,577
who came to Liao City with you
just a few months ago.

369
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:26,817
The two are totally unrelated

370
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:28,696
and have nothing to do
with the treasure map.

371
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:33,296
Why do you always like to bring up
those who are unrelated to the case?

372
00:21:33,296 --> 00:21:34,617
Besides, both of them are already dead.

373
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:35,897
This is your side of the story.

374
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:36,617
There's no evidence.

375
00:21:39,496 --> 00:21:40,216
Your Highness.

376
00:21:40,696 --> 00:21:44,377
You have confused me.

377
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:47,857
One moment you say
the treasure map is in Zong Wei's hands,

378
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:51,657
and the next you say it's in Luo Jida's.

379
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:54,097
So where exactly
is the real treasure map?

380
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:55,657
As everyone knows,

381
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,817
Luo Jida was killed
by his eldest daughter, Luo Ailian.

382
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:00,696
It caused a huge commotion at the time.

383
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:01,617
Everyone knew about it.

384
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:03,097
Most people thought

385
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,177
it was because the eldest daughter
was given a ghost marriage

386
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,696
that she turned against her father.

387
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:11,256
But upon my investigation, I discovered

388
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:13,377
that the audacious Luo Ailian

389
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:16,056
was really after the treasure map.

390
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:17,216
That's why she killed her father.

391
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:20,736
If that's true, Your Highness,

392
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:24,016
and Luo Ailian did kill her father
for the treasure map,

393
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:27,177
but she perished in a sea of flames,

394
00:22:27,536 --> 00:22:28,976
and the map remains untraceable.

395
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:32,137
Is this another of your claims,
Your Highness, without proof?

396
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:40,617
Who said that Luo Ailian is dead?

397
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:43,337
Not only is she still in this world,

398
00:22:44,216 --> 00:22:46,216
but she is also right here in this hall.

399
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:54,056
Your Highness.

400
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,496
What's that supposed to mean?

401
00:22:56,496 --> 00:22:59,817
She, Shen Danqing, is Luo Ailian.

402
00:23:07,817 --> 00:23:08,337
Your Highness.

403
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:10,696
That's ridiculous.

404
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:12,256
Your Highness.

405
00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:18,097
If the so-called evidence
you present is as bizarre as this,

406
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:21,417
I think we need not
continue any further.

407
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:24,496
Minister, please wait a moment.

408
00:23:24,897 --> 00:23:27,296
My witness will arrive shortly.

409
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:56,536
I'm Luo Xue'er. Greetings, Minister.

410
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:57,256
Your Highness.

411
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:00,536
Ailian.

412
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:02,536
Why are you so surprised to see me?

413
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:05,696
Did you think I was truly dead?

414
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:12,577
How dare you?

415
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:15,177
Do you take me for a fool?

416
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:17,617
I know you and Shen Danqing are enemies.

417
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:19,577
You want to use me
as your knife to kill.

418
00:24:19,937 --> 00:24:20,536
Come on.

419
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:23,137
- Drag her out and sink her in the lake.
- Yes.

420
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:24,897
Your Highness, I'm telling the truth.

421
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:27,256
If you don't believe it,
you'll miss this opportunity in vain.

422
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:28,817
You would be the stupidest person.

423
00:24:28,937 --> 00:24:29,536
Wait!

424
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:41,976
Dare you repeat what you just said?

425
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:46,696
After all, I am to be sunk in the lake.

426
00:24:46,696 --> 00:24:47,696
What's the harm?

427
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:50,897
The current Shen Danqing is Luo Ailian,
the murderer of her father in disguise.

428
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,776
She changed her identity
and has been deceiving people,

429
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,256
colluding with Xu Chengfeng.

430
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:56,417
My death is not a pity.

431
00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:58,817
But if Your Highness misses
this opportunity to deal with him,

432
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:00,177
you will regret it eternally.

433
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:14,177
Still unrepentant
even when facing death.

434
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:18,857
I believe what you say is true.

435
00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:20,657
Thank you, Your Highness.

436
00:25:21,496 --> 00:25:23,976
I have a plan to lend
Your Highness a helping hand.

437
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,097
Let me be the knife in your hand.

438
00:25:41,536 --> 00:25:43,696
The sinking in the lake was but a play

439
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,456
to deliberately let
someone see my corpse

440
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,417
and convince you that I was truly dead.

441
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:50,256
I didn't expect you to be so foolish

442
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:51,016
to take the bait.

443
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:53,536
Minister.

444
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:54,736
I can prove

445
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:57,417
that she is my sister, Luo Ailian.

446
00:25:58,617 --> 00:26:01,417
You say Shen Danqing is Luo Ailian,

447
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:02,736
but how can you prove it?

448
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:06,216
In Shen Mansion, there is a doctor
skilled in facial restoration.

449
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:07,937
After Luo Ailian killed my father,

450
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:09,617
she stole the real treasure map.

451
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,857
To evade the search,

452
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:14,417
she colluded with Shen Zishan to change
her appearance and became Shen Danqing.

453
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:30,137
Marvelous!

454
00:26:30,377 --> 00:26:31,696
Truly marvelous.

455
00:26:31,976 --> 00:26:33,617
I've listened to so many
storytelling sessions,

456
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:37,857
but none have been as exciting
and strange as your story.

457
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:39,937
Whether my story is true,

458
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,137
Minister, you can investigate.

459
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:42,177
Besides,

460
00:26:42,696 --> 00:26:44,857
Luo Ailian was once
burned in a big fire,

461
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:46,216
so she fears fire the most.

462
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:50,016
The always-brave Shen Danqing

463
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:51,776
was actually scared
to the point of turning pale

464
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,377
when watching the torch performance.

465
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:55,417
That is because
after she killed her father,

466
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:56,657
she set fire to her home.

467
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,937
She harbors deep guilt for her sins

468
00:26:57,937 --> 00:26:59,256
so she feels disheartened.

469
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:05,857
You say I am afraid of fire?

470
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,177
A test will tell.

471
00:27:08,097 --> 00:27:10,097
Minister, can you lend me a torch?

472
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:11,897
Okay.

473
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:50,216
(Danqing actually uses pain
to maintain her composure.)

474
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,177
How audacious!

475
00:27:58,337 --> 00:27:59,337
Miss Xue'er.

476
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:00,617
Didn't you say I was afraid of fire?

477
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,937
Repeat what you just said.

478
00:28:04,137 --> 00:28:05,776
You have a black lotus
tattoo on your neck

479
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,696
to cover the burn scars.

480
00:28:07,857 --> 00:28:09,016
Do you dare show it to everyone?

481
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:10,177
Are you mad?

482
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:10,696
Stop.

483
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:12,776
How audacious.

484
00:28:12,937 --> 00:28:15,696
How can you behave
so inappropriately in this hall?

485
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:16,736
What a disgrace.

486
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:17,817
Minister.

487
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:19,657
Finding the treasure map
is now of utmost importance.

488
00:28:19,736 --> 00:28:21,496
We must not let go of anyone suspicious.

489
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:25,016
Shen Danqing.

490
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:27,177
Now we must examine your body.

491
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:29,216
If there are no burns
or the lotus tattoo

492
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:30,897
on your body,

493
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:32,577
you can prove your innocence.

494
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:34,817
In order to prove my innocence,

495
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:36,377
must my reputation be ruined?

496
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:38,137
To ensure your reputation,

497
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,857
the female officer and Luo Xue'er
will examine you together.

498
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:56,536
Miss Shen.

499
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:57,617
No offense.

500
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:40,657
Minister,

501
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:42,696
Miss Shen has no burns on her neck,

502
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:45,337
- nor any sign of a tattoo.
- You...

503
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:53,817
Mr. Miao.

504
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:55,377
I would like to ask you for a favor.

505
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,696
Please be sure to agree to it.

506
00:29:58,097 --> 00:29:59,137
Please speak, Miss Ailian.

507
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:03,817
I suspect that Luo Xue'er
already knows that I am Luo Ailian.

508
00:30:04,817 --> 00:30:07,577
My identity will become a weak point
for Zishan and the General.

509
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:10,137
There must be
no slip-ups in this matter.

510
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,377
And I can't bring any danger
to the Shen family.

511
00:30:14,736 --> 00:30:18,097
So I want to ask you to help me
remove my tattoo and burn scars

512
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:20,016
and help me recover.

513
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:21,937
Okay.

514
00:30:23,776 --> 00:30:24,536
Thank you, Mr. Miao.

515
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:26,937
Luo Xue'er.

516
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:29,456
Do you have anything else to say?

517
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:30,696
Minister.

518
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,736
Shen Danqing is deceitful.

519
00:30:31,736 --> 00:30:34,056
She had already removed
the tattoos and burn scars in advance,

520
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:35,016
but she put on an act.

521
00:30:35,256 --> 00:30:36,377
What are you talking about?

522
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:37,857
I don't have any tattoos at all.

523
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:39,056
Nor have I ever been burned.

524
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:40,256
I dodged

525
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,736
because you were going
to tear off my clothes right here.

526
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:45,417
How can I, a pure and virtuous maiden,
endure such humiliation?

527
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:46,776
Luo Xue'er.

528
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:49,337
You've been rambling
and pestering up to now

529
00:30:49,617 --> 00:30:51,577
just because you held
a grudge against me

530
00:30:51,577 --> 00:30:53,137
and wanted to vent your anger.

531
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:58,177
Today, I've called everyone
here on short notice.

532
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,776
Shen Danqing couldn't possibly
have known that you would come,

533
00:31:02,256 --> 00:31:03,937
nor could he have made
preparations in advance.

534
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,417
If you continue to create
a ruckus and pester here,

535
00:31:07,137 --> 00:31:09,097
I will charge you
with the crime of slander.

536
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:10,296
Minister.

537
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:12,377
Shen Danqing has already
proven her innocence.

538
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:13,417
In the court,

539
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:16,496
how can we allow Luo Xue'er
to act up time and again?

540
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:17,937
You are in cahoots.

541
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:19,456
Of course, you'd defend her.

542
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,776
You are not allowed
to make a fuss in this court.

543
00:31:26,137 --> 00:31:27,056
Your Highness.

544
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:28,377
Luo Xue'er has no evidence

545
00:31:28,456 --> 00:31:30,377
or real proof, so...

546
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:34,417
Minister, please be patient.

547
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:36,377
I have other physical evidence

548
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:38,296
which should be arriving soon.

549
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:41,056
(The prince has a backup plan?)

550
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:51,456
Make way, make way.

551
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:55,937
Your Highness.

552
00:31:59,624 --> 00:32:01,352
(Tribute Wine Transportation Order)

553
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:11,456
Judging by Miss Shen's expression,
you should recognize this document.

554
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:13,776
What document?

555
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:16,976
The Luo family is a wine merchant

556
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,617
who was responsible
for the imperial palace's tribute wine.

557
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:24,496
This document is the transport order
handled by Luo Ailian.

558
00:32:24,937 --> 00:32:26,976
It bears her personal handprint.

559
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:30,897
Faces can be forged,

560
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,577
but the fingers' whorls
are hard to replicate.

561
00:32:34,657 --> 00:32:35,337
How wise.

562
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:38,016
The Transportation Order
has been kept in the palace.

563
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:40,256
It is absolutely impossible
to be switched or torn up.

564
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:41,696
I ordered someone to fetch it

565
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:42,657
and prepared the handprint.

566
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:44,016
I just wanted everyone to see

567
00:32:44,137 --> 00:32:46,296
if you really are Luo Ailian.

568
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,256
This indeed is a method.

569
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:51,657
Miss Shen.

570
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,016
Do you want to do the honors

571
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:57,256
or do you need my help?

572
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:04,337
All right.

573
00:33:04,976 --> 00:33:06,137
The evidence is irrefutable.

574
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,657
Minister, let's make it quick.

575
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,337
I admit it.

576
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:18,617
I am Luo Ailian.

577
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:23,456
Minister, Shen Danqing has admitted it.

578
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:25,736
Then everything I just said is true.

579
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:27,377
Minister.

580
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:29,177
Let's deal with it quickly.

581
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:30,617
Precisely because I am Luo Ailian,

582
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:33,097
I know that the treasure map
that Prince Yi mentioned

583
00:33:33,296 --> 00:33:34,296
is a frame.

584
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:36,617
My father didn't know anyone
named Zong Wei or anything

585
00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:37,897
about a treasure map.

586
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:39,216
So how could he steal it?

587
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:43,097
Minister, I asked Danqing not
to tell anyone about her face.

588
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:45,177
Back then, Luo Ailian
was trapped in a fire,

589
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,937
framed by someone,

590
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:46,776
and escaped from death.

591
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:49,016
And my sister Danqing
happened to be critically ill.

592
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:50,496
I selfishly took advantage

593
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:53,296
of her unclear consciousness
and changed her face.

594
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:54,097
It's my fault.

595
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,337
Minister, even if Shen Danqing
is Luo Ailian,

596
00:33:57,857 --> 00:34:00,817
it still can't prove that what Prince Yi
and Luo Xue'er said was true,

597
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:03,016
even less to prove
that she took the treasure map.

598
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:04,937
If you don't trust her character,

599
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:05,857
I can vouch for her.

600
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:08,576
Luo Ailian is definitely not a murderer.

601
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:10,576
Xu Chengfeng.

602
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:14,697
Luo Ailian is the wife whom
you're betrothed to.

603
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:17,016
Both emotionally and rationally,
you would speak for her.

604
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:19,937
Your guarantee is not credible.

605
00:34:23,176 --> 00:34:24,176
As for what my sister said

606
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:26,056
about Father never
knowing the treasure map

607
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:27,337
or Zong Wei,

608
00:34:27,337 --> 00:34:28,337
it's simply a lie.

609
00:34:29,257 --> 00:34:29,857
Ailian.

610
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:33,337
It was Father who had us go
find the doctor to treat Zong Wei.

611
00:34:33,857 --> 00:34:34,897
Why won't you just admit it?

612
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:38,857
Alright, let's discuss
the Luo family case later.

613
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:40,456
The pressing matter at hand

614
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:43,136
is to find out who stole
the treasure map.

615
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:45,217
Minister, you're right.

616
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:47,616
The real key is the treasure map.

617
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:51,417
Since it has been proven
that Shen Danqing is Luo Ailian,

618
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:53,176
then I can assert

619
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:57,297
that the treasure map is either
at Shen Mansion or the General's.

620
00:34:59,217 --> 00:35:01,496
Minister, I, Xu Chengfeng,
guarantee with my life,

621
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:02,697
that it's impossible.

622
00:35:04,656 --> 00:35:05,656
Impossible?

623
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:07,217
Who is telling the truth

624
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:08,377
and who is lying?

625
00:35:09,096 --> 00:35:11,857
You can just send someone to check.

626
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:14,217
Alright, what if it isn't found?

627
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:15,937
I will apologize immediately

628
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,576
and will not pursue the matter further.

629
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:18,737
Guards.

630
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:19,897
Pass on my order.

631
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:25,544
Search for the treasure map at Shen's
and the General's Mansion now.

632
00:35:25,544 --> 00:35:26,600
Understood.

633
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,409
(Silence)

634
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:41,352
(Evade)

635
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:45,377
Minister, after a thorough search of
both Shen's and the general's mansion,

636
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:47,096
inside a side hall
of the General's Mansion,

637
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,056
inside a box for storing sheet music,

638
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,976
this half of the treasure map was found.

639
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:52,337
Take a look.

640
00:35:57,817 --> 00:35:59,417
Get the developing water now.

641
00:35:59,417 --> 00:35:59,937
Yes.

642
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:08,337
Strange.

643
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:12,417
Why was Prince Yi so certain
that he could find the treasure map?

644
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:14,016
Let's see how things unfold.

645
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:22,777
(I am here to present)

646
00:36:23,937 --> 00:36:26,777
you two with this zither and se
under His Majesty's decree.

647
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:29,536
You may play the music right here.

648
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:32,656
This is the sheet music
for the wedding day.

649
00:37:10,777 --> 00:37:11,976
This is the real treasure map.

650
00:37:12,257 --> 00:37:13,016
It is real.

651
00:37:14,337 --> 00:37:16,096
But why is there
only half of the treasure map?

652
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:18,016
Xu Chengfeng.

653
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:19,817
What is your explanation?

654
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:24,937
Minister.

655
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:28,777
That half of the treasure map
was used to frame me.

656
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:30,056
How so?

657
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:35,817
The prince knew that the zither and se
would be played at the wedding ceremony.

658
00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:37,897
So he took the opportunity

659
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,737
to bribe the musicians invited
by the General's Mansion in advance.

660
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,576
Then, during the performance,

661
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:45,456
he brought that half of the map
to the General's Mansion

662
00:37:45,937 --> 00:37:47,257
and hid it within the sheet music.

663
00:37:47,257 --> 00:37:48,136
General Xu.

664
00:37:49,297 --> 00:37:50,697
At this point,

665
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:54,176
I advise you to stop framing me.

666
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:56,536
Aren't you the one doing the framing?

667
00:37:57,257 --> 00:37:58,976
Didn't you bribe the musician?

668
00:38:02,257 --> 00:38:04,496
You keep saying
that I colluded with the musician.

669
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:06,976
You can very well
bring him here to confront.

670
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:10,056
Since the prince dares to say so,

671
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,016
it seems that the musician
won't be coming.

672
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:16,136
Xu Chengfeng.

673
00:38:16,656 --> 00:38:20,217
I have Zong Wei's
handwritten note as proof

674
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:23,337
showing that the treasure map
did fall into the Luo family's hands.

675
00:38:23,496 --> 00:38:26,417
Now we also have a witness, Luo Xue'er,
the daughter of the Luo family,

676
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:28,496
proving that what's written
in the note is true.

677
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:31,456
Luo Ailian seized the map
and killed her father,

678
00:38:31,616 --> 00:38:34,417
before setting a fire to feign her death
and changing her identity.

679
00:38:35,377 --> 00:38:39,576
And your fiancée
has just admitted in the hall

680
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:41,096
that she is Luo Ailian.

681
00:38:41,616 --> 00:38:44,536
Now, the treasure map
has been found in the General's Mansion.

682
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,056
We have the witness, evidence,
and the stolen items all present.

683
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:48,496
Do you still dare to deny it?

684
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:53,176
Do you really have only empty rhetoric?

685
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:57,257
Fine, if it really was our doing,

686
00:38:57,257 --> 00:38:58,857
why did you only find half of the map?

687
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:02,217
Half?

688
00:39:03,337 --> 00:39:06,096
General Xu could have simply
divided and hidden the treasure map.

689
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:08,897
Isn't this just an example of not
putting all your eggs in one basket?

690
00:39:08,897 --> 00:39:10,096
Just a small trick, after all.

691
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,096
The prince's evidence
is indeed flawless.

692
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:15,377
But don't forget

693
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:17,777
I was the one
who found the developing water.

694
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:19,536
I also have the treasure map.

695
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:21,616
Why didn't I just go look
for the treasure?

696
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:24,656
Instead, I went through
great trouble to look for this map?

697
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,897
The most skillful chess players often
use traps to confuse the line of sight.

698
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:41,857
I admire you for this.

699
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:43,297
Alright.

700
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:44,897
The evidence is conclusive.

701
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:46,016
Minister.

702
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,857
Please deal with it as soon as possible.

703
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:51,056
Xu Chengfeng.

704
00:39:51,337 --> 00:39:52,697
You have greatly disappointed me.

705
00:39:53,656 --> 00:39:56,377
You three are implicated
in the theft of the treasure map.

706
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:57,576
Guards.

707
00:39:58,257 --> 00:39:59,297
Take them to prison

708
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:01,056
and interrogate them.

709
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:01,937
Hold on.

710
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:12,897
At this point,

711
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:16,976
it seems that I can only
come clean about everything now.

712
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:24,297
I stole the treasure map,
and the Shen siblings are not involved.

713
00:40:25,337 --> 00:40:27,337
I'm the only one

714
00:40:27,817 --> 00:40:28,976
who knows where the other half is.

715
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:30,377
- Chengfeng.
- Chengfeng.

716
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:32,576
No need for further words.
I'll take the responsibility.

717
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:36,937
I hope the minister
can spare the Shen siblings.

718
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:39,897
Before the developing water expires,

719
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:42,536
the other half of the map
will be handed to you.

720
00:40:44,456 --> 00:40:46,016
Should this developing water expire,

721
00:40:46,976 --> 00:40:49,456
even obtaining the complete
treasure map would be of no use.

722
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:51,297
Having put in so much effort,

723
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,616
would it not all be in vain in the end?

724
00:40:54,297 --> 00:40:56,297
Your Highness, don't you agree?

725
00:40:58,297 --> 00:40:59,016
What did you say?

726
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:00,976
It seems that you are not yet aware.

727
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:03,777
I said that once
the developing water is unsealed,

728
00:41:04,176 --> 00:41:05,536
it only lasts about half a month.

729
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,217
Now, there aren't many days left.

730
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,857
This is what I am most anxious about.

731
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:13,297
The matter of urgency

732
00:41:13,777 --> 00:41:15,976
is to quickly find
the other half of the map.

733
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:18,456
Minister.

734
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:23,217
This is why Xu Chengfeng
dares to be so confident.

735
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:24,536
In my opinion,

736
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:28,136
all three of them should be thrown
into the dungeon and interrogated.

737
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:30,576
I do not believe
that we can't get the location.

738
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,337
The matter is of great importance.

739
00:41:32,697 --> 00:41:35,937
Should there be
any mishap during this period,

740
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:38,857
neither you nor I could
explain it to His Majesty.

741
00:41:40,176 --> 00:41:42,417
It is still best to act cautiously.

742
00:41:43,016 --> 00:41:44,257
Put the three in prison

743
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:45,777
to await their fate.

744
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:48,016
Yes. Guards.

745
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:51,697
General, please.

746
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:03,456
I'm here. It's okay.
