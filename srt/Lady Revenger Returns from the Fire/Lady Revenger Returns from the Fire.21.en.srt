00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:18,880
=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,080
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:25,441
You wanted me to keep an eye
on Prince Yi.

4
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,760
I've recently learned
that Prince Yi's confidant has died.

5
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,560
It seems to be related to Xu Chengfeng,
Shen Danqing, and a few others.

6
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,280
Really? What happened exactly?

7
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:37,961
I'm not clear about the details.

8
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:40,521
I only know that Prince Yi
was devastated by this incident.

9
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:43,241
This might be a good opportunity for us.

10
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,280
Have you decided what to do next?

11
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:47,161
We must plan carefully.

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,081
By the way, have you
found Luo Shuangshuang?

13
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:51,961
No yet.

14
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:52,920
Not yet?

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,801
- Try to find her as soon as possible.
- Okay.

16
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:12,880
- Is it her?
- Let's go.

17
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,560
- Where is she?
- Didn't you just see her? Where is she?

18
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:33,160
I did see a woman similar to the one
in the portrait you gave me.

19
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,521
But she was gone.

20
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,041
Then keep searching.

21
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:38,680
Inform me if you find anything.

22
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:39,600
- Okay.
- Go!

23
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:42,241
- You two, go over there.
- Let's go.

24
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:45,680
No!

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,560
Don't kill me!

26
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:47,761
No!

27
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:48,521
Don't kill me!

28
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,641
Why would I kill you?

29
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:59,961
You've destroyed my family.

30
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:01,761
And now you've kidnapped me.

31
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,921
Isn't it to completely get rid of me?

32
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:05,440
Let's make it clear.

33
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,400
It was your family who framed me first.

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,481
But this time, I've come to save you.

35
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,720
I heard you were targeted
by a group of beggars today.

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,201
Had I not sent someone to rescue you,

37
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,160
you'd probably be in great danger.

38
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:26,081
Think about it.

39
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,560
Ever since Xue'er took charge,
you've been confined

40
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,600
at the suburban estate.

41
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:34,120
You can't even see your own mother.

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Up to this point,

43
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,400
are you still kept in the dark by her?

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,321
Haven't you been used by her enough?

45
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:44,440
Even so, why do you want to save me?

46
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,720
It's because I promised Ms. Zhou.

47
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:52,801
What?

48
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,081
My mother asked you?

49
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:01,241
But why would she do that?

50
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:03,081
What on earth is going on?

51
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,041
(- Xue'er, it's me.)
- Ying'er?

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,921
I've found something important.

53
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,040
Xue'er, you guessed right.

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
Shen Danqing's tasting wine action

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,040
is exactly like what you told me before.

56
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,681
It's like this.

57
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:28,321
Then there's no mistake. That's
Luo Ailian's unique wine-tasting habit.

58
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:33,441
Then we can confirm
that she is actually Luo Ailian.

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,001
A single action is not enough
for a complete confirmation.

60
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,480
What should we do?

61
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:43,681
Ask Shen Danqing
to meet you at the theater tomorrow.

62
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,040
The theater?

63
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:46,121
Yes.

64
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:48,881
(Zuiyun Tower)

65
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:49,400
(Ying'er,)

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,641
why go to the expense of inviting us
to see the variety show today?

67
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:54,800
You were busy recently.

68
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,160
And I've heard the variety show here
is particularly good.

69
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:00,040
- That's why I invited you here today.
- Okay.

70
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,280
Dear guests,

71
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,521
the variety show you requested
will start soon.

72
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,881
Please enjoy.

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,201
The performance has begun.

74
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,561
Danqing, are you alright?

75
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,201
No.

76
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,961
Bin, hold my hand.

77
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,160
Bin!

78
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,360
Bin!

79
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,360
Bin!

80
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:51,641
- No!
- Danqing?

81
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,761
- Bin!
- What's wrong?

82
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,360
Stop! Are you okay? Let's go home.

83
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:58,641
Danqing?

84
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,681
- Step down!
- Yes.

85
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
(She actually just called out 'Bin'.)

86
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,001
(It really is you, Luo Ailian.)

87
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,920
(I never thought
I'd see you again in this life.)

88
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,681
(I will now return
the suffering you caused me to you.)

89
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,240
General, bad news!

90
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:39,641
- Miss Shen is sick!
- What?

91
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:41,201
Shuixian told me during my delivery.

92
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,521
She seems to be very sick.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,561
She was frightened, fainted,

94
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,280
and got sick.

95
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,400
- No.
- What happened?

96
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,480
How could she suddenly become ill?

97
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,681
It's nothing. She was startled
when we saw the fire-breathing show

98
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,001
in the theater.

99
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,681
maybe she remembered her past experience
of being burned by fire.

100
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,201
A fire-breathing show?

101
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,001
Since you're here,

102
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,160
take good care of her.

103
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,521
Why not go to the authorities?

104
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,160
She's a murderer!

105
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:42,360
Things are clear now.

106
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,441
The Shen family's physician
is very talented.

107
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,800
Maybe she coaxed Zishan
with her sweet words

108
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,480
and had Mr. Miao change her face

109
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,160
while Danqing was gone
to impersonate her.

110
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,160
Perhaps Danqing was also killed by her.

111
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,480
Ying'er, calm down for now.

112
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,561
I don't care.
I'm reporting to the authorities.

113
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,761
I'm telling Mr. Du.

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,160
Don't do that!

115
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,160
Why?

116
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:08,240
You said my guess could be wrong
when I wanted

117
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:09,441
to go to the authorities.

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,961
But now we have confirmed it.

119
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:12,720
Why do you still disagree?

120
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:16,441
Xue'er, don't you dare
to report to the authorities?

121
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,321
Ying'er, just think about it.

122
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,561
Luo Ailian killed Ruoshan and my father

123
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,480
simply because they went

124
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:24,761
against her wishes.

125
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,600
Now we know a huge secret.

126
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,600
If we can't finish her in one blow,

127
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,201
we would instead alert her,

128
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:32,801
putting ourselves in danger.

129
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,120
So we'll just let her do more harm?

130
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:38,161
We have no solid evidence.

131
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,720
We must plan carefully.

132
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:42,760
Besides, General Xu
is protecting her now.

133
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:44,801
Even if we accuse her,

134
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,081
we may lose the case.

135
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:48,000
I guess you're right.

136
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,201
Then what should we do next?

137
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:54,281
Ying'er, you should go back

138
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,360
and keep pretending with Shen Danqing.

139
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:59,401
And I will continue
to look for evidence.

140
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,600
Also, you must keep this matter

141
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,441
from even your closest maid.

142
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,161
The fewer people know about it,
the safer it is.

143
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:14,880
(Ailian,)

144
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,561
(you can't beat me.)

145
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:19,401
(I will make sure you suffer)

146
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,281
(as you did last time.)

147
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,600
(Shen Mansion)

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,240
Miss,

149
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,801
you were quite indisposed
from the extreme fright.

150
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,681
And now you've caught a chill.

151
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,681
Mr. Miao has urged you to rest well.

152
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,681
Perhaps you shouldn't
visit the winery today.

153
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,281
I'm keeping an eye on the winery.

154
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:42,921
I'm fine.

155
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,561
Then I'll make you some sugar pear water
to take with you.

156
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,480
Where is Ying'er?

157
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,640
She was also there that day.
Was she frightened?

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,600
Rest assured.

159
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,760
Miss Ying'er is fine.

160
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,840
Miss, we've found
the old servant of the Xiaos.

161
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,041
He's waiting for you.

162
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,321
What that old man said
is detailed and substantiated.

163
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:21,760
It matches the Xiaos'
account book found by Mr. Luo

164
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,281
and the pawn tickets.

165
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:26,561
He is certainly the old servant
of the Xiao family.

166
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:29,561
Mr. Qin,

167
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:33,081
please send someone
to prepare some daily necessities

168
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:34,041
and take care of him.

169
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,480
Yes, Miss Shen.

170
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,561
It's enough to prove

171
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:40,441
that Master Xiao squandered
the Xiao family's fortune by himself.

172
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,760
Your family are innocent.

173
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:44,441
It's more than that.

174
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,961
My father was actually the benefactor
of Ms. Zhou and her daughter.

175
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,321
Luo Xue'er is indefensible this time.

176
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:55,360
I will make her admit to authorities

177
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:59,120
that she is an ungrateful criminal

178
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:01,760
to clear Luo Ailian's name.

179
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:03,921
And then...

180
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,801
Shouldn't you recover
from your illness first?

181
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Or how will you have the strength
to take revenge on her?

182
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,321
Alright, I'll listen to you.

183
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,600
(Justice will be done.)

184
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:23,681
(The day is finally approaching
when everything will become clear.)

185
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,201
Why did you suddenly ask to meet me?

186
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:30,640
Last time, you said
Shen Danqing was seriously ill.

187
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:31,961
How is she now?

188
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,120
She's not recovered.

189
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:35,520
Xue'er,

190
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,000
I really can't keep acting.

191
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,000
When can we strike with certainty?

192
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:40,720
You said you're looking for evidence.

193
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,441
Any progress?

194
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,201
That's exactly why I called you here.

195
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,000
I wanted to find Shuangshuang to testify

196
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,240
to confirm Ailian's identity.

197
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,480
But I haven't found her.

198
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,681
Then won't this just drag on and on?

199
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:57,000
I can't stay in Liao City forever.

200
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
We must bring the murderer

201
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,401
to justice before I leave.

202
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,321
My thoughts are the same as yours.

203
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:05,681
I've been thinking for days.

204
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,840
In fact, there's a way
to force her to confess.

205
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,961
But the method is somewhat risky.

206
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,360
What method?

207
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,201
Tell me about it.

208
00:12:17,281 --> 00:12:18,360
What is this?

209
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,961
This powder will put the one
who takes it in severe abdominal pain.

210
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,401
It can cause a lot of pain

211
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:25,961
but is not lethal.

212
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,161
Put it into the medicine
she is currently taking

213
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,401
so they won't know.

214
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,640
Are you saying this thing is harmful

215
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,640
but not lethal?

216
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:40,321
Won't there be any problems
by putting it

217
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:41,961
in her current medicine?

218
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,161
Rest assured. There will be no problems.

219
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,120
We're just using it
to force her to confess.

220
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,281
You and I both know she is Luo Ailian.

221
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:51,760
But we have no solid evidence.

222
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,161
If you can make her take this powder,

223
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:56,961
she'll suffer great pain

224
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,441
and will certainly confess.

225
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,561
Ying'er, don't worry.

226
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:04,840
No one else will know.

227
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,360
Besides, someone needs
to avenge Ruoshan.

228
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:11,840
Don't hesitate.

229
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:13,640
It's a good opportunity.

230
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:26,801
Being ill and not resting properly.

231
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,681
Here. Drink the medicine first.

232
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:30,281
Why are you bringing the medicine?

233
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,176
Where's Shuixian?

234
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,120
I sent Shuixian and Tieli
to buy some things for me.

235
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,801
You should get better soon.

236
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,681
So I will personally ensure
that you take your medicine today.

237
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,240
It's too hot.

238
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,120
Let it cool.

239
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,041
I'll take it later.

240
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,480
If the it cools down,
its efficacy will diminish.

241
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,880
Better to drink it while it's hot.

242
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:00,321
Okay, I'll do as you say.

243
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,600
This medicine must be very bitter.

244
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,720
Ying'er, could you find
some candied fruit for me?

245
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,520
- Okay, I'll go get them right now.
- Okay.

246
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:31,000
The medicine is too bitter.

247
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:32,360
Quick. Let me have some.

248
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:39,528
It's so sweet.

249
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,000
Miss Ying'er sent me to tell you
that the matter has been taken care of.

250
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,360
That's great.

251
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,921
Why didn't Ying'er come herself?

252
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,520
Miss Shen's condition worsened.

253
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,401
Miss Ying'er is currently indisposed.

254
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,961
So she sent me to tell you.

255
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,441
Later, after she soothes Miss Shen,

256
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:06,720
she'll take care of the winery affairs
on behalf of Miss Shen.

257
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,921
You can meet there tonight.

258
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,720
How is Miss Shen's condition?

259
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:15,961
She wakes on and off,

260
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,201
with short breath.

261
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:19,441
It's much more serious than expected.

262
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,360
I guess she is dying.

263
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,441
The whole Shen Mansion is now in chaos.

264
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,321
Even Miss Ying'er herself
is quite frightened.

265
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:34,041
I see. Then is it safe for Ying'er
to slip away at such a time to meet me

266
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,281
at the winery?

267
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:36,921
Miss Ying'er said

268
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,760
that the winery is empty now,

269
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:41,441
discussing the next steps with you there
is the best choice.

270
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,480
And it's also the least conspicuous way

271
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,720
she can think of now.

272
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,360
I see. You may go back now.

273
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:08,646
(Danqing Winery)

274
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,441
Ying'er? Ying'er?

275
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,401
Ying'er, I'm here.

276
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:30,801
Xue'er,

277
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,480
you're here.

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,720
A-Aren't you...

279
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,441
What? Are you disappointed

280
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:44,441
to see me well?

281
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,801
Did Du Ying'er tell you?

282
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,520
No. That's impossible.

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,760
Du Ying'er?

284
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:52,000
Were you hoping
she would poison me to death?

285
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:54,600
I had long realized
you were deliberately

286
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,441
getting close to her
to use her to harm me.

287
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:57,961
I kept quiet

288
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:59,801
just to see what you were up to

289
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,321
and let you expose yourself.

290
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,240
As expected, you're impetuous.

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,161
As for Du Ying'er,

292
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:08,641
I have already locked her up.

293
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:13,921
Otherwise, how could I come
to see you, my dear sister?

294
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,841
What's the matter? Why the sigh?

295
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,641
I sigh because even if
you want to avenge Du Ruoshan,

296
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,121
you should know the whole story

297
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,720
instead of listen to one side
of the story from Luo Xue'er.

298
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,961
H-How did you know?

299
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,520
Since you know,

300
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:44,641
stop pretending.

301
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:46,961
Luo Ailian,

302
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:48,641
you killed my Ruoshan

303
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:50,361
and then your own father.

304
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,921
Even if you escape this time,

305
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:55,000
you will be punished by karma.

306
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:56,841
Ruoshan's death
has nothing to do with me.

307
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:58,361
It was his own fault.

308
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:00,520
And the death of my father

309
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,881
is because of Luo Xue'er.

310
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,121
Nonsense!

311
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:06,361
If it weren't for your slyness
in avoiding the medicinal,

312
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,681
right now you would be kneeling
before me, begging for mercy

313
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,961
and confessing your guilt.

314
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,320
I poured the medicine

315
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,641
into the flowerpot.

316
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,320
Take a good look.

317
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:20,080
It was clearly a bowl of poison.

318
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,240
Luo Xue'er said

319
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:23,760
she wanted to use it

320
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,401
to restrain me only to let you kill me.

321
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,320
Can't you see that?

322
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,174
(Danqing Winery)

323
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,961
I shouldn't have trusted that loser.

324
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,000
She simply can't

325
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:51,841
do anything well.

326
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:54,361
You used Du Ruoshan's death
to deceive Du Ying'er.

327
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:55,560
You're really vicious.

328
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,480
What does her stupidity
have to do with me?

329
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,201
She doesn't know
what kind of a maniac Du Ruoshan was.

330
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:03,841
He barged into a maiden's room
at midnight for harassment

331
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,800
but had a palpitation
and died on the spot.

332
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:07,560
You know the truth.

333
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:09,520
Yet you distorted it
when telling Du Ying'er.

334
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,881
You wanted to let her kill me
so you could stay out of it.

335
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:13,760
Have you ever thought

336
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,201
what kind of punishment

337
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,240
she would face if you have her harm me?

338
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:19,040
You're ridiculous.

339
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:20,921
Why should I care about her fate?

340
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:24,760
To me, she is just a pawn
to be manipulated.

341
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:32,240
Well said.

342
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,000
How is it enough
that only I heard these words?

343
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,681
Ying'er, come out now.

344
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Luo Xue'er, I have treated you
with sincerity.

345
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,201
How could you use me like this?

346
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,320
It's your own fault for being foolish.

347
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,040
Now, knowing that the one
you loved deeply was such a person,

348
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,320
how does it feel?

349
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,841
We'll settle this score later.

350
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,161
You've brought that to yourself.
You can't blame anyone else.

351
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,280
What? Aren't you surprised to meet

352
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:29,000
your sister, Luo Ailian, again?

353
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:31,000
I didn't expect

354
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:32,361
that as your sister,

355
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,560
I would meet you with the appearance
and identity of someone else.

356
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:37,681
All of this is thanks to you.

357
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,560
Heaven is blind!

358
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:41,760
Luo Ailian,

359
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:43,401
you should have died long ago.

360
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:44,681
Right.

361
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,040
I was trapped in the fire
and my life was hanging by a thread.

362
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,520
Just when I thought
I was going to escape,

363
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,720
you ruthlessly attacked me.

364
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,800
I had considered countless people
who might have wanted to kill me,

365
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,560
but I never thought it would be you,

366
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,720
my dear sister.

367
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
I have searched my heart and know
that I've always been kind to you.

368
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,240
But how did you repay me?

369
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:17,121
What you did
left an indelible mark on me.

370
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,240
You and Luo Jida were both deceitful.

371
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,480
He usurped my birth father's property.

372
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,040
And you pretended to be nice
while always suppressing me.

373
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:26,601
You even wanted me to take your place
in a ghost marriage.

374
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,560
What a way to be 'kind' to me!

375
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,272
After all this,
you are still slandering my father.

376
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,641
Alright, as sisters,

377
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:38,601
we have many accounts to settle
in this and the previous life.

378
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,401
Let's settle them one by one.

379
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:44,121
I'll be the first to 'settle'.

380
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:46,401
Your family wronged me at first!

381
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:47,201
Is that so?

382
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:51,401
On that day when you lost,
you said righteously

383
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:54,000
that Master Xiao of the Xiao Winery
was your birth father

384
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,320
and that it was my father
who seized his family property

385
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,921
- to create the Ganlu Brewery today.
- That's right.

386
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,681
As soon as you told me, I began to doubt

387
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:06,320
how my father,
being so upright and respected,

388
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,240
could commit such a despicable act?

389
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,361
After my investigation,

390
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:13,280
my doubt was proved right.

391
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:15,641
It was all your speculation.

392
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,641
My father never did that.

393
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:22,040
Instead, he gave help.

394
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,441
Master Xiao had long been addicted
to gambling

395
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,240
and was deep in debt.

396
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:28,240
He even had to mortgage the winery.

397
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:31,681
It was my father who bought the winery
at a high price.

398
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,480
Otherwise, the entire Xiao family
would not have survived.

399
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,080
What a mouth you have,
twisting right and wrong!

400
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:40,641
To clear your and your father's names,

401
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,921
you've fabricated all sorts of nonsense.

402
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:49,560
This is the Xiao family's ledger.

403
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,760
Take a good look.

404
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,080
Impossible. How dare you forge this
and deceive me?

405
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,040
This is the testimony
of their former servant.

406
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:08,601
He's at the Shen Mansion.

407
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,841
If you don't believe me,

408
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:11,121
I can take you to see him right now.

409
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,240
The truth will reveal itself then.

410
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:26,441
I shouldn't have taken so much trouble.

411
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:28,000
But I pity you.

412
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,720
You have been blinded
by groundless hatred,

413
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,800
unwilling to face the facts.

414
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,441
So, I'm telling you the truth

415
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,320
to make you admit defeat willingly.

416
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:36,720
Impossible.

417
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,480
You're lying!

418
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:39,601
I'm lying?

419
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:40,921
You killed my father.

420
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:41,881
You killed Luo Ailian.

421
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:47,280
I'll have someone accompany you
to turn yourself in tomorrow.

422
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:49,520
You'd think it over carefully.

423
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,800
This is the last bit of luck

424
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:55,080
that I, your sister, left for you.

425
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,560
And don't think about using my identity
to threaten me.

426
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,121
You have no evidence.

427
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:09,760
Luck?

428
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,560
I also gave you luck once before.

429
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:16,040
That night, I arranged
for a carriage to take you away.

430
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:18,201
Why did you have to come back?

431
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:20,441
Why?

432
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,881
That's right.

433
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,441
Luo Ailian!

434
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,841
You shouldn't have come back.

435
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:37,000
You shouldn't.

436
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,961
Lock her in the shed.

437
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:48,401
- Take her to the yamen tomorrow.
- Yes.

438
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:13,320
I know you have deeply misunderstood me

439
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:17,161
and no matter how much I explain,
you might not believe me.

440
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,201
I set up this scene today
to let you know the truth.

441
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:25,601
Now you know everything.

442
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:29,800
I believe you've made up your mind.

443
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:35,800
What exactly have I done?

444
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,800
I'm sorry,

445
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:45,681
Danqing.

446
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:05,560
No!

447
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,040
Miss, it's me.

448
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:08,921
I'll save you.

449
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,480
Miss, bad news!

450
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:14,080
- Someone took Luo Xue'er away.
- What?

451
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:16,201
It's my fault. I only sent

452
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:17,520
two armed escorts to guard her.

453
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,560
I didn't expect there to be a master
by her side.

454
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,921
Gather the armed escorts

455
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:24,201
- and search her possible hideouts.
- Yes.

456
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,841
Miss, have some water to calm down.

457
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:37,560
Thank you for saving me.

458
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:41,480
Otherwise, I would have fallen
into the hands of Shen Danqing.

459
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:44,441
I saw you didn't return since
you went to Danqing Winery.

460
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,401
So I went there.

461
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,361
Miss, what should we do next?

462
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:54,441
Shen Danqing won't let me go.

463
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:56,800
I must find Prince Yi soon.

464
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,921
Prince Yi?

465
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:02,800
That's right. Now I know the secret
of Shen Danqing's identity.

466
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,560
Given the grudges
between Prince Yi's and Xu Chengfeng,

467
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,921
I can take the chance to offer

468
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:09,240
to serve Prince Yi.

469
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,921
By then, not only will my life
be out of danger,

470
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,881
perhaps I could even turn the tables.

471
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,921
It's a great plan.

472
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,040
But how do you plan
to get in touch with Prince Yi?

473
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,080
Don't worry.

474
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,520
Since I've escaped,

475
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:27,401
I believe that heaven won't abandon me.

476
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,520
(Luo Ailian,)

477
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,560
(let's wait and see.)

478
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,760
(If I could make you die once,)

479
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,841
(I can make you die again.)

480
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:42,058
(Prince Yi's Mansion)

481
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,401
Zong Wei,

482
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:09,080
how are you doing on the other side?

483
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,161
Did you receive the carriages,

484
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:12,800
horses,

485
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,240
and servants

486
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,320
I burned for you?

487
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,000
Xu Chengfeng.

488
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,841
Shen Danqing.

489
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,320
Shen Zishan.

490
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,841
You've not only ruined my plans

491
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,121
and my great cause,

492
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,480
but also killed my trusted follower.

493
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,601
I will definitely not spare you.

494
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,201
I will tear you into pieces

495
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:56,800
and make you suffer!

496
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:00,961
- Your Highness.
- What!

497
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,841
There's a woman outside the door
asking for an audience

498
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,201
She's presented this token.

499
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,201
She also claims
she can relieve your worries.

500
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:08,201
Are you blind?

501
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,641
Can't you see that I'm in a bad mood?

502
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:13,560
I won't meet any random person.
Get lost!

503
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,601
- I'm sorry, Your Highness.
- Wait.

504
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,837
(Xu)

505
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,457
(Xu)

506
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,760
Bring her in.

507
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:35,641
- I want to see how she will help me.
- Yes.

508
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:49,601
Who are you?

509
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:51,841
Your Highness,

510
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:54,040
thank you for helping me out
in Zuiyun Tower that day.

511
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:08,800
Thank you, Your Highness!

512
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,401
Stand up to speak.

513
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:14,480
Thank you.

514
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
How presumptuous! Is this
the place you are supposed to sit?

515
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,480
As a commoner, I know

516
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:28,800
this seat is reserved
for your trusted follower.

517
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,720
But I also know

518
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,961
that he has been killed
by Shen Danqing and Xu Chengfeng.

519
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:35,361
Now that he is gone,

520
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,280
don't you wish to find a replacement?

521
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,121
Like you?

522
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,401
What abilities do you have to assist me?

523
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:49,240
Actually,

524
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,961
I have always been concerned

525
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:52,480
about your struggle with Xu Chengfeng.

526
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,760
On the surface, Xu Chengfeng seems
to be winning,

527
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:58,201
but in reality, there is a big flaw
by his side,

528
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:01,601
which makes his fall the more severe
the higher he climbs.

529
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,320
What flaw?

530
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:05,520
Shen Danqing.

531
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:06,720
Oh?

532
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,520
I know the secret
of Shen Danqing's identity.

533
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,401
The current Shen Danqing

534
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,280
is actually masqueraded by Luo Ailian.

535
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:15,720
Luo Ailian, the patricide.

536
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,000
If we can prove that she is
in collusion with Xu Chengfeng,

537
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,121
it would help you

538
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:22,361
turn defeat into victory.

539
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,760
Do you have evidence
to prove what you have just said?

540
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,361
If not, it's nothing but nonsense.

541
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,760
And toying with me will make you pay.

542
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,961
I have personally verified it.

543
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,121
It's absolutely true.

544
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:40,000
It's just that my words carry no weight
due to my low status.

545
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,520
But your status is esteemed.

546
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:45,161
Wouldn't it be easy
for you to present evidence?

547
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,320
Please believe me.

548
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:53,080
Don't miss this great opportunity
to deal with Xu Chengfeng.

549
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,280
Is what you've said true?

550
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:03,800
Every word of mine is the truth.

551
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,520
What audacity!

552
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,040
Do you take me for a fool?

553
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:24,601
I know that you are an enemy
of Shen Danqing.

554
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,441
So you want me to be your weapon.

555
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,040
- Guards. Drag her out and drown her.
- Yes.

556
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:30,800
Your Highness!

557
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,921
I am telling the truth.

558
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:32,720
Your Highness,

559
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
I am telling the truth!

560
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:35,480
His Highness!

561
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,881
Everything I've said is the truth.

562
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:37,760
(Your Highness!)

563
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:38,760
(Your Highness!)

564
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:43,480
She jumped down here last night.

565
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,760
Why did she do that?

566
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,841
Excuse me.

567
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,040
What a pity!

568
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,161
So, have you found Luo Xue'er?

569
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:54,800
Miss Shen,

570
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,480
Luo Xue'er is dead.

571
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,441
Dead?

572
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,681
After Luo Xue'er ran away last night,

573
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,601
she must have gone to seek Prince Yi.

574
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,601
Presumably, she failed to find refuge
and angered Prince Yi.

575
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:05,881
In anger, Prince Yi

576
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:06,961
ordered guards to drown her.

577
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,361
Was there a body?

578
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,560
I went to the lake

579
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:11,800
and saw people
move her body out of the water.

580
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:13,240
It was Luo Xue'er indeed.

581
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:23,800
Dead? She is dead?

you laid hands on me,

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,801
everything changed.

597
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:41,200
And because of you,

I am forced to live as someone else.

599
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I used all my strength to seek revenge.

600
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,480
But just when my revenge
was about to succeed,

601
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,680
you died so quietly.

602
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:18,241

I heard the news.

616
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,801
Luo Xue'er was drown in the lake.

617
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:24,921
Your vengeance is fulfilled.

618
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:30,120
After countless trials,
you've finally got your wish.

619
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:34,921
Now you can freely
do what you want to do.

620
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,480
Perhaps this was destined for me.

621
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:42,040
I became Shen Danqing

622
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,600
and determined to take revenge.

623
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,721
Under my carefully laid plans,

624
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,241
Uncle Jizhou

625
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,200
and Ms. Zhou

626
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:50,321
both received the punishment
they deserved.

627
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,241
Luo Shuangshuang also had her regrets.

628
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:56,881
But Luo Xue'er...

629
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:03,401
I never expected
everything would end here.

630
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:06,321
I understand how you feel.

631
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,361
How could I let my future wife
suffer such grievances?

632
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,241
Through thick and thin,

633
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,680
we've done the impossible many times.

634
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,841
No matter how hard it
is to restore your reputation,

635
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,401
I will seek justice for you.

636
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,000
Luo Xue'er is already dead,

637
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:32,480
leaving no evidence.

638
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,921
There's no way
to clear Luo Ailian's name now.

639
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:42,120
Forget it.
Perhaps it's fate's arrangement.

640
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,841
Me becoming Shen Danqing
and being involved in the map affair

641
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:48,120
allowed you and me to meet again.

642
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:52,680
I should also thank fate

643
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:54,401
for bringing you to my side

644
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:55,680
and letting us be together.

645
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,801
But I'm not your future wife.

646
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:12,721
Still want to deny it? Come with me.

647
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,520
Do you know

648
00:38:31,881 --> 00:38:33,560
that the wishes
I made here have all come true?

649
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,120
What wishes did you make?

650
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:38,881
Why not find them?

651
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,040
There are so many wishes here.
How do we find them?

652
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,600
When I thought Luo Ailian died,

653
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,761
I put up a wishing plaque for her.

654
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,160
Wishing her
an innocent and carefree next life

655
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,000
of peace and happiness.

656
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,881
Heavens let me meet Luo Ailian again,
who was reborn from the flames,

657
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,200
providing me the opportunity
to fulfill my wish.

658
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:23,640
Danqing, from now on, I wish to stand
by you through thick and thin

659
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:26,801
and to keep you safe and happy.

660
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,441
In fact,
during the temple fair that day,

661
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,321
I put up another wishing plaque

662
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:35,680
and made a mark on it.

663
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,401
Wishing Danqing to marry
the ideal husband in this life.

664
00:39:53,761 --> 00:39:54,560
From Xu Chengfeng.

665
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:00,241
But this wish hasn't come true yet.

666
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,321
It will come true.

667
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,401
Life is like a dream.

668
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:08,600
The joy is limited.

669
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,520
Whether you are Shen Danqing

670
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,921
or Luo Ailian,

671
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,200
I'll treat you with the same sincerity.

672
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,600
And you are the one I love.

673
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:21,000
Danqing,

674
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,640
- will you marry me?
- No.

675
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:29,841
Why?

676
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:31,361
The same sincerity?

677
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:33,241
When we first met,

678
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:34,680
you were very picky with me.

679
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,600
Why should I treat you
with the same sincerity?

680
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:38,761
Are you holding a grudge?

681
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,721
Alright, then what should I do
to earn your forgiveness?

682
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:46,560
Here is your 'punishment':

683
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,640
Accompany me to travel
when I want to have fun.

684
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,841
Keep me company and daydream
when I'm bored.

685
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:54,361
And when I'm happy,

686
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,600
join me in laughter.

687
00:40:55,761 --> 00:40:56,841
When I'm sad, drink my sorrows

688
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:58,801
away with me.

689
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,680
How does this not sound
like a punishment

690
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,120
but more like a reward?

691
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:06,120
So do you accept or not?

692
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:08,881
Since you are magnanimous,

693
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:10,921
of course, I accept it.

694
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:15,401
However, my family has a few conditions
for taking a bride.

695
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,441
I wonder if you are willing to agree.

696
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,841
Let's hear it.

697
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm not good with money.

698
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:28,640
So I want to give you
my entire monthly salary

699
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,441
for you to manage.

700
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,441
I wonder if you'll find it tiresome.

701
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:35,520
I don't like social engagements.

702
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,801
After work,

703
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,080
I want to stay at home and be with you.

704
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,761
I wonder if you would like it.

705
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,801
I'm not one to have strong opinions.

706
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,801
So, you will make decisions
on big and small matters at home.

707
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,881
I wonder if you will
find that bothersome.

708
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,000
I must say you learn quite quickly.

709
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:03,241
In fact, I don't have much to give you.

710
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,480
I can't make you the wealthiest

711
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:11,640
or the most distinguished woman
in the world.

712
00:42:12,721 --> 00:42:14,160
But I will give you my all.

713
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:17,241
I will consult you on everything.

714
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,881
And will put your feelings and thoughts

715
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,761
above my own.

716
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,560
Will you marry me?

717
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,961
Whether I am Luo Ailian

718
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,361
or Shen Danqing,

719
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,241
I am fortunate
