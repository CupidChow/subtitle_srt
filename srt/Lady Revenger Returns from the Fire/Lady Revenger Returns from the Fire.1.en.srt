1
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:29,440
(Meet me in the boudoir at Hai hour's
third quarter. Luo Ailian)

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,480
(Truth can be buried in darkness.)

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,880
(Flesh can be devoured by flames.)

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,880
(But faith will not.)

5
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,799
(The wind will
plant the seeds of truth.)

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,920
(Time will make it sprout.)

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,960
(I will never give in to fate.)

8
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,640
(One day,)

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,079
(I will show up again)

10
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,799
(and claim everything
that once belonged to me.)

11
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:19,008
=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

12
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:22,240
=Episode 1=

13
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,039
Her face is finally restored.

14
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,159
I left the severe burn unattended

15
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,719
on the back of her neck as you said

16
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,039
and covered it up with a lotus tattoo.

17
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,599
It's been so long.

18
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,639
You are finally able to speak.

19
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,360
Now can you tell me

20
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,199
who you really are?

21
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,039
(The eldest daughter
of the Luo family from Ganlu Brewery.)

22
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,360
(Luo Ailian.)

23
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,144
(One month ago)

24
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,879
According to the divination,

25
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,159
the fate of the sisters in your family

26
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,000
will change drastically

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,560
because of a man.

28
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
(Luo Ailian, eldest sister)
Is the drastic change

29
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,599
a blessing or a curse?

30
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,800
Fortune and misfortune are intertwined.

31
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,479
Each coin has two sides.

32
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,840
Some things may seem good,

33
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,360
(but they may not be beneficial.)

34
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,599
(Some things may sound bad,)

35
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,400
(but they may turn for the better.)

36
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,800
(It all depends)

37
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,240
(on what you choose, Miss.)

38
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,199
Ailian.

39
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,360
Did the fortune-teller say

40
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,160
(Luo Xue'er, second sister)
that our future

41
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,879
is tied to one man?

42
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,560
How do you know?

43
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,439
This fortune-teller

44
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,639
is fooling us with the same story?

45
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,480
He offered to "ward off disasters"

46
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
and deceived the three of us.

47
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,319
He even conned Shuangshuang

48
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,319
to waste a fortune

49
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,519
on a marriage talisman.

50
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,360
Miss Ailian.

51
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,120
Something's wrong.

52
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,439
Miss Shuangshuang
hurried home in the carriage.

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
It seems like
Young Master Du is coming to visit.

54
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:57,199
(Luo Residence)

55
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,480
- Madam Zhou.
- Madam Zhou.

56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,680
Hurry up.

57
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,839
- Understood.
- Understood.

58
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,839
Why aren't you preparing things

59
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,920
in the front hall?

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,800
Master.

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
(Madam Zhou, Luo Jida's Concubine)

62
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,800
I was going to
ask Young Master Du if he has

63
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,959
any dietary restrictions.

64
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,439
Young Master Du must be

65
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,240
(Master, Luo Jida)
seeking marital ties with us.

66
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,560
Don't ruin this.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
I am well aware of its significance.

68
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,279
You may be a concubine,

69
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,199
but you should care for Ailian too.

70
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,120
Her mother died young.

71
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,160
And Xue'er

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,600
is also your daughter.

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,519
You mustn't favor Shuangshuang

74
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,079
and make Xue'er feel distant.

75
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Yes, Master.

76
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:37,160
(Luo Shuangshuang, third sister)

77
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,600
Miss, should I hang up
the marriage talisman?

78
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Be careful.

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,759
Understood.

80
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,160
You wretched maid!

81
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,519
What's wrong with you?

82
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,199
Are you trying to ruin my marriage?

83
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,720
I paid a good price for this.

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,439
Did you do it on purpose?

85
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:53,839
Tell me!

86
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,839
Who has upset my daughter again?

87
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Mother.

88
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,040
She broke my marriage talisman

89
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
to spoil my marriage.

90
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
No, Miss Shuangshuang.

91
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,160
It was an accident.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,079
How dare you talk back?

93
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
You may leave now.

94
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:06,839
Yes, Madam.

95
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,160
Sit.

96
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,319
Just tie it back together.

97
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,680
Get dressed up

98
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,600
and meet Young Master Du.

99
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,040
Mother.

100
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,720
You should have sent someone

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,279
to inform me at the temple earlier.

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,519
I could have had more time to dress up.

103
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,639
It's not too late.

104
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,000
As long as
you leave a good impression on him

105
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,120
before the other two come back,

106
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,480
I will help you secure this marriage.

107
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,480
Mother, you're the best.

108
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,079
Young Master Du.

109
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,839
(Du Ruoshan, Young Master)
Toast to you.

110
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,079
Master Jida, you are too kind.

111
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,959
Thank you, Master Jizhou.

112
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,680
Here.

113
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,399
Master, try the dishes.

114
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,279
Alright.

115
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,160
Father.

116
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,000
I just acquired a nice tea

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,560
called "Silver Needle",

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,920
which benefits the lungs.

119
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,279
Have some to suppress the alcohol.

120
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:02,839
Alright.

121
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
Shuangshuang is a good girl.

122
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,360
She always thinks of you

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,040
whenever she gets something good.

124
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,160
She noticed that my knot was worn out

125
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,279
and made me a new one right away.

126
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,560
Master.

127
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,240
Look at her.

128
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,759
Her eyes are red from that.

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,279
What an exquisite knot.

130
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,560
I'm deeply moved by your filial piety.

131
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,000
If you like it,

132
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,519
I can make a few for you.

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,519
Why don't you help me
with something else?

134
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,199
Master Jida mentioned

135
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,879
that Ganlu Brewery is producing

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
an even smoother rice wine.

137
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,319
I'd get some for my father.

138
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,879
Please tell me the name of the wine.

139
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,560
The wine...

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,040
The wine is called...

141
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,199
It's called Spring Eternal.

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,120
Let me introduce you.

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,480
This is my eldest daughter, Ailian.

144
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,759
My second daughter, Xue'er.

145
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,399
Greet Young Master Du.

146
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
Greetings, Young Master.

147
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:02,959
Young Master Du.

148
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,720
Our Moonlit Encounter would

149
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,120
suit your father better.

150
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,079
Thank you for the recommendation.

151
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,480
May I presume to inquire

152
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,720
what wine Master Jizhou is drinking?

153
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,800
It contains the Crystal Brew
from Sha City

154
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,920
and Ganlu Brewery's Zhuyeqing.

155
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,159
I guess

156
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,080
it's concocted by an expert like you,

157
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,080
Young Master Du.

158
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,200
I'm really impressed, Miss Ailian.

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,039
Ailian knows wine

160
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,960
and how to brew it.

161
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,600
(Luo Jizhou, Second Master)
The Spring Eternal and Moonlit Encounter

162
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,279
were her creations.

163
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,279
And the names are also elegant.

164
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,960
Your talent and beauty
are truly admirable.

165
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,799
You got it wrong.

166
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,120
These two unique names

167
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,679
were given by Xue'er.

168
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
The Spring Eternal and Moonlit Encounter

169
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,200
are selling well because of her.

170
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,320
What a remarkable talent, Miss Xue'er.

171
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you for your appreciation.

172
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,559
It's been a long time since we had

173
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,360
such a lively occasion at home.

174
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,200
Ailian, Xue'er, take your seats.

175
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,200
Take a seat.

176
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,679
- Sit.
- Come.

177
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,840
Look at my three filial nieces.

178
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,240
It makes a bachelor like me so envious.

179
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,159
Jida, I'll toast to you.

180
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,440
(Luo Residence)

181
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,080
I don't care.

182
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,799
You just met. Nothing's for sure yet.

183
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,080
Don't be so impatient.

184
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,720
Young Master Du
has sent that wretch a gift.

185
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,840
How can I stay calm?

186
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,879
What can we do?

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,360
You're obsessed with
your rouge and face powder

188
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,720
and never learn to brew wine.

189
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,440
That's why you've lost face

190
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,799
and angered your father.

191
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,399
Father values his dignity

192
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,440
and didn't even back me up.

193
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,440
Has he lost his mind?

194
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,799
Shut up.

195
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,120
Your father has always favored Ailian

196
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,679
and wants her to take over the brewery.

197
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,000
If he heard that nonsense you just said,

198
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,120
you won't ever
get a share of the property.

199
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,320
Mother.

200
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,039
I've worked hard without complaint

201
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,720
and served him humbly for years.

202
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,039
And I took great care of Luo Ailian.

203
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,360
But he just won't make me his wife.

204
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,559
He doesn't make plans for us.

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,559
So we have to rely on ourselves.

206
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,240
Mother, you must help me.

207
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,720
Stay in your room and rest.

208
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,320
I will figure something out.

209
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,759
Okay.

210
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,600
No.

211
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,159
I can't wait any longer.

212
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,399
The fortune-teller said

213
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,679
that it is up to me.

214
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,240
I can't lose to Luo Ailian.

215
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,559
Bin, return the pastries
to Young Master Du.

216
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,279
Miss, why would you reject him?

217
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,360
Heard the song Xue'er just sang?

218
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,440
Link the first characters of each line.

219
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,759
Love, yet no promised time.

220
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,559
Ruoshan, my love.

221
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,879
Miss Xue'er is fond of Young Master Du!

222
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,200
Yeah.

223
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,080
Xue'er has had a tough time here
over the years.

224
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,799
Madam Zhou may be her biological mother,

225
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,320
but she favors Shuangshuang.

226
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,240
Xue'er gets along with me.

227
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,879
And it makes Madam Zhou

228
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,240
and Shuangshuang very mean to her.

229
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
But I care about her.

230
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,120
But Miss,

231
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,039
you have done your best
to look after her.

232
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,000
Young Master Du is a rare find.

233
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,279
Where can we

234
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,000
find someone like him again?

235
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,360
I'd rather

236
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,480
spend more time
with my father and manage

237
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,879
our family business
than getting married.

238
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,639
If Young Master Du loves Xue'er back,

239
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,679
and Xue'er marries into the Du family,

240
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,480
I'll be truly happy.

241
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,320
Yes, Miss.

242
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,440
Young Master Du.

243
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,720
Young Master Du.

244
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,840
Stop there.

245
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,000
Father.

246
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,639
A single young lady

247
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,200
is lingering outside

248
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,720
a man's room late at night.

249
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,679
What a disgrace!

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,679
Father, I didn't.

251
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,759
You're a lady now.

252
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,919
Settle down

253
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,639
and learn from your sisters.

254
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,360
Naturally, I don't know
how to please you

255
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,240
as well as my sisters.

256
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,624
How dare you talk back?

257
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,399
Listen.

258
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,840
From now on,

259
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,039
go to the Ganlu Brewery
and learn brewing at night

260
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,399
in Ailian's stead.

261
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,480
Back with me.

262
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,679
Father!

263
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,799
Come in.

264
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:44,482
(The poem written by Luo Xue'er)

265
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,039
Mom, how come you're here?

266
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,679
Shuangshuang fancies

267
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,919
Young Master Du, so you should

268
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,480
help her win him over.

269
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,200
If your sister can marry
into the Du family,

270
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,159
she will surely look after you.

271
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,919
It's better than letting Luo Ailian
get the upper hand.

272
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,200
Mother, you finally came to see me

273
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,519
but it's for the sake of Shuangshuang.

274
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,559
It's also for your sake.

275
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,399
You think Luo Ailian will treat you
as one of her own

276
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,039
just because you butter her up?

277
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
But once Shuangshuang
marries Young Master Du,

278
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,000
I can surely marry you off

279
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,720
into a wealthy family with her help.

280
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,039
No need.

281
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,240
Do what's best for Shuangshuang.

282
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,519
Don't worry

283
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,960
about me.

284
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Don't tell me

285
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,039
that you also fancy

286
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,279
Young Master Du.

287
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,759
What if I say yes?

288
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,919
Will you make plans for me as you do

289
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,279
for Shuangshuang?

290
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,759
No wonder you teamed up

291
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,440
with Luo Ailian to bully your sister

292
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
at the family banquet.

293
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,080
When have I ever bullied her?

294
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,720
Both Shuangshuang and I
are your daughters.

295
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,120
Over the years,

296
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,960
whenever Shuangshuang is upset,

297
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,399
you become so anxious.

298
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,279
But have you ever cared

299
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,000
about how I am doing?

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,799
The title "Mother"

301
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,799
should be the most precious designation.

302
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,399
But those with biased affection
don't deserve it.

303
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,080
How dare you!

304
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:34,960
I'm warning you.

305
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,240
You'd better come around it
and side with us.

306
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,320
Otherwise,

307
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
there will be consequences.

308
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,320
Ailian...

309
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,559
Ailian, what happened?

310
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,159
Young Master Du...

311
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,759
He... He's dead.

312
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,320
Ailian, don't cry.

313
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,159
What happened?

314
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Just now,

315
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,559
he came to my room.

316
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,240
I will ask your parents

317
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,000
to marry you to me.

318
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,039
Thank you for your appreciation.

319
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,559
But our marriage

320
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,840
should abide by
the wishes of our parents.

321
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,879
Young Master, you should leave now.

322
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,519
I turned him down.

323
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,200
But he tried to force himself on me.

324
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,360
- Ailian.
- Young Master.

325
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,720
- Ailian.
- (I just pushed him a bit.)

326
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,399
Young Master Du.

327
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,360
Ailian!

328
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,359
He... He came into the room.

329
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,559
He was drunk.

330
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,480
And his face looked terrible.

331
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,519
Could it be

332
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,400
an ailment brought on by drinking?

333
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,680
No, I must inform Father.

334
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,519
- Notify the Du family's attendants.
- Ailian!

335
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,519
Think twice.

336
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,680
If Du Ruoshan died suddenly
from a hidden illness,

337
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,039
it has nothing to do with you.

338
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,359
But if people find out

339
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
that he died in your room,

340
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,920
they will surely think
you did something.

341
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,960
Then you won't be able
to clear your name.

342
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,400
What should I do then?

343
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,799
What should I do?

344
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,279
What if

345
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,160
he had died in his own room

346
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,759
and was discovered there?

347
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,920
Let's put him back where he ought to be.

348
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,319
Then no one will associate his death

349
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,920
with you.

350
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,640
Stop the carriage outside the door.

351
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,640
Follow me to the carriage in a bit

352
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,759
to move things down.

353
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,440
Get everything organized

354
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,079
and send them to Young Master Du's room.

355
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,799
Do you understand?

356
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,559
- Yes.
- Yes.

357
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,359
What should we do?

358
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,839
Let's hide him away.

359
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,400
What's that noise?

360
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,880
Who's there?

361
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,039
Who's there?

362
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,000
Who's it?

363
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,079
Who's it?

364
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,680
Who's it? Show yourself.

365
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,400
Who's there?

366
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,559
Alright. Stop looking.

367
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,240
It's probably just the cat
in this courtyard.

368
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,359
Get back to work.

369
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

370
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,319
(Luo Jida, come out!)

371
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,319
(Luo Residence)
Luo Jida!

372
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,079
Luo Jida!

373
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,400
Give me back my son!

374
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Master Du,

375
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,359
we are all deeply saddened
by your son's passing.

376
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,720
The coroner has examined his body.

377
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,039
Why don't we have the coroner

378
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,200
tell you the results of the examination?

379
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,920
The body's lips are purple,
and the veins are swollen.

380
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,279
I deduce

381
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,680
that Young Master Du must have died
from an angina attack.

382
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,680
(Master Du, Du Ruoshan's father)
My son was young and in good health.

383
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,680
Master Du, you may not know
that angina can be very deceptive.

384
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,200
The patient can suffer from it
for a long time without knowing.

385
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,920
Once they drink too much
or become emotionally agitated,

386
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,759
it could trigger an episode
that endangers their life.

387
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,359
The coroner is hired by your family.

388
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,839
He's only acting
according to your wishes, Luo Jida.

389
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,880
If you

390
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,920
don't trust the coroner hired by us,

391
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,000
you can hire someone else
to perform the autopsy.

392
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,400
The fact that your son
died of angina in his own room

393
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,680
is indisputable.

394
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,720
I hope you can accept the inevitable.

395
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,039
Accept the inevitable?

396
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,759
My son died at your residence.

397
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,960
None of you
can be absolved of involvement!

398
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,039
Guards! Let them pay with their blood!

399
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,480
Father!

400
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,559
This is General Xu Chengfeng,

401
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,359
who supervises the security
of Liao City.

402
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,319
Who dares to move?

403
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:38,656
(General Xu Chengfeng of Dafeng)

404
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,799
Ruoshan...

405
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,839
My son...

406
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,720
(Tianhao, General's Guard)

407
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,759
The coroner was right.

408
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,240
Young Master Du died
from an angina attack.

409
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,519
My son...

410
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,160
Master Du, the case

411
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,599
of a father losing his son

412
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,400
is indeed a great pain in life.

413
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,680
I hope you can accept the inevitable.

414
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,759
And don't let this matter

415
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,759
harm the many years of affection
between our families.

416
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,279
It's true that Young Master Du
died from angina.

417
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,839
But there is something
that cannot yet be explained.

418
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,400
When a person is injured in life,
their veins constrict,

419
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,720
showing obvious bruises.

420
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,240
But if injured after death,

421
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,839
their veins do not constrict,

422
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,319
so there will be no bruises.

423
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,279
Young Master Du
had two wounds on his feet.

424
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,559
Though there are marks,
there are no bruises.

425
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,839
This indicates that they were made
shortly after death.

426
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,759
Please enlighten us, General Xu.

427
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,960
Given the shapes,

428
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,039
they must have been
bumped by some round object.

429
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,599
And on the boots,

430
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,599
there are stains left
from being dragged.

431
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:09,960
It suggests that the body

432
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,240
was very likely moved by someone.

433
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Under the urgent circumstances
of transporting the corpse,

434
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,480
there were still mishaps.

435
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,079
It suggests
the person who transported it

436
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,519
lacks strength.

437
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,279
And it is very likely

438
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,519
that it was a woman.

439
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,720
How Young Master Du's injuries
were formed is only conjecture for now.

440
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,039
But it is certain that he died
from an angina attack.

441
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,799
Since the cause of his death
is already conclusive,

442
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,960
I hope you will not continue
to stir up trouble.

443
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,920
If there are any doubts,

444
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,119
you can go to the authorities.

445
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,880
Master Du,

446
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,720
I'm sorry for your loss.

447
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
My son...

448
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,440
Du,

449
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,680
I am willing

450
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,920
to hand over the deed to our estate

451
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,200
and all of Ganlu Brewery's revenue
for the next three years

452
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,839
as compensation to your family.

453
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,359
My son was a person of talent!

454
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,440
Even Prince Yi held him in high regard.

455
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,720
He was my life!

456
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,480
How could he just die in your residence
without any explanation?

457
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,440
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

458
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,839
Du,

459
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,799
what do you expect me to do?

460
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,559
I give you one day.

461
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,440
Tomorrow,

462
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,599
you must give away a daughter

463
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:57,200
to be buried with my son
as his wife as compensation.

464
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,400
Otherwise,

465
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,039
I will stop at nothing

466
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,279
and ensure your family
will never have peace!

467
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,920
What? A ghost marriage?

468
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,960
Rest assured.

469
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,039
I'll protect you,
even at the cost of my life.

470
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,559
I won't let you sacrifice your lives.

471
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:17,880
Father,

472
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,880
actually, it does involve me.

473
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,079
Last night,

474
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,200
Du Ruoshan suddenly came
to my room to propose marriage.

475
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,440
After I refused, he...

476
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,480
He actually tried
to force himself on me.

477
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,440
During our struggle,
he had an attack of angina.

478
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,119
He was such a beast!

479
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,079
Father, hasn't the general
already made a decision?

480
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,160
Maybe we should report this
to the authorities.

481
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,720
The Du family
is powerful and influential.

482
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,160
And now we have no evidence.

483
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,839
If this goes on,

484
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,000
they might slander you

485
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,960
and accuse you
of seducing Young Master Du.

486
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,559
By then, your name
will be completely ruined.

487
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,680
I will never let you
enter into a ghost marriage.

488
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,640
Just stay out of this.

489
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,839
I've already got an idea.

490
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,279
(He won't allow Luo Ailian
to have a ghost marriage.)

491
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,880
(Would he be thinking of making me
or Luo Xue'er replace her?)

492
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:21,079
(Luo Ailian and Luo Xue'er
are covering for each other.)

493
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,279
(Father has always been biased
towards Luo Ailian.)

494
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,839
(If he listens
to that vile woman's instigation)

495
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,440
(and decides to sacrifice me,
that would be terrible.)

496
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:55,279
(Meet me in the boudoir )

497
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,839
(at Hai hour's third quarter. Luo Ailian)
(Let's pretend nothing happened tonight.)

498
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,440
Young Master, you should leave now.

499
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,680
Don't worry.

500
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,519
Your father holds me in high regard.

501
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,400
As long as our hearts are one,

502
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,880
he will not refuse.

503
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,000
But our hearts were never one.

504
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,680
What?

505
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,319
Then why did you send me a note
to meet you here?

506
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,680
A note?

507
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,720
What note?

508
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,799
The note you wrote yourself.

509
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,880
After I came here,

510
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,079
you then pretended
to be completely unaware of it.

511
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
I'd like to know

512
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,240
what kind of trick you're playing

513
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,559
with all this pretense.

514
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,359
Young Master Du!

515
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,559
- Ailian!
- You are drunk!

516
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,680
- Young Master!
- Ailian.

517
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,519
- Young Master!
- (I really like you!)

518
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,640
This fragrance...

519
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,079
Shuangshuang hates the smell
of ink and doesn't enjoy writing.

520
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,799
Father specially made
perfumed ink for her.

521
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,640
Could it be her?

522
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:05,559
(General's Mansion)

523
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,799
Are all the files mentioned
by the senior official prepared?

524
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,680
Some files still aren't.

525
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,119
Who is it?

526
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,039
He took poison.

527
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,400
Whoever can afford to train
men of sacrifice is not ordinary.

528
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,480
On the surface, you came to Liao City

529
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,200
to maintain public order.

530
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:36,960
In fact, you came to look

531
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,920
for the royal treasure map
lost six months ago.

532
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,279
But as soon as we arrived,

533
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,079
someone tracked us here.

534
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,680
They acted too fast.

535
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,119
So, our actions in Liao City from now on

536
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,839
must be even more cautious.

537
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,039
(Given the shapes,)

538
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,559
(they must have been bumped)

539
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,792
(by some round object.)

540
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,079
Young Master Du.

541
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,680
Who?

542
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,279
You mean this injury resembles

543
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,319
those of Young Master Du's?

544
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,640
That's right.

545
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,759
Young Master Du's wounds

546
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,799
were very likely caused
by cobblestones as well.

547
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,039
Alright.

548
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,119
It seems we need to make a trip
to Luo Residence.

549
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,559
(Miss Ailian, they have gone out.)

550
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,640
(Okay.)

551
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
It is this very scent.

552
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:15,776
(Meet me in the boudoir at Hai hour's
third quarter. Luo Ailian)

553
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,599
(Indeed, it was her.)

554
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,000
Every night,

555
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,119
I would go to Ganlu Brewery
to inspect the wine vats.

556
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
The impostor must know this.

557
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,160
That's why they lured Du Ruoshan
to my room.

558
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,720
But yesterday,
the impostor did not show up.

559
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,960
There must have been an accident
preventing them.

560
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,759
Yes.

561
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,119
Last night, Miss Shuangshuang
was punished by Master

562
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,160
to learn winemaking.

563
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,279
Everyone knows Shuangshuang's
feelings for Du Ruoshan.

564
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,240
She must have thought that Du Ruoshan
was infatuated with me.

565
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,680
So she wanted to take advantage
of my routine at Ganlu Brewery

566
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:54,680
to lure Du Ruoshan to my room,
hoping to start an affair

567
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,759
and force him into marriage.

568
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,960
So, all these disasters

569
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,400
arose because of Miss Shuangshuang.

570
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,720
Bin, stay here.

571
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,160
I will go get Father and show him

572
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,599
so that she can't deny it.

573
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,200
Yes, Miss.

574
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:22,039
Father?

575
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,599
Father, are you there?

576
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:29,640
Father?

577
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,599
Father! Father!

578
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,119
What's wrong, Father?

579
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,960
General Xu, this way.

580
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,480
Father!

581
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,839
Father!

582
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,240
- Father!
- Father!

583
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,640
Step aside.

584
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,160
Father!

585
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:45,920
Father!

586
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:47,960
Father!

587
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,680
His mouth is open,
and his throat is swollen.

588
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,680
It looks like death by suffocation
due to an asthma attack.

589
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,480
His body is still warm.

590
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,519
He must have stopped breathing
not long ago.

591
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,519
Luo Ailian, you saw
that Father had an asthma attack.

592
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,008
Why didn't you call for help?

593
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,759
What on earth are you up to?

594
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,799
I just arrived...

595
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,279
You just got here, and Father died?

596
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,599
Is it such a coincidence?

597
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,119
The Du family wants you
to have a ghost marriage.

598
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:17,119
You were afraid Father would agree,
so you harmed him.

599
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,279
He was always good to you.

600
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,440
How could you harm your own kin?

601
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,279
Ghost marriage?

602
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,880
How do you know
about the ghost marriage?

603
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,440
Did you see Father earlier?

604
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,000
I didn't.

605
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,200
I heard it at the door of Father's room.

606
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,319
General Xu, my father
has just passed away.

607
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,759
Luo Ailian was the last one with him.

608
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,759
The murderer must be her.

609
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,799
- Luo Shuangshuang, that's nonsense.
- Enough!

610
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,799
Now that it comes to this,
I only have one question for you.

611
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:48,319
Did you move Du Ruoshan's body or not?

612
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,480
I...

613
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,599
He attempted

614
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,279
to force himself on me.

615
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,799
An accident happened
during our struggle.

616
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,519
I did that because I was scared.

617
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,000
For my own reputation,

618
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,240
I didn't want his body to be in my room.

619
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,640
But I really didn't kill him.

620
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,519
It was Luo Shuangshuang.
Her love for Du Ruoshan was unrequited.

621
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,200
So she forged my handwriting

622
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,240
and wrote a note to ask Du Ruoshan out.

623
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,640
That's why the tragedy happened.

624
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,680
Not only do you not know repentance,

625
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,440
now you even want to slander me
for killing Father.

626
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,119
What note?

627
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,359
This is all made up by you.

628
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,519
Who can testify?

629
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,319
Did you find the evidence in my room?

630
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,559
Bin is in your room now.

631
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,599
And she can testify.

632
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,279
General Xu,

633
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,920
the two of them
are in cahoots to harm me.

634
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,799
It's them.

635
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,599
They fabricated false evidence

636
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,319
and placed it in my room to frame me.

637
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,359
Luo Ailian, do you have a third witness?

638
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,319
Do you have one? Tell us.

639
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,200
General Xu, she is the one framing me.

640
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,759
She is the one who last appeared here.

641
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,880
Detain suspect Luo Ailian for now.

642
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,920
Do not release her
until the investigation is complete.

643
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,400
General Xu,

644
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,759
there is something odd
about my father's death.

645
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:06,960
Please investigate it.

646
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
If you are innocent,
you have nothing to fear.

647
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,400
Tianhao, take her to Luo Residence's
firewood room

648
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,840
and hand her over to the authorities
tomorrow morning.
