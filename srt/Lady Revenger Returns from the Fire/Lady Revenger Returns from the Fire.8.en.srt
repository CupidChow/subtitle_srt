1
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:18,880
=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,960
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:25,032
(Luo Residence)

4
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:26,922
The fortune-teller's words

5
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:28,762
have aroused Master Jizhou's suspicions.

6
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:31,281
Mother, calm down.

7
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:35,762
You are meticulous and astute.

8
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:38,721
(Master instructed you)

9
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:40,042
to prepare a clean set of tea utensils.

10
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:41,682
Just use plain water, not tea.

11
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:42,721
Do it carefully.

12
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:43,762
Don't make a mistake.

13
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,602
I'll take care of it.
You do your things.

14
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:52,194
(Alum, Star Anise, Salt)

15
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,562
(To think of adding alum to the water)

16
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:55,842
(to help the blood)

17
00:01:55,842 --> 00:01:57,202
(of Jizhou and Shuangshuang merge.)

18
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:00,482
Just a petty trick to muddle through.

19
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,682
But, after that,

20
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,602
I guess Uncle will no longer

21
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:06,042
have any doubts about it.

22
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:07,081
Mmm.

23
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:12,202
One more thing.

24
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:15,361
Since Uncle will no longer
doubt Shuangshuang's origins,

25
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,081
there's no point in keeping Ms. Li.

26
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,762
How should she be dealt with?

27
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:21,801
You mean...

28
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:30,681
Miss.

29
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:32,482
Early this morning, I inquired

30
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:34,442
of the servants
I got along with in the Luo's.

31
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:37,202
But they told me nothing had happened.

32
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,681
Nothing happened?

33
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:42,081
But Luo Jizhou

34
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,841
doesn't seem like someone
who can keep his cool.

35
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:45,561
He's bound to do something.

36
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:49,162
He would surely take
Luo Shuangshuang to verify it.

37
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:52,121
And the most direct way
is through a paternity test using blood.

38
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:55,042
If he finds out Luo Shuangshuang
is not his biological daughter,

39
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:57,722
he'd turn their mansion upside down.

40
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,681
But nothing has happened?

41
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:04,681
Could it be that someone else
in the mansion has interfered?

42
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,681
If the truth isn't verified,

43
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:12,521
Luo Jizhou

44
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:14,521
will only be more convinced

45
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,882
Luo Shuangshuang
is his biological daughter.

46
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:19,042
We couldn't find the midwife.

47
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:20,841
And the fortune-teller failed too.

48
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:23,322
What should we do?

49
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:27,521
The midwife.

50
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,002
She is our last hope.

51
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,202
Once she is no longer of use,

52
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,042
the Luo family will get rid of her.

53
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,282
So we just need
to follow their men closely.

54
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,322
Then we will be able to find

55
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:40,482
Ms. Li.

56
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:44,482
Enjoy.

57
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:50,922
General Xu, are you going
to join me for the farewell meal?

58
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,681
You're overthinking it.

59
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,961
This is just a normal meal.

60
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:00,801
As a woman,

61
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,282
you've made your way
to the leader of the black market,

62
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:04,922
known as Know-it-all.

63
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:07,521
Honestly, I admire you.

64
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:10,442
This is the cargo box
from Shen Escort Agency.

65
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:13,282
The lock hole here has been corroded
by the Dissolving Powder.

66
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,602
The item inside was stolen by someone
with exceptional lightness skills

67
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:20,282
who's also a master of poison.

68
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:21,962
So I'd like to inquire

69
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,602
about who this person really is.

70
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:27,561
How dare you!

71
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,121
The general is asking you.

72
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:29,801
Tianhao.

73
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:35,761
You don't have to tell me

74
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,121
if you don't want to.

75
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:40,561
After the meal,
Tianhao will escort you back.

76
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:41,842
I'm leaving.

77
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:46,984
Oh, right.

78
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:49,321
I sent the beggars
to a charity organization

79
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:50,801
offering food and shelter.

80
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,321
Later, they can also attend
a free school to study.

81
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:56,282
General Xu.

82
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:57,321
Thank you.

83
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,082
General Xu,

84
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:03,602
the first rule of the black market is

85
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,761
not to do business with the officials.

86
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,121
I must abide by it.

87
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:11,441
Okay.

88
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:13,162
I'll ask an unrelated question.

89
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:15,522
The girl I saved that day.

90
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,441
What did she come to you for?

91
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:22,121
She wanted me to find
a midwife surnamed Li.

92
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,001
A midwife surnamed Li.

93
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,282
Go back to have your meal.

94
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:34,801
General,

95
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:36,922
why are you asking
about Miss Shen again?

96
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,922
The esteemed young lady
of Shen Escort Agency

97
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,842
seeks information from the black market.

98
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:45,602
She is

99
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:47,162
really full of surprises.

100
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:49,962
I'm going to conduct
a thorough investigation.

101
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:57,681
He just sent her
the wound-healing cream to make nice.

102
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,162
And he's planning to investigate
Miss Shen again?

103
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,321
Wouldn't it be counterproductive?

104
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,441
So she's hidden in another mansion.

105
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:15,962
Act according to the plan.

106
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:17,441
Before the Luo family takes action,

107
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:18,962
we need to find Ms. Li.

108
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:19,681
Mmm.

109
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,042
What are you looking at?

110
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:29,482
Why is it you again?

111
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,842
I saw you having a conflict
with the beggars at the black market.

112
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:34,881
I thought you got involved
in some dangerous affair.

113
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:35,922
However,

114
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:38,001
you've come to eavesdrop
outside Luo's mansion.

115
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:39,602
Don't you have

116
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:41,082
anything better to do?

117
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:43,001
I'm working on official business,

118
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,482
and I just happened to come by.

119
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:46,801
Hurry on with your thing.

120
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:47,761
I've got some to do too.

121
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:50,082
I don't have the time to chat with you.

122
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:51,042
Well,

123
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,361
what I'm gonna take care of

124
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:53,441
is you.

125
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:55,121
Miss.

126
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,761
The general is gonna take care of you.

127
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:03,121
Shuixian, you make it sound strange.

128
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:07,042
I'm here to save someone.
There's no time to waste.

129
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,561
The Luos want to kill Ms. Li.

130
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,922
I'm afraid they might be
making a move inside right now.

131
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:13,441
Murder cases happen
to be my responsibility.

132
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:15,441
What are you doing?

133
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:16,602
Don't shout.

134
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:18,522
Let go of me.

135
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:19,201
How dare you!

136
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,561
General Xu is here. What are you doing?

137
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:23,336
Run!

138
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:24,602
I was freaked out.

139
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:25,768
Heavens.

140
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:26,561
Ms. Li.

141
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:28,121
- The Luos want you dead.
- Lady.

142
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:29,962
If it weren't for us,
you'd be dead by now.

143
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,962
I don't need to spell it out, do I?

144
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:33,962
I'm not very smart,

145
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,922
but I can tell who means well to me

146
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,761
and who wants to harm me.

147
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:39,241
Thank you for saving my life. Thank you.

148
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,361
Tianhao, take Ms. Li back.

149
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:42,201
Yes.

150
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:43,962
Okay.

151
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:44,681
Miss.

152
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:51,042
Thank you.

153
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:52,441
You're welcome.

154
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:53,761
Just taking a break.

155
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:56,482
Please.

156
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:01,361
(Zuiyun Tower)
Take care.

157
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,482
Take care.

158
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,162
Your invitation

159
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:15,681
wouldn't be a setup, would it?

160
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:17,642
Master Jizhou,

161
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:18,602
please, have a seat.

162
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:23,602
Go ahead.

163
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:25,082
What's the matter?

164
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:26,602
Master Jizhou,

165
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:28,042
take it easy.

166
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:29,241
Just two people

167
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,121
want to see you.

168
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:32,882
They want to tell you something.

169
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:36,122
Come in.

170
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:43,522
Ms. Li?

171
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:45,201
Master Jizhou,

172
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:47,441
help me.

173
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:48,642
What do you mean by that?

174
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:51,642
Actually, Miss Shuangshuang
was not a full-term baby.

175
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:53,441
She was a preterm baby
born in the seventh month.

176
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,481
Madam instructed me to tell you

177
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:57,841
that Miss Shuangshuang
was born at full term.

178
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,681
She also promised to repay
my gambling debts for me.

179
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:02,801
So I believed her and deceived you.

180
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,042
But she went back on her word.

181
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:06,801
She even sent someone
to the mansion I was in

182
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,002
to kill me!

183
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,081
She wants to kill you?

184
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:13,282
Master Jizhou, think about it.

185
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,282
It's not a big deal

186
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:16,762
that Miss Shuangshuang
was born prematurely.

187
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:19,042
But why would Madam Zhou
even want to kill someone

188
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,042
just to hide it from you?

189
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:21,882
I have served her for so many years.

190
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,122
She appears to be virtuous and good.

191
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,122
But in reality, she is more resolute
and ruthless than anyone.

192
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:29,721
As long as it benefits her,

193
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,441
she does anything.

194
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:32,882
Impossible.

195
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:35,242
I did a paternity test.

196
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:38,362
The blood merged.

197
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:41,762
It merged.

198
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,002
But did you check the water

199
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:45,362
used for the test?

200
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:47,122
All the people in the mansion

201
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:49,081
enticed Ms. Li to deceive you.

202
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:50,801
Of course, it was easy for them

203
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:52,882
to swap the water used
for the paternity test.

204
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:55,441
Impossible.

205
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:56,801
Impossible.

206
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:57,441
People

207
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:59,002
are always afraid to face the truth.

208
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,762
Especially those who are
inherently timid.

209
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:05,481
Master Jizhou,

210
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,922
don't tell me you'd rather be a coward

211
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:09,961
even if they make a fool of you.

212
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,321
Actually, it is very simple
to figure it out.

213
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:15,801
Just redo the test.

214
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:18,762
That's all I want to say.

215
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:20,762
It's up to you to decide.

216
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:23,481
Impossible.

217
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,122
This can't be.

218
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:27,922
How could this happen?

219
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,002
Impossible.

220
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:35,922
I told Luo Jizhou

221
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,201
all the truth.

222
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,042
His lifelong hope

223
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:40,522
is to have kids.

224
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:43,561
If he finds out that Luo Shuangshuang

225
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,162
is not his biological daughter,

226
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:46,721
he will not let her and her mother off.

227
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:51,201
And well,

228
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,922
those two women
are not easy to deal with.

229
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,721
They have become accustomed
to a life of luxury.

230
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,601
How could they give up

231
00:10:58,961 --> 00:11:00,721
the power they already have?

232
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,321
When the time comes,

233
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:03,922
they will surely turn on each other.

234
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:06,242
And then,

235
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,721
it will be our time to act.

236
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:12,762
I know you're strategic.

237
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,481
But there's a great risk involved,

238
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,561
especially considering

239
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,721
you are once again openly
opposing the Luo family,

240
00:11:19,282 --> 00:11:20,922
which will inevitably
arouse their vigilance.

241
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:22,601
You must be careful.

242
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:24,642
Mmm.

243
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:27,882
Zishan,

244
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:29,922
you should take care of yourself.

245
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:31,122
You look so pale.

246
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:32,721
Is something troubling you?

247
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:35,841
Nothing.

248
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:37,721
I just didn't sleep well.

249
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,640
(Luo Residence)

250
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:48,441
Miss Shuangshuang,

251
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,122
Master Jizhou wants you
to go to the Zuiyun Tower.

252
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:51,762
He only asked me to go?

253
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:52,520
Yes.

254
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,201
The carriage is waiting outside.

255
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:55,642
Please go.

256
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,681
Be careful.

257
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:00,961
There are no more issues, I guess.

258
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,841
Madam, Miss Xue'er.

259
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,601
Who has gone out?

260
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:07,042
Master Jizhou sent someone over

261
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,561
to take Miss Shuangshuang
to see him in the Zuiyun Tower.

262
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:12,522
Isn't he supposed

263
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:13,922
to be talking business
with Shen Danqing?

264
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,002
Does he need Shuangshuang?

265
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:17,841
Ms. Li disappeared.

266
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,441
Uncle asked Shuangshuang
to see him in the Zuiyun Tower.

267
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,002
Something's not right.
Prepare a carriage right away.

268
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,122
We'll go to the Zuiyun Tower.

269
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:25,224
Alright.

270
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:28,456
Father.

271
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:33,162
Father.

272
00:12:37,362 --> 00:12:38,122
Father.

273
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:44,321
Father.

274
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:55,441
Father.

275
00:12:55,882 --> 00:12:57,882
Your hand is bleeding.

276
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,002
They say you're not my daughter.

277
00:13:05,762 --> 00:13:07,321
They say you were born prematurely.

278
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,522
They say she didn't conceive
in the first month of that year.

279
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:15,481
Yes.

280
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,882
On the 15th day of that month,
I drank too much.

281
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,242
That was the night
I was with your mother.

282
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:23,481
It was that very night.

283
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,922
How could it be that easy?

284
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,321
Father, what's wrong? You look scary.

285
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,481
Give me some of your blood.

286
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:32,362
I just need a little bit.

287
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:33,242
I don't know anything.

288
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:34,242
To do a paternity test.

289
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:35,441
Father.

290
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:37,961
No!

291
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:55,522
You're really not my daughter.

292
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,441
That wretch deceived me!

293
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:02,162
I've treated you all so well.

294
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:04,601
I've given everything to you.

295
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,042
I even killed my own niece

296
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:08,561
for you.

297
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,642
I don't know anything.

298
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:10,882
Father, I know nothing.

299
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:12,642
Come back!

300
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:17,362
Look at this!

301
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:20,681
You call me Father.

302
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,162
Liars.

303
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,362
You are all liars.

304
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,002
Am I a coward?

305
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,681
I am no coward.

306
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:34,002
I will make your mother pay.

307
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:35,961
Those who dare to play me

308
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:38,201
will all pay the price!

309
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:07,841
Shuangshuang.

310
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,522
What?

311
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:13,561
What?

312
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,882
What's wrong, Shuangshuang?

313
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:18,961
What happened to your hand?

314
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,441
Uncle used my blood
to do a paternity test.

315
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,282
He told me
I wasn't his biological daughter.

316
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:26,922
And he tried to stab me like a madman.

317
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:28,081
I was so scared.

318
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,601
I grabbed the incense burner

319
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:31,481
and hit him with it, then he just...

320
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:34,522
Mother, what's going on?

321
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,721
Why did he suddenly become like this?

322
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:39,081
Shen Danqing and Ms. Li

323
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:41,282
told him the fact

324
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:42,321
that you aren't his daughter.

325
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,321
Shuangshuang,

326
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:46,721
it's okay now.

327
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:50,122
Your sister and I
will help you deal with it.

328
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,201
I'm not his daughter?

329
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:56,642
Didn't you say

330
00:15:56,642 --> 00:15:58,362
I was his biological daughter?

331
00:15:58,362 --> 00:15:59,721
Why is it not the case now?

332
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:01,561
I have my reason.

333
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,441
Your father died.

334
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:05,201
I had to find a new backer.

335
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:07,362
Ultimately, all I do is for you.

336
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:08,922
If you were determined to deceive him,

337
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:10,601
why didn't you tell me beforehand?

338
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,522
Do you realize
he almost killed me just now?

339
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:16,242
Calm down.
Just now when we went upstairs,

340
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,522
I saw Prefect Bai and his assistant

341
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:18,522
eating here.

342
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,162
Do you want to lead them all here?

343
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:21,042
Xue'er.

344
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,321
Do you have any ideas?

345
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:24,601
Sir,

346
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:26,681
the Maple Dew Tea you ordered is ready.

347
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,081
My goodness, someone's dead!

348
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:32,922
- What now?
- Dead!

349
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,122
- What do we do?
- Dead!

350
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:34,760
He saw it.

351
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,362
Calm down.

352
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,801
What if he tells Prefect Bai?

353
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:39,081
Take it easy.

354
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:40,522
Listen.

355
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,081
We need to coordinate

356
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:44,601
our stories in front of others later.

357
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:55,841
You look tired.

358
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:57,042
So I went to Mr. Miao

359
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,362
and got some calming herbs

360
00:16:58,561 --> 00:16:59,801
to make this wine for you.

361
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:01,601
I hope it can help you sleep.

362
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:04,802
I forgot you had this skill.

363
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:07,922
Thank you.

364
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:13,362
But this wine only treats
the symptoms, not the root cause.

365
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,162
I know what you're really worried about

366
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:19,041
is what Mr. Miao is investigating.

367
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:21,362
About your sister's poisoning.

368
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:23,001
How do you know?

369
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:26,562
When I went to get herbs just now,

370
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:28,322
I accidentally saw the postmortem report

371
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:29,842
(on Shen Danqing's poisoning.)

372
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,162
(And considering how you
and Mr. Miao look,)

373
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:33,122
(Postmortem Report)
(it's easy to guess)

374
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:34,201
what you are doing.

375
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:39,041
Zishan.

376
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,441
Do you still not trust me?

377
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:44,842
How could I not?

378
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,602
Don't keep anything from me anymore.

379
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:48,961
Family should share not only glory

380
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,602
but also hardship.

381
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:53,562
Zishan, believe me.

382
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:55,842
I'll stick with you

383
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,162
through thick

384
00:17:57,562 --> 00:17:58,362
and thin.

385
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:02,521
Young Master, Miss, something's wrong.

386
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,041
Prefect Bai and his men have

387
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,642
surrounded us with the women
of the Luo family.

388
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:06,642
Please come with me.

389
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,322
What brings you

390
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:21,961
and so many people here?

391
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:23,562
The Luo family claims

392
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:27,562
Shen Danqing murdered Luo Jizhou.

393
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,041
I've come to make an arrest.

394
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:30,681
Master Jizhou is dead?

395
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:31,721
Drop the act!

396
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:33,922
I went to the restaurant two hours ago

397
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:34,802
for Master Jizhou.

398
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:37,922
And as soon as I entered,
I found him dead.

399
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:40,162
You asked him to be in the private room.

400
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:41,802
You killed him!

401
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,602
My lord, here.

402
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:49,802
What is going on?

403
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:54,241
My lord, please stand up for me.

404
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:55,562
Two hours ago,

405
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,122
Master Jizhou was invited

406
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:58,521
by Shen Danqing here.

407
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:01,241
She has always been
at odds with our family.

408
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:03,041
My daughters and I were worried,

409
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,201
so we hurried over.

410
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:05,842
However, when we entered,

411
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:08,281
we saw Master Jizhou's body here.

412
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:09,642
Yes.

413
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:12,122
We were just about to report it
when the waiter arrived,

414
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:13,961
and he did it on our behalf.

415
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,961
Shen Danqing was just here?

416
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,241
The room was booked by Miss Shen.

417
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,521
Even if she met with Master Jizhou,

418
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:26,761
it doesn't prove she was the killer.

419
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:28,562
My lord, you don't understand.

420
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:31,441
Shen Danqing is from an escort agency
and is a savage.

421
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:33,521
She even used force
in our mansion before,

422
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:35,642
let alone in here.

423
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:37,281
My poor uncle.

424
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:39,001
He must have said something

425
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:40,241
to anger that shrew,

426
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,001
which brought disaster upon himself.

427
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:43,162
My lord,

428
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:46,122
now there are only
a few of us women in our family.

429
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:48,481
If you do not seek justice for us,

430
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:50,041
we will be left at the mercy of others.

431
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:52,562
If you stand up for us,

432
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:54,642
we will owe you a big favor.

433
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,681
Please stand up for us.

434
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:57,961
My lord.

435
00:19:58,201 --> 00:19:58,842
My lord.

436
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:00,122
Madam.

437
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,481
We will reward you

438
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:06,961
a lot.

439
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:08,882
Don't worry.

440
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:12,201
Mother.

441
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:15,281
It is my duty to redress
grievances for people.

442
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:15,882
I

443
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:18,521
will investigate thoroughly.

444
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:20,201
Yes.

445
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:28,642
My lord.

446
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,922
He seemed to be killed by a blow

447
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:32,241
to the head from a heavy object.

448
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:34,721
For more specific and detailed clues,

449
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:36,481
we need a coroner.

450
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,322
A heavy object?

451
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:38,322
Yes.

452
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:43,041
My lord, there used
to be a golden candlestick here.

453
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,281
But now it's missing.

454
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:45,512
My lord.

455
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:47,842
It must have been taken away
by the murderer.

456
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:50,162
Let's go to the Shen Mansion
now to search.

457
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,082
We may catch the killer
along with the weapon.

458
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:53,562
Yes.

459
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:55,281
Notify the constables and captors.

460
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:58,322
Send over two people to carry
the corpse to the morgue.

461
00:20:58,642 --> 00:21:00,961
The rest comes with me
to the Shen Mansion to catch the killer.

462
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:01,721
- Yes.
- Yes.

463
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:05,842
Shen Danqing,

464
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:07,922
you just have some conflicts

465
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:09,362
over business matters with my uncle.

466
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,122
I didn't expect you to be so venomous

467
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:12,441
that you even killed him.

468
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:13,642
I vehemently disagree.

469
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:15,882
Don't wrong her without evidence.

470
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:17,201
I didn't wrong her.

471
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:19,681
She was the last person
to appear in that room.

472
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:22,802
What a joke.

473
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:24,882
It was you people
who did not gain any advantage.

474
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:26,642
I did not suffer any loss.

475
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:28,201
Why would I kill him?

476
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:30,602
Let alone blatantly asking

477
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:33,082
Master Jizhou out to kill him.

478
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:38,521
Mr. Bai.

479
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:41,041
A murderer must repay with their life.

480
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:44,162
Please do justice for me.

481
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:45,362
My lord, please be sharp.

482
00:21:45,481 --> 00:21:47,001
I did invite Master Jizhou

483
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,362
to Zuiyun Tower to discuss something.

484
00:21:48,562 --> 00:21:49,761
But I did not kill him.

485
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:51,001
When I left,

486
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:52,521
he was still drinking there.

487
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:54,842
If we talk about someone suspicious,

488
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:56,441
nobody who entered

489
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,761
the room after I left

490
00:21:58,201 --> 00:21:59,441
can claim innocence.

491
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:07,922
I'd like to follow you to the yamen.

492
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:09,842
But Ms. Zhou

493
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,162
and the two young ladies should go too.

494
00:22:13,162 --> 00:22:13,802
Well...

495
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,521
Well,

496
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:23,681
Prefect Bai,

497
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:25,882
are you intending to shield some people?

498
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:30,642
Attendants.

499
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:31,272
Here.

500
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:32,681
Take the Shen siblings

501
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:33,961
along with the three Luos

502
00:22:34,322 --> 00:22:35,041
to await trial.

503
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:35,976
Yes.

504
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:37,681
Zishan, don't worry.

505
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:38,842
I am innocent,

506
00:22:39,162 --> 00:22:40,241
so I don't fear the court trial.

507
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:44,546
(Liao City Yamen)

508
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:48,360
Danqing,

509
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,562
I will go get Shuixian
and Ms. Li to testify for you.

510
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,362
They can only prove

511
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:55,441
I had a talk with Master Jizhou.

512
00:22:55,602 --> 00:22:56,922
That does not clear me of suspicion.

513
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:57,960
Moreover,

514
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:00,481
Prefect Bai is so biased
towards Ms. Zhou.

515
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:02,322
Let's watch and wait.

516
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:04,721
Do you have any ideas?

517
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,481
Luo Shuangshuang is arrogant.

518
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:09,681
But today,

519
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,241
she seemed somewhat uneasy.

520
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:13,521
(I also noticed a dent)

521
00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:14,681
(on her bracelet.)

522
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,122
As if it had knocked
against something hard.

523
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:19,162
It knocked against something?

524
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,922
She would never wear jewelry with flaws.

525
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:23,322
It must have just happened,

526
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:24,521
so she hasn't changed it.

527
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:28,441
She might have just had
a fight with someone.

528
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,441
A fight with someone.

529
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:32,936
Could it be

530
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:35,082
that she killed Master Jizhou?

531
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:37,562
So you had Prefect Bai

532
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:39,562
bring them along to the yamen

533
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:41,562
so that they wouldn't have time

534
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:42,521
to eliminate any traces.

535
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:43,761
Exactly.

536
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:45,281
If that's the case,

537
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:47,122
let's see what happens then

538
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:49,122
and make sure they
have no room for excuses.

539
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:53,642
Shen Danqing, do you admit your crime?

540
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,201
No, I don't.

541
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,362
But I know

542
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,562
who the murderer is.

543
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:59,322
Who is it?

544
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:02,721
These three are falsely
accusing us of what they did.

545
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:05,082
You're slandering us.
Do you have any evidence?

546
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,162
My lord, I request an autopsy.

547
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:09,761
By then, we will surely find

548
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:11,521
the evidence to prove
who the real culprit is.

549
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:13,441
Shen Danqing, quit stalling.

550
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:15,001
If there is evidence, present it now.

551
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:21,001
I'm not stalling.

552
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:23,961
An autopsy is the most just
and efficient method.

553
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:26,162
Only those who are guilty

554
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:27,802
are afraid of it.

555
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:31,721
My lord,

556
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,642
do you think my words make sense?

557
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:35,122
Well...

558
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:35,761
Mr. Bai,

559
00:24:36,122 --> 00:24:37,041
this is her trap.

560
00:24:37,562 --> 00:24:38,882
Do not agree to her rude request.

561
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:39,842
Mr. Bai,

562
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:41,281
if an autopsy isn't done,

563
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:43,241
even if you force a conviction
and close the case today,

564
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:44,602
our family has connections

565
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:45,721
in the capital city

566
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,041
and we won't just do nothing.

567
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:48,362
I'll report it

568
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:49,961
to the Emperor if I'm not satisfied.

569
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,041
Think about it, my lord.

570
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:53,281
Okay.

571
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,201
I grant you permission

572
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:57,001
to enter the morgue.

573
00:24:57,761 --> 00:24:58,562
To be fair,

574
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,922
Madam Zhou and the young ladies

575
00:25:00,922 --> 00:25:02,082
will go with you.

576
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:04,122
I will surely make the real culprit

577
00:25:04,122 --> 00:25:06,281
confess willingly.

578
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:07,241
Thank you.

579
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:09,001
Yes, my lord.

580
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:17,562
How come there is not even a guard?

581
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:18,362
Open the door.

582
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:19,281
Yes.

583
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,441
As long as on the body of Luo Jizhou,

584
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,281
we find the wound matching
the mark on her bracelet,

585
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,322
it'll be solid evidence

586
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,281
and they can't deny it.

587
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:34,761
Don't worry.

588
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:36,241
You went there just an hour

589
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:37,562
after Shen Danqing left.

590
00:25:37,842 --> 00:25:39,041
The scene has been cleaned up.

591
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:40,441
And the coroner will find nothing.

592
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:41,281
Yes.

593
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:43,082
Even if there really is something,

594
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,201
Mr. Bai will pick our side.

595
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:48,201
Hurry up.

596
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:49,162
My lord.

597
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:50,441
Cut the crap and open the door.

598
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:52,200
(Morgue)

599
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,362
Please, my lord.

600
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:55,001
My lord.

601
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,041
Where is the body of Luo Jizhou?

602
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:02,241
It is right...

603
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:04,521
Where is the body?

604
00:26:04,922 --> 00:26:06,201
How come the body is missing?

605
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:07,602
How can this be?

606
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,082
What's going on? Where's the body?

607
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:11,882
I have no idea.

608
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:13,082
My lord.

609
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:15,642
We were only charged
with transporting the body here.

610
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:17,882
The rest is the coroner's job.

611
00:26:17,882 --> 00:26:18,441
Well...

612
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:19,681
What do you mean?

613
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:20,922
I locked the door.

614
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:21,761
Stop arguing.

615
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:23,521
The body disappeared into thin air.

616
00:26:23,922 --> 00:26:25,761
All of you were completely unaware.

617
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:27,521
And you're now passing the buck.

618
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,122
In full view of everyone,

619
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:30,721
how am I gonna face others?

620
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,882
Go find the body.

621
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:32,882
- Yes.
- Yes.

622
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,041
Go search for the body.

623
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:35,162
How preposterous.

624
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:45,961
Mr. Bai,

625
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:49,041
with all due respect,

626
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:51,562
losing a body is no trivial matter.

627
00:26:52,082 --> 00:26:54,562
Shen Danqing is cunning
and good at sophistry.

628
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,602
If she spreads the word

629
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:57,562
and pins this on us,

630
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:58,642
you will be

631
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:01,041
charged with negligence.

632
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:03,362
I am well aware of the trouble.

633
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:06,441
That's why I've ordered
the constables to search for the body.

634
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,922
My lord, a word of advice.

635
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:10,602
Why not deal with the person

636
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:12,882
who brings trouble
instead of the trouble itself?

637
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:14,082
You mean...

638
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:16,441
You saw my uncle's body
with your own eyes.

639
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:17,681
And you got our testimony.

640
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:19,602
Whether Shen Danqing
admits guilt or not,

641
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:21,642
you have reason to convict her
and send her to prison.

642
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:23,441
As long as Shen Danqing is executed,

643
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:25,362
naturally, no one
will care about the body,

644
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:27,481
and the problem will be solved.

645
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:31,362
But what if Shen Zishan
presents a petition to the Emperor?

646
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:33,761
As long as she is executed
and all traces are erased soon,

647
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:35,241
even if an imperial inspector comes,

648
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,562
we can all serve as witnesses
who saw the body.

649
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:40,922
Then you can just find an excuse
to reply to the inspector.

650
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,322
That won't be difficult.

651
00:27:44,802 --> 00:27:45,521
Mr. Bai,

652
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:48,761
the priority is to find the body.

653
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,041
I will have
our armed escorts investigate it.

654
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:51,922
We are leaving

655
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:53,082
if there's nothing else.

656
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:54,082
Wait.

657
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:55,681
Shen Danqing,

658
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:58,562
I've fulfilled your request
to take you here.

659
00:27:58,681 --> 00:27:59,681
It's enough to show sincerity.

660
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:01,362
You are now a suspect

661
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:03,602
but can't provide evidence
to prove your innocence.

662
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:05,001
Confess now...

663
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:06,481
What an accusation!

664
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:09,162
Mr. Bai, don't try to frame her.

665
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:10,922
My lord.

666
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:13,721
My lord.

667
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:15,082
This was dug out

668
00:28:15,082 --> 00:28:16,162
in Shen's garden.

669
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:17,441
Please have a look.

670
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:20,441
My lord,

671
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:21,642
this is the candlestick

672
00:28:21,642 --> 00:28:22,961
that was lost from the room.

673
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,882
Shen Danqing,
now you can't deny it anymore.

674
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,642
You're the one who killed Master Jizhou.

675
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:34,122
Thank you.

676
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,681
Money talks.

677
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,521
Everyone, search thoroughly.

678
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,281
- Yes.
- Yes.

679
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:42,882
- Yes.
- Yes.

680
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:45,281
Boss, I found it.

681
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:49,041
Shen Danqing,

682
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,122
now that evidence
was found in your house,

683
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:52,521
you can't deny it anymore.

684
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:55,602
Shen Danqing of Shen Escort Agency

685
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:56,681
used a candlestick

686
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:59,162
in a room of Zuiyun Tower

687
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:00,721
to kill Luo Jizhou
due to a business dispute.

688
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:02,922
There are witnesses
and physical evidence. Arrest her.

689
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,322
Who dares?

690
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,241
Shen Zishan, are you resisting arrest?

691
00:29:07,562 --> 00:29:08,922
Do you want to be convicted too?

692
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,562
Not by a corrupt officer like you.

693
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:11,281
You!

694
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:14,281
Arrest them both.

695
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:16,721
Zishan, don't.

696
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:19,362
Finding the body
of Luo Jizhou is the key.

697
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:22,562
I will go with you.

698
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:24,241
This has nothing to do with my family.

699
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:25,362
Do not harm the innocent.

700
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:26,281
Take her away.

701
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:26,882
Yes.

702
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:27,481
Danqing.

703
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:28,744
Let's go.

704
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:29,521
Find the body.

705
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:45,001
(General's Mansion)

706
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:45,721
(General.)

707
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:47,322
General.

708
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,882
You're still in the mood
for tea and reading?

709
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:58,122
Take your time.

710
00:29:58,362 --> 00:29:59,441
I followed your orders

711
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,602
and handed over
the latest findings of the map

712
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:02,681
to the minister's messenger.

713
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:03,842
But the messenger said

714
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:05,241
Prince Yi impeached you

715
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:06,562
in the court during your absence,

716
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:07,721
saying you were incompetent.

717
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:09,761
Is that all?

718
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:12,961
We found the female bandit

719
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,362
and recovered the lost chest.

720
00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:16,481
This counts as progress, doesn't it?

721
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:18,201
How can he say you're ineffective?

722
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,082
He's twisting the fact.

723
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:21,122
Detestable.

724
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:23,041
It's not anything new.

725
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,761
Although Prince Yi
is crafty and insidious,

726
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:27,082
he's a good strategist.

727
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:28,616
Tianhao,

728
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,001
you must be extra cautious
in the coming days.

729
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:32,842
Alright.

730
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:43,122
(General's Mansion)
Prince Yi!

731
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,082
(Zong Wei, Prince Yi's adjutant)
Your Highness, we've arrived.

732
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:57,281
Alright.

733
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:01,721
General, Prince Yi has arrived.

734
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:15,802
Greetings, Your Highness.

735
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:17,241
Greetings, Your Highness.

736
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:26,602
(Prince Yi of the Dafeng Dynasty)

737
00:31:26,602 --> 00:31:27,281
General Xu,

738
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:30,241
we meet again.

739
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:32,521
May I ask what brings you here,

740
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:33,882
Your Highness?

741
00:31:34,201 --> 00:31:35,681
It has been over three months

742
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:37,802
since you came here
to investigate the case

743
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:39,322
of the lost cargo six months ago.

744
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:42,842
I recall you made a military pledge.

745
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:44,602
According to the law,

746
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:46,642
what punishment must those who fail

747
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,562
to fulfill a military pledge face?

748
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:54,690
(Morgue)

749
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:06,152
(Morgue)

750
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,602
(If Luo Jizhou was struck in the head,
he would bleed incessantly.)

751
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:22,642
(But there are only a few specks
of blood on this shroud.)

752
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:26,441
(Perhaps his injury)

753
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,521
(is not that severe.)

754
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:29,441
(Could it be he didn't die?)

755
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:12,122
(It seems Luo Jizhou is still alive.)

756
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:15,441
(Finding him would clear
Danqing of suspicion.)

757
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,322
(He has a head injury.)

758
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,082
(He must go to a clinic nearby
to get it treated.)

759
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,521
(Searching along this track)

760
00:33:30,602 --> 00:33:31,642
(will offer me clues.)

761
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:42,322
Luo Jizhou!

762
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:48,602
I made the pledge to Minister Lin.

763
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:50,761
Whether I have finished it or not

764
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,041
should be judged by him.

765
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:55,322
I heard a few days ago,

766
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,322
you impeached me in court.

767
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,602
His Majesty neither agreed
nor disagreed at that time.

768
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:02,001
It seems that he didn't want you
to intervene in this case.

769
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,162
But you did not give up

770
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:06,882
and even took the trouble to come here
to make things difficult for me.

771
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:09,641
You seem to be overly concerned

772
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:10,842
with my affairs, no?

773
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,362
I did it in return for you.

774
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:18,202
If it weren't for you always opposing me

775
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:21,242
and even meddling

776
00:34:21,242 --> 00:34:22,682
in my mansion expansion,

777
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:24,521
why would I be so interested

778
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,001
in your affairs?

779
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:29,081
I'm not interested
in your private matters.

780
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,722
But the expansion took the land

781
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:35,081
of my departed subordinate's wife.

782
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:37,041
I had no choice but to intervene.

783
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:42,121
You're too thoughtful

784
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,722
and preoccupied with too many concerns.

785
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:46,481
No wonder the progress
of the investigation is so slow.

786
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:49,441
His Majesty is tolerant
and has not blamed you.

787
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:53,882
But I must share His Majesty's worries.

788
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:59,802
I have sought a decree from His Majesty

789
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,802
to come to assist you.

790
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:04,722
Perhaps it can speed up
the investigation.

791
00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:07,762
Xu Chengfeng, please accept the decree.

792
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:10,561
It's been months since Xu Chengfeng
was transferred to Liao City.

793
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:12,121
But the case is progressing slowly.

794
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:14,362
Due to its complexity,

795
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,481
Prince Yi will go there

796
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:17,682
to assist in the case.

797
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,121
I hope they'll find out the truth soon.

798
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:21,722
I accept.

799
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:37,161
Ever since you left the capital city,

800
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:39,242
I have been very concerned.

801
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:42,121
I have repeatedly inquired
about you from His Majesty.

802
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,282
But I did not expect to see you so soon.

803
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:50,242
I am looking forward
to this cooperation very much.

804
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:51,961
Thank you

805
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:55,481
for repeatedly expressing concern
for me in the memorials to His Majesty

806
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:57,081
and even coming here

807
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,362
to lend me a hand.

808
00:35:58,682 --> 00:36:00,842
I will naturally take good care of you.

809
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:02,601
As for you,

810
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,882
do not mind me being in the way.

811
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:06,802
Don't say that, Your Highness.

812
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:09,121
I will cooperate with you.

813
00:36:09,561 --> 00:36:10,961
I certainly will not let you down.

814
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:12,081
Good.

815
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:14,882
It couldn't be better.

816
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:17,682
Since we have been ordered to cooperate,

817
00:36:17,682 --> 00:36:19,121
can you please

818
00:36:19,121 --> 00:36:23,001
show me all the clues and evidence

819
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:24,802
and let me check them?

820
00:36:25,802 --> 00:36:26,762
Sure.
