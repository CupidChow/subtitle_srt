1
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,719
(To suppress the pain of shedding skin,)

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
(I must endure the bitter cold.)

3
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,800
(Humans are the most exquisite beings
in the world.)

4
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,840
(Though the body is destroyed,
there is a remedy that can heal.)

5
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,719
(That is faith.)

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,840
(I will not despair.)

7
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,520
(The colder it is,
the clearer I become.)

8
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,920
(This pain.)

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,439
(I'll never forget it.)

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,392
=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

11
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:06,080
=Episode 2=

12
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,522
(Luo Residence)

13
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,439
Father.

14
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,199
(This is agarwood powder.)

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,280
Why are you here?

16
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,439
Ailian,

17
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
I told the guard
the general wanted to see him

18
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,599
to divert him away.

19
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,240
Here are the servant clothes.

20
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
Change and go to the side gate.

21
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,360
There's a carriage
waiting for you there.

22
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,479
I've been wronged.

23
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,599
Our father's death
is fraught with suspicions.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,120
I won't leave
without uncovering the truth.

25
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,080
Now, Shuangshuang and our mother

26
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,719
are both adamant
that you killed our father.

27
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,439
Prefect Bai is a total incompetent.

28
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,240
If it comes to trial and punishment,

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
I fear you may lose your life.

30
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,560
If I go now,

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,360
it'd be even harder
to find out the truth.

32
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,879
There will come a time.

33
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,479
You must first ensure your own safety.

34
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,800
Only then will you have a chance.

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,120
I will continue
to look for clues at home.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,879
There's no time to hesitate. Go!

37
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,000
Giddy-up.

38
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,800
Giddy-up.

39
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,520
(I have now escaped,)

40
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,719
(but if I cannot clear my name,)

41
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,560
(I'll always be a patricide
in the eyes of the law.)

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,479
(And Xue'er.)

43
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,240
(She let me go.)

44
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,199
(General Xu will surely
hold her accountable.)

45
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,759
(Can she get through this safely?)

46
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,639
Turn back.

47
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,720
Miss,

48
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,240
we've already come this far.

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
Why bother going back?

50
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,279
My father was framed by someone.

51
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,399
I must find the real culprit

52
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,680
as his daughter.

53
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,399
Miss, please take my advice.

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
Everything is destined.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,120
It's all preordained.

56
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,120
Effort can change fate.

57
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,759
I will not give up.

58
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,079
I must find the real culprit.

59
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,800
Stop.

60
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,160
Ho.

61
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,399
What?

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,759
Do you really think no one
has noticed you and your sister?

63
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,000
This is why I put you
in the firewood room

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,199
instead of the prison.

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,439
Just to feel you out.

66
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
Let go of me.

67
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,879
You just said you wanted
to go back and investigate it.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,360
But why would you turn around

69
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,720
and run away when seeing me?

70
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,439
If you were right,

71
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,040
I can pardon your sister's crime
of releasing a suspect.

72
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,480
Back then at the scene,

73
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,480
I was frightened.

74
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,720
Later in the firewood room, I found

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,040
there was
some agarwood powder on my hand.

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,439
Looking back, I thought

77
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,759
it got on me when I was
holding my father's body.

78
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,000
The murderer

79
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,920
must have known
that my father had asthma.

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,759
That's why they used agarwood powder.

81
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,480
Only someone close to my father

82
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,959
would use such a method to kill him.

83
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,319
Do you have a suspect then?

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,639
This kind of agarwood powder
has a neutral scent.

85
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,360
Both men and women can use it.

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,160
I must have smelled it at home.

87
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,360
I just can't think of it right now.

88
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,319
When you did not know
my true identity just now,

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,639
you thought about returning
to investigate it.

90
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,600
For now,

91
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,319
I will believe you.

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,519
I earnestly request a chance

93
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,519
to clear my name
and find out who killed my father.

94
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,279
This was left to me by my mother.

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,800
I treasure it.

96
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,120
I will entrust this jade pendant to you.

97
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,079
If I find out the truth,

98
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,959
I will ask you to return it.

99
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,920
If I cannot prove my innocence,

100
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,720
this jade will shatter

101
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,360
and I'll kill myself.

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,759
Miss, please stand up.

103
00:06:54,304 --> 00:07:02,016
♪Hesitant and struggling, still unable
to break free from the chains of time♪

104
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,439

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,319

Word that there's an important lead.

109

Please hurry back.

110
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,759
I've got military matters.

111
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,480
This is a firework flare.

112
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,399
If there's any emergency situation,

113
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,560
fire it immediately

114

Yes.

Shuangshuang.

125
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,120
She has sneaked back to rest again.

126
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,919
She's a real headache.

127
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,080
Shuangshuang.

128
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,039
Mother, you were looking for me?

129
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,639
What are you doing here?

130
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,519
Go keep watch at the mourning hall.

131
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,320
There are so many people there.

132
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,559
One less person won't matter.

133
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,799
Why must I go there
just to put on an act?

134
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,000
Go now.

135
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,879
This is shoddy.

136
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,519
How dare you give me such clothes?

137
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,000
Miss Shuangshuang,

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,440
the clothes have just been rushed out.

139
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Time was too pressing.

140
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,159
How dare you talk back?

141
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,440
Do you want to be hit?

142
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,120
Get lost!

143
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,080
(See you in the ancestral hall,
from Xu Chengfeng)

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
(Xu Chengfeng?)

145
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,559
(The handsome
and imposing great general!)

146
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,559
General Xu.

147
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,559
General.

148
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,919
General Xu, where are you?

149
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,759
General, come out.

150
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,120
General Xu, stop hiding.

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,759
General Xu.

153
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,960
Why is it you?

154
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,279
We're just in the ancestral hall.

155
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,360
Why are you so frightened?

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,360
Or are you feeling guilty?

157
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,639
Luo Ailian,

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
w-w-why are you here?

159
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,759
What else?

160
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,200
Where do you think I am?

161
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,559
In the prison cell?

162
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,080
Prison is for the one
who killed our father.

163
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,440
That's not me.

164
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,559
Someone! The murderer has escaped!

165
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,360
Come catch her!

166
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,720
What are you going to do?
Don't you dare hurt me!

167
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,600
It's you

168
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,360
who wrote notes in my name

169
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,639
and asked Du Ruoshan out to seduce him.

170
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,159
It's you

171
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,279
who caused the catastrophe
for the Du and Luo families.

172
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,600
No, it's not me!

173
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,399
Yes, it's you.

174
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,159
It's you

175
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,639
who was furious with embarrassment

176
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,519
and used agarwood powder

177
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,519
to kill our father
after being discovered by him.

178
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,519
No!

179
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,039
Luo Ailian, you're mad!

180
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,360
Trying to absolve yourself
by framing me.

181
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,480
Framing you?

182
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,200
Can you swear to our ancestors

183
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,519
that you didn't lie?

184
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,072
(The late great-great-grandfather Luo)

185
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,840
Why should I swear to our ancestors?

186
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,480
It's you who have disgraced
our family, not me.

187
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,759
This is the flare given by General Xu.

188
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,799
Once the murderer is found,

189
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,879
I use this to signal him.

190
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,759
Are you admitting it now

191
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,440
or do it in front of the general?

192
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,039
I...

193
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,600
I have heard

194
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,960
the general is strict

195
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,720
with his troops.

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,679
Those who lie

197
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,360
will be punished with tongue-ripping

198
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,679
which is so painful
and one's face will be ruined.

199
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,000
You'd rather die.

200
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,840
Will you say it?

201
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,919
Yes.

202
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,559
What should I do, Mother?

203
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,759
She mustn't have
the chance to speak again.

204
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,320
You mean...

205
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
She knows too much.

206
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,399
She must die.

207
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,600
Furthermore,

208
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,919
as long as she is alive,

209
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,639
she will always be a hindrance to us.

210
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,440
Keeping her will inevitably
lead to endless troubles.

211
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
But...

212
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,399
No "but".

213
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,879
Mother, she's awakened.

214
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,600
You little wretch

215
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,879
even play tricks under my watch.

216
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,039
It was you

217
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,360
who killed our father.

218
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,960
No, it was you who killed him.

219
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,600
You regretted it
after killing your father

220
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,679
and then you committed suicide.

221
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,919
Shuangshuang.

222
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,360
Hold her down.

223
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,039
Let me go.

224
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,639
How can you be so vicious?

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,960
You killed my father

226
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,200
and now you want to kill me.

227
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,440
Like you're innocent.

228
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,879
It was you who caused Mr. Du's death.

229
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,559
Still playing the good person even now.

230
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,279
Your innocent facade

231
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
truly makes me sick.

232
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,360
Let me go.

233
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,320
Luo Ailian,

234
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,799
aren't you a good daughter?

235
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,480
Then join your father
on the journey to the underworld.

236
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,000
What are you doing?

237
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,519
Uncle.

238
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,559
Have you gone mad?

239
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,440
Mother.

240
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,919
Ailian.

241
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,320
Mother.

242
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,919
Ailian.

243
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,360
She is my departed brother's daughter.

244
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,080
Why must you be so cruel?

245
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,879
Ailian.

246
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,159
Uncle.

247
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,679
The flare.

248
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,440
General Xu.

249
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,600
You can't help her!

250
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,720
Jizhou,

251
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,159
if you do it,

252
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,480
your own daughter will have to die.

253
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,320
What?

254
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,200
My daughter?

255
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,960
I'm your sister-in-law.

256
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,960
But 18 years ago,
you were drunk on a rainy night.

257
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,360
Did you forget it?

258
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,399
Think about Shuangshuang's birthday.

259
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,360
You always say you are a loner.

260
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,320
But your daughter
has always been right before your eyes.

261
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,480
Shuangshuang.

262
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,840
What does it mean?

263
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,639
Am I

264
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,559
the daughter of you and...?

265
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,759
Jizhou,

266
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,919
Luo Jida has already died.

267
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,559
You are the only man left.

268
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,120
From now on, my daughter and I

269
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,320
have to rely on you.

270
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,519
Uncle,

271
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,399
you just made a mistake
while you were drunk.

272
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,480
My father won't blame you.

273
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,919
Don't make another one, Uncle.

274
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,759
Uncle.

275
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,440
Luo Jizhou,

276
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,159
today she has come
to know all of our affairs.

277
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,320
If she speaks out,

278
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,720
what others

279
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,960
must think of you, me and Shuangshuang?

280
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,679
Will we still live?

281
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,159
No, murder is a capital offense.

282
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,399
Besides, Ailian is my own niece.

283
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,480
No matter what, I can't kill her.

284
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,200
Uncle, both of my parents
have passed away.

285
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,360
You are my only kin.

286
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,279
I swear I will never tell others.

287
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,359
Luo Jizhou, think about it!

288
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,839
Are you helping her today

289
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,359
or your own daughter?

290
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Uncle.

291
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,839
Uncle,

292
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,680
my father is watching from heaven.

293
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,599
He is begging you to save me, Uncle.

294
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,599
Shut up, wretch!

295
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,799
If you want me to be your daughter,

296
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,960
if you want to become family with us,

297
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,319
don't believe her nonsense.

298
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,319
Don't.

299
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,200
Uncle.

300
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,920
Uncle.

301
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,464
(The late great-great-grandfather Luo)

302
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,519
Jizhou.

303
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
You mustn't.

304
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,799
Uncle.

305
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Uncle, help me.

306
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,519
Uncle.

307
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,960
Uncle.

308
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,839
Please, no, Uncle!

309
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,680
Mother.

310
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,559
Uncle.

311
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,799
Help me, Uncle.

312
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,720
Uncle.

313
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,559
Ailian,

314
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,240
I've failed you.

315
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,200
I have to.

316
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,000
I have to help Shuangshuang.

317
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,799
Everyone is selfish.

318
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,279
Don't blame me.

319
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,519
Uncle.

320
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
General, please wait.

321
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,240
Please convey this to the elder.

322
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,119
I will surely find the treasure map.

323
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,079
I won't fail him.

324
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,880
Yes.

325
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,359
Half a year ago,

326
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,079
the imperial treasure map escorted
by the Shen Escort Agency

327
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,279
was hijacked by bandits.

328
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,559
Besides knowing
that their leader is a woman,

329
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,680
there are no other clues.

330
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,440
But the female bandit left

331
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,759
no traces.

332
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,920
Was it

333
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,799
an inside job

334
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:16,920
and Shen Zishan spread the false news?

335
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,559
I have known him for many years.

336
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,240
He is upright
and would never disgrace his family.

337
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,279
Moreover, it was a secret task.

338
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,759
The Shen family had no idea.

339
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,359
There's a fire somewhere.

340
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,519
Such big smoke.

341
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,680
It is not small.

342
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,359
- Fire!
- Put out the fire!

343
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,319
Someone!

344
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,279
There's a fire!

345
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,000
You managed to rob

346
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,519
the Longmen Escort Agency.

347
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:49,359
All thanks to the big fire
in Luo's mansion last night.

348
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,640
It attracted all the nearby people
and guards.

349
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,240
Otherwise, it wouldn't be so easy.

350
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:02,799
Mr. Shen.

351
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,599
(Shen Zishan of the Shen Escort Agency)
Are you going

352
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,920
to be robbers instead
of an escort after your sign

353
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,440
of the royal escort agency

354
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,000
was taken away?

355
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,440
Leave the things you snatched here.

356
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,000
Who do you think you are?

357
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,440
I won't spare your life.

358
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,119
You just wait.

359
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,880
Go.

360
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:02,440
Young Master.

361
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,200
Young Master.

362
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,480
I got this back
from the people who robbed

363
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,440
the Longmen Escort Agency.

364
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,079
Their head escort used rare seeds

365
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,119
to cultivate a rare herb
known as the Dragon Grass.

366
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,319
Mr. Miao once said

367
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,359
it might save my sister's life.

368
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,559
Mr. Luo,

369
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,119
exchange this thing
for the Dragon Grass.

370
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,279
Yes, Young Master.

371
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
I will certainly get it for Miss Shen.

372
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,880
Giddy-up.

373
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,440
Young Master,

374
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,400
a person is floating there.

375
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:52,200
Pull that one up.

376
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,759
She seems to be burnt.

377
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,920
She's still breathing.
Bring her back to our medical hut.

378
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,559
Yes.

379
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,680
Can this woman still be saved?

380
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,920
She's still alive with such injuries.

381
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,680
It's amazing.

382
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,880
Young Master.

383
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,480
The Dragon Grass's here.

384
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,039
Thank you. You can leave.

385
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:27,880
Yes.

386
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:29,680
Mr. Miao,

387
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,519
with the Dragon Grass,

388
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,279
my sister can be awakened, right?

389
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,440
Too late.

390
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,839
Danqing has been comatose for too long.

391
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,200
(Shen Danqing of the Shen Escort Agency)
She's at the end of her life.

392
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,000
(Physician Miao)
The Dragon Grass

393
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,359
is of no use now.

394
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,200
Is it

395
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,519
truly hopeless?

396
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,160
That was the case until today.

397
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,599
So there is still a way!

398
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,559
Tell me.

399
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,880
I will do anything for my sister.

400
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,519
If a fresh, young girl's heart
is transplanted to Danqing,

401
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,920
she will be able to wake up.

402
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,000
Otherwise, in at most two days,

403
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,279
she will pass away.

404
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,640
A fresh, young girl's heart.

405
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,400
This woman is not related to you.

406
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,200
And her face is completely ruined.

407
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,240
Even if she is saved,

408
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,720
she may not necessarily survive.

409
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,480
It would be better
to save your sister's life.

410
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,240
Your greatest wish before

411
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
was to cure your sister

412
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,319
and put your father at ease.

413
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,359
Now your wish

414
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,480
will come true.

415
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,480
You want me to kill a stranger

416
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,599
to save Danqing?

417
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:34,880
I'm sorry, Miss Xue'er.

418
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,759
You may leave.

419
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,519
Yes.

420
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,079
Yes.

421
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,599
Ailian.

422
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,440
Danqing!

423
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,680
Danqing.

424
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,839
Your sister is kind.

425
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,799
She didn't want to see you kill people.

426
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,839
Nor did she want others
to die because of her.

427
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,680
So she made the decision for you.

428
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,599
I'm sorry.

429
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,599
Zishan.

430
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,119
Are you still willing to save the woman?

431
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,680
I have a secret skill
called the Miraculous Revival.

432
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,160
I can transfer Danqing's face
onto that woman.

433
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,839
In doing so,

434
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,400
Master Shen will not get sicker
due to your sister's death.

435
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,160
And that woman

436
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,039
won't have to live in anguish
over her disfigured face.

437
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,319
You mean

438
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,119
to have her become
Danqing's replacement?

439
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,559
Anyway,

440
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,440
Danqing's life

441
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,440
could perhaps continue in this way.

442
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,759
If no face transplant is done,

443
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,519
will she die?

444
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,680
Her skin is severely ulcerated

445
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,680
and has been unable to heal.

446
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,960
A skin transplant is the only method.

447
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,359
But

448
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,480
the transplant is extremely painful.

449
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,200
I wonder if she can bear it.

450
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,039
Yes.

451
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,359
Please save me.

452
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,440
I want to live.

Thank you, Miss.

474
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,519
(So it was her.)

475
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,599
Thank you for saving my life.

476
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,119
It's been so long.

477
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
You are finally able to speak.

478
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,559
Now can you tell me

479
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,440
who you really are?

480
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,599
Luo Ailian, the eldest daughter
of the Luo family

481
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:45,920
from the Ganlu Brewery.

482
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,680
The young lady of the Luo family?

483
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,039
My father was murdered,

484
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,839
and I was wrongfully
accused of patricide.

485
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,839
After I discovered the truth,

486
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,799
I got into trouble.

487
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,039
To cover up their doings,

488
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,599
they even attempted to murder me.

489
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,279
Are you saying

490
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,640
that someone tried to kill you
while you were fleeing?

491
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,200
How did you escape
under those circumstances?

492
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,920
It was my loyal servant,

493
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:16,640
Bin'er.

494
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,599
My lady.

495
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,400
My...

496
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,799
My lady, I'll pull you up.

497
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,519
My lady.

498
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,839
Bin'er.

499
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,759
My lady.

500
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,640
I'll pull you up.

501
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,519
Bin'er.

502
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,400
Grab the rope.

503
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,359
My lady.

504
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,640
Hurry.

505
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,240
Bin'er!

506
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,960
Grab my hand.

507
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,400
Let go.

508
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,920
The beam won't hold,
and you'll fall too,

509
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,359
No, Bin'er. We'll go together.

510
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,839
Let's go together.

511
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,960
Grab my hand.

512
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,000
You hold onto me.

513
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,680
Bin'er!

514
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,440
Bin'er!

515
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,319
Bin'er!

516
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,000
(God,)

517
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,519
(if you have to,)

518
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,640
(just take me away.)

519
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,000
(Please spare)

520
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:49,519
(my lady.)

521
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,000
You've just recovered.

522
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,719
You mustn't get too emotional.

523
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,360
Rest.

524
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,079
I'll come again.

525
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,608
(Luo Residence)

526
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,624
(Father Luo Jida)

527
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,880
Madam Luo,

528
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,239
condolences.

529
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,360
Father.

530
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:01,800
Ailian.

531
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,719
Why did you abandon me?

532
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,199
Go cry outside.

533
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,960
Don't put on an act here.

534
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,480
They were our family.

535
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,239
How can you be so cold-hearted?

536
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,679
How dare you lecture me?

537
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,719
Stop quarreling here.

538
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,079
Madam,

539
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
Mr. Du had Du Bin deliver
some funeral supplies

540
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,960
and send his condolence.

541
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,079
He didn't mention
anything about his son.

542
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,440
Hypocritical.

543
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,760
Two people from our family died,

544
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,760
so he is afraid of being suspected.

545
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,519
Is there anything else?

546
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,920
Miss Ailian...

547
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,039
Luo Ailian's body has been sent
to the mass burial mound.

548
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,679
How could it be sent there?

549
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,320
A person who killed her father
mustn't be buried in our family grave.

550
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,519
But...

551
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,400
Mr. Luo,

552
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,719
I have something to discuss with you.

553
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,920
Please come with me.

554
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,199
Shuixian, come help me out.

555
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,840
It hurts so much.

556
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,079
(Mother's knitting.)

557
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,280
(Why was the knitting Shuangshuang made)

558
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,840
(for our mother there?)

559
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,800
(There were bloodstains on it.)

560
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,880
I know you are kind-hearted.

561
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,239
But it is not the time

562
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,679
to be merciful.

563
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,280
If a word leaks out, we'll all be dead.

564
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,119
As long as we stand united,

565
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,239
no one will be able
to unearth our secret.

566
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,599
Let's have the authorities
close the case soon.

567
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,079
They've found no clues,

568
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,960
but will they easily believe our words?

569
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,920
Repeated rumor becomes a fact.

570
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,360
Do you know how those words got out?

571
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,400
It was you.

572
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,119
Luo's daughter was forced into
a ghost marriage and killed him.

573
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,000
Then she set a fire to commit suicide.

574
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,679
The more real the words sound,

575
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,159
the more they can deceive others.

576
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,480
Things have come to this.

577
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,960
Let's just do as you say.

578
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,679
Over this period of time,

579
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,280
you have been resting.

580
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,639
You only know
the very basics of Danqing.

581
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,800
If you truly want to become her,

582
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
changing your face
is only the first step.

583
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,199
The road ahead

584
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:04,800
is still long.

585
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:07,719
This is my notebook.

586
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,440
Inside it contains the past
of Danqing and me

587
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
as well as her preferences
and character.

588
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:14,840
Take it

589
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,599
and have a careful look.

590
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,960
Danqing

591
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,480
had been cheerful, bold
and cute since childhood,

592
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,760
She liked to play in the water
but strangely didn't know how to swim.

593
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,000
She was skilled in ink painting
and could capture

594
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,039
the essence

595
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,360
of any animal with just a few strokes.

596
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,559
She was brave and agile.

597
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,960
She was especially good at
using hidden weapons.

598
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,599
Nowadays, it's being said everywhere

599
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,320
Luo Ailian killed her father.

600
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,960
Since you can't go back

601
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,519
and have put on my sister's face,

602
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,400
from now on,
you are a member of our family.

603
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,159
You must be careful
in all you say and do

604
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,280
and must not implicate our family.

605
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,039
I will fulfill my duties
as Shen Danqing.

606
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,440
I will act prudently.

607
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,599
But since I am alive,

608
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,360
I will surely avenge them.

609
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,880
How can I give up?

610
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,639
It was a narrow escape to you.

611
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,440
Don't bring trouble upon yourself.

612
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,639
You have now changed your appearance.

613
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,679
Forget all of your past.

614
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,239
In the future,

615
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,519
just live as Shen Danqing.

616
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,360
(I will live up to being Shen Danqing.)

617
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,559
(But in the face of my enemies,)

618
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:31,920
