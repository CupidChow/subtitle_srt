00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:18,880
=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,568
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:25,502
I heard that Ying'er went to the winery
with you today.

4
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:28,903
She wanted to see wine-making.

5
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,382
However, I feel

6
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,662
that she has grown somewhat distant
from me since she returned.

7
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:35,422
I hope I'm overthinking it.

8
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,543
You're worried that Ying'er
will be instigated by Luo Xue'er.

9
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:41,862
Ying'er is pure and genuine.

10
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:45,063
She makes me feel like
I have a true confidante.

11
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,743
That's why I don't want her
to get involved in our disputes.

12
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:49,823
Rest assured.

13
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:53,183
Ying'er and my sister have been close
since little. Their friendship is solid.

14
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:54,862
Luo Xue'er won't succeed.

15
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:57,662
Besides, Ying'er is about to leave soon.

16
00:01:57,983 --> 00:01:59,422
Luo Xue'er can't do anything.

17
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:01,743
I hope so.

18
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,303
- You're here.
- Any clues?

19
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,702
I've been looking at the map
of the Southern Dynasty,

20
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:27,623
examining places mentioned
in the poem, like Jiangbei and Xizhou,

21
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,183
and even places famous
for plum and apricot blossoms.

22
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:33,423
But there are still no clues.

23
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,023
So I've been thinking

24
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,102
about whether we've been going
in the wrong direction from the start.

25
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:40,903
Take another look at these lines.

26
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:43,782
Remembering Xizhou,
full of plum blossoms,

27
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:45,102
I sent plum flowers to Jiangbei.

28
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:46,782
A thin robe in apricot red,

29
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:49,343
and hair as black as crow chicks.

30
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,463
Danqing, what do you think
these describe?

31
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:55,822
These two lines
describe a woman's appearance

32
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:57,583
rather than any locations.

33
00:02:57,982 --> 00:03:01,303
It's more like the poet
is longing for his beloved one.

34
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:02,583
Exactly.

35
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,343
So our initial direction
for the investigation was wrong.

36
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:07,863
This is a poem expressing longing.

37
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:09,623
The clues indicated by the verses

38
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:12,702
are not a place but a person.

39
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,382
It is the woman in this painting.

40
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:16,982
I see.

41
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:20,063
Then let's make another trip
to the library

42
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:23,423
to see if there are any clues
about Zhou You's beloved woman.

43
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,942
Stay sharp these days.

44
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:38,183
And be sure to guard strictly,

45
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:39,982
not allowing anyone to approach.

46
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,063
If anyone forces their way in,
report it to me immediately.

47
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:43,822
(Library)

48
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:44,702
Understood.

49
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:47,583
As for the clues
we've been investigating,

50
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,782
how could Prince Yi
know about them in advance?

51
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,143
I've been very cautious this time.
It definitely wasn't me.

52
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:57,343
Danqing was just
sorting out the thoughts

53
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:59,063
to find the solution to the problem

54
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:00,183
to prevent recurrence.

55
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:02,102
We wouldn't doubt you.

56
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,353
(Prince Yi's Mansion)

57
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:16,342
You can let my brother
go home now, right?

58
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:18,863
I always keep my word.

59
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:24,303
Your brother is already at home.

60
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,702
The information you provided
about Shen Zishan is very accurate.

61
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:30,303
Well done.

62
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:31,863
Here.

63
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:34,582
No need.

64
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:46,822
Your Highness, no wonder
you have been confident all along.

65
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:48,423
You've had a plan from the start.

66
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:52,183
Your plan must be about
to come to fruition.

67
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:53,303
Be patient.

68
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:57,022
Soup needs to be simmered
to become thick.

69
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:58,783
And aged wine is the most fragrant.

70
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:01,382
People and matters all need
to be thoroughly pondered.

71
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:03,303
Only then can one be foolproof.

72
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:08,223
Now only the final step remains.

73
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:11,462
Where Zishan?

74
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:15,022
I haven't seen him since I got back.

75
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:16,142
He must have gone out.

76
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:19,902
Danqing, I've pondered for a long time.

77
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:22,702
But I can't figure out
where the leak came from.

78
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:25,262
I share the same thoughts as you.

79
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:28,902
Are you suspecting...?

80
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:34,663
But I don't believe that Zishan
intentionally revealed any clues.

81
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,582
But he's already been targeted
by Prince Yi.

82
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,863
With Prince Yi's methods
of indirect probing,

83
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:41,423
he might have found
some useful information.

84
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,423
In the end, he will surely

85
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:45,942
use the revitalization
of the Shen family to bewitch Zishan.

86
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,262
We don't have much time left.

87
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:50,902
Indeed, there is no room for error.

88
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:53,663
Since we have learned this lesson,

89
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:57,022
we can't put ourselves
in such a passive position anymore.

90
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:59,382
So you mean...

91
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:02,063
To avoid any leaks,

92
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:05,183
we won't inform Zishan
about future actions anymore.

93
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:08,303
This is a temporary expedient.

94
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,262
We must prevent trouble
before it happens.

95
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:33,142
(From the moment Xu Chengfeng
received the secret edict,)

96
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,022
regardless of your explanation,

97
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:39,502
Xu Chengfeng and Shen Danqing
will both regard you as an outsider.

98
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:00,382
Why so melancholy?

99
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:04,223
Why must you leave
just as soon as I've arrived?

100
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,822
Let me have a couple of drinks with you.

101
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:10,863
With my humble status,
I don't deserve to drink with you.

102
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:13,822
It's precisely because
you willingly remain humble

103
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:15,942
that Xu Chengfeng outshines you.

104
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:23,863
The young master of the escort agency
is a renowned figure after all.

105
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:25,863
Being overcautious and indecisive
won't do.

106
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:27,942
I have always been straightforward.

107
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,863
Anything I like, I must have.

108
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:34,303
Since you like Shen Danqing,

109
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,382
why don't you dare fight for her?

110
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,783
Do I have to seize by force like you?

111
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:49,342
What's wrong with seizing by force?

112
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:57,983
Actually, it's not hard to guess
what's on a woman's mind.

113
00:07:58,303 --> 00:07:59,783
A woman like Shen Danqing

114
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,223
definitely prefers a man
who is stronger than her,

115
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:06,063
not someone who obviously likes her
but doesn't even dare to compete for her

116
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,303
but instead hides here,
drowning his sorrows in drink.

117
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:10,103
Your Highness,

118
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:12,382
is there some misunderstanding?

119
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,983
I have seen plenty
of long, sentimental affairs.

120
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:22,223
I can see through you at a glance.

121
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:27,623
Last time, even the glory
of the Shen family did not persuade you.

122
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:30,223
Yet you rejected me
because of Shen Danqing.

123
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:31,223
It's obvious

124
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:34,183
that your affection for her
is deep and sincere.

125
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:37,702
Then let me be honest with you.

126
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:39,622
As long as you are willing to help me,

127
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:41,582
you can not only
regain the royal plaque,

128
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:44,663
but you can also win Shen Danqing.

129
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:48,303
What are you talking about?

130
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:50,702
I don't understand a single word.

131
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,183
If you really do not understand,

132
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:55,063
then you are a complete fool.

133
00:08:57,143 --> 00:09:00,183
Xu Chengfeng has come to Liao City
to investigate the treasure map case.

134
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:01,942
You've been serving him hand and foot,

135
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:04,423
and in the end,
all the credit still goes to him.

136
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:06,183
And you?

137
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:08,742
He is already the commanding general.

138
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:11,982
If he renders another merit,
he will climb even higher.

139
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:13,702
And what will you gain?

140
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:17,383
Even if His Majesty restores
the royal title of your escort agency,

141
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:20,423
you are still just
a mere martial artist.

142
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:22,663
What do you have to compare with him?

143
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:25,303
I have no desire to compare myself
with anyone.

144
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,023
I only wish to have a clear conscience.

145
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:32,423
Does having a clear conscience mean
that Shen Danqing will fall for you?

146
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:33,742
You really are a blockhead.

147
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:36,183
Listen to me.

148
00:09:36,423 --> 00:09:38,102
As long as Xu Chengfeng is still around,

149
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:41,383
Shen Danqing will not see any other man.

150
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:47,063
Once Xu Chengfeng is gone,

151
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:50,143
all problems will be readily solved.

152
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:54,303
With time, Shen Danqing will come to you

153
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:56,543
and never leave you again.

154
00:09:58,143 --> 00:09:59,742
If Xu Chengfeng were to die,

155
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:02,102
Danqing would never forgive me.

156
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:03,783
You have misunderstood me.

157
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:07,303
Xu Chengfeng will not die.

158
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:14,942
I will petition His Majesty to have him
return to the capital for investigation.

159
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:17,263
At most, he will be dismissed,
sent back to his hometown,

160
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,742
and demoted to a commoner.

161
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,063
There won't be any concern for his life.

162
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:22,263
In this way,

163
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,342
you would lose a rival in love,

164
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,183
and I would lose my nemesis.

165
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:29,263
Wouldn't that be the perfect solution
for both of us?

166
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:36,822
Your family's glory and Shen Danqing
are now at a single thought of yours.

167
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:39,342
Do you want them or not?

168
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:55,622
If you can ensure
Xu Chengfeng doesn't die

169
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,822
and restore the glory of my family,

170
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,383
I could cooperate with you.

171
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:07,622
Good, that's more like it.

172
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:10,222
Follow your desires

173
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:12,423
and take the initiative to seize
what you desire.

174
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:15,503
This is what a true man does.

175
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:34,342
Dinner is served.

176
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:35,903
(Library)
I've got two jars of good wine today.

177
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,102
Come with me to get them.

178
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:37,982
- Yes.
- Yes.

179
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:53,423
Indeed, as you expected,

180
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:55,383
they've slipped into the library.

181
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:58,503
Instead of tightening security
against Xu Chengfeng sneaking in,

182
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:00,503
it would be better to give him a flaw

183
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:02,183
and let him go in
and investigate on his own.

184
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:03,783
When they find the developing water,

185
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,063
we can reap the benefits.

186
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:10,702
But they no longer trust you
as they did before.

187
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,462
How can you ensure it's foolproof?

188
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:16,702
After all, I am still Danqing's brother.

189
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,862
There is still trust between us.

190
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,462
Very well, then I am reassured.

191
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,222
I can assure you

192
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:29,742
that no matter what they find,
I can keep you informed.

193
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,543
But I hope
you will also keep your promise.

194
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:36,023
Rest assured, I always keep my word.

195
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:39,982
Young Master Shen, cooperating with me

196
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:43,222
will be the best decision
you make in your life.

197
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,503
I've seen a booklet here before.

198
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:04,063
Southern Dynasty Anecdotes.

199
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:05,862
It has very comprehensive records.

200
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:07,423
It may contain what we are looking for.

201
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,342
I do have an impression of it.

202
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,102
I've seen it before while reading
the Southern Dynasty Tactics.

203
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:13,102
Let's find it.

204
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:13,822
Okay.

205
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:34,342
Found it.

206
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:38,023
Good.

207
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,063
Zhou You?

208
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:47,543
Zhou You of the Southern Dynasty
sought to marry his cousin.

209
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:49,663
But his mother disapproved of her
making a living

210
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,783
by brewing wine.

211
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,183
She made them break up.

212
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:53,543
Brewing wine?

213
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:56,222
So, this cousin is a brewmaster?

214
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:58,982
The Brewmasters Catalogue
compiled by our dynasty

215
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:01,102
records the renowned brewmasters
from various countries.

216
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,303
And female brewmasters are few.

217
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,543
So the one about the same age
as Zhou You

218
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:08,023
would be that cousin.

219
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:23,982
There are three female brewmasters
in the Southern Dynasty.

220
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:26,742
Two of them are not the same age
as Zhou You.

221
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:30,102
Only Miss Fang is the most likely one.

222
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:35,263
But what does Miss Fang have to do
with developing water?

223
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:36,663
She excelled at brewing wine.

224
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:39,023
And her specialty is Plum Wine.

225
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:41,982
So this developing water
could possibly be a type of wine.

226
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:45,023
But, speaking of which,
times have changed.

227
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,783
Might this Plum Wine
have been lost to time?

228
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:49,862
A thousand-year-old plum tree?

229
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:53,303
I heard about a female brewmaster
when I was young.

230
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:56,622
It's said she was looking for
such a plum tree to hide her wine.

231
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,423
So all we need to do
is find that plum tree,

232
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,342
and we'll find the Plum Wine.

233
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:03,503
Speaking of plum trees,

234
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:06,903
Li City, near Liao City,
is known as the home of plum trees.

235
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:09,503
There is a thousand-year-old plum tree
at the border.

236
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,222
It's an important strategic marker.

237
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:14,622
Li City is twenty miles from here.

238
00:15:15,102 --> 00:15:16,702
Then we have time to go there now.

239
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,102
Let's go.

240
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:26,462
This time, the cargo is very important.

241
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:27,622
When everything is ready,

242
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,303
load up and get ready to set off.

243
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:30,503
Yes.

244
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:33,342
Zishan.

245
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:34,143
You're back.

246
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:39,982
Zishan, we found the developing water.

247
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:41,063
It's the Plum Wine.

248
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:42,263
It's well preserved.

249
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:43,582
That's great.

250
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:44,702
What do we do next?

251
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:46,582
Are there any carts
that haven't left today?

252
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:48,663
They're still loading the cargo
for the neighboring county.

253
00:15:48,742 --> 00:15:49,903
The carts haven't left yet.

254
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:53,423
This is Plum Wine.

255
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:56,423
Put this wine among the usual cargo.

256
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,143
Then escort them
to the neighboring county as usual.

257
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:00,222
Then detour to the capital

258
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:02,023
and hand over the wine to the minister.

259
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:03,982
I will feign escorting it to the capital

260
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:05,462
with Tianhao in separate directions

261
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:07,942
to use it as a smokescreen
to attract the attention of Prince Yi.

262
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:09,063
No problem.

263
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:11,903
We're counting on you for the next.

264
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:17,303
Young Master! Miss!

265
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:18,783
The carts are ready.

266
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:19,982
When shall we depart?

267
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:21,303
Let's depart now.

268
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:22,462
Take this with you.

269
00:16:24,023 --> 00:16:24,822
Yes.

270
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:37,023
Your Highness,
this is the developing water.

271
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:38,462
You may leave.

272
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:39,462
Okay.

273
00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:57,903
So this is the developing water.

274
00:16:58,582 --> 00:16:59,702
I have done what you asked for.

275
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,222
I hope you will also keep your promise.

276
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:03,582
Be patient.

277
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:05,783
After I have verified its authenticity,

278
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:08,182
I will surely not fail to reward you.

279
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:13,223
You know that Mr. Luo
has been bought by me.

280
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,622
So you used him to deliver
the developing water to me

281
00:17:15,822 --> 00:17:17,703
to stage a play for Shen Danqing to see

282
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:19,223
without revealing anything.

283
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:20,342
That's a smart move.

284
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:24,142
Wait until I help your family
regain glory in the future.

285
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,822
And then Shen Danqing
can have a wealthy life with you.

286
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:31,102
You need not fear that she
will not rely on you in the future.

287
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:34,703
Thank you, Your Highness.

288
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:39,743
After this matter, Xu Chengfeng
will be transferred back to the capital

289
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:41,342
to face charges.

290
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:43,783
As long as you continue
to serve me loyally,

291
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:45,303
I assure you

292
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:49,342
that, from now on, no one will dare
to vie with you for Shen Danqing.

293
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:50,943
After receiving your guidance,

294
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:52,862
I have completely understood.

295
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:55,023
I will definitely not
fail your expectations.

296
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:56,983
Then I shall take my leave first.

297
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:57,943
Okay.

298
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:08,703
Your Highness.

299
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:10,422
How is it?

300
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:12,182
The scout has reported

301
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:14,743
that Xu Chengfeng and Tianhao
left the city at midnight,

302
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:16,182
each with a horse
and carrying a package,

303
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:18,102
and went in the direction
of the capital separately.

304
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,703
I have sent people to track separately

305
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:21,303
to 'cooperate' with them in this show.

306
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,223
I have the developing water now.

307
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:25,023
And Xu Chengfeng has left.

308
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:26,622
Now is the time.

309
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:29,142
Zong Wei, there's no time to delay.

310
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,902
Set out immediately
to retrieve the treasure map

311
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:32,662
to test this developing water.

312
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:37,463
Remember,
do not make any mistakes along the way.

313
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,102
Congratulations, Your Highness,
on completing your great cause.

314
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,303
I will take the lead

315
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,983
and never fail your trust.

316
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:45,063
Good.

317
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:34,943
Xu Chengfeng?

318
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,023
Haven't you already left Liao City?

319
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:39,263
How come you are here?

320
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:40,463
If I hadn't 'left',

321
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:43,582
how would your master trust you
to come for the treasure map?

322
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:46,182
So it was a trap you set.

323
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:48,862
Zong Wei, you cannot escape.

324
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:50,622
Surrender yourself.

325
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,783
So you are in cahoots with Xu Chengfeng.

326
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,662
It is too late for you to find out now.

327
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:13,703
You double-dealing traitor!

328
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:15,983
Betraying friends
is called being a traitor.

329
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:18,422
Betraying an enemy is called strategy.

330
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,063
(So you mean...)

331
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:26,023
(To avoid any leaks,)

332
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:28,862
(we won't inform Zishan
about future actions anymore.)

333
00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:35,902
What are you doing?

334
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:37,783
You are being watched.

335
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:41,382
I know that Prince Yi has long
had me under tight surveillance.

336
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:44,063
So that's why you guard against me.

337
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:46,822
Is it because you fear that Prince Yi
will trace back to you through me

338
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:48,582
and find out about your plans?

339
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:49,902
No.

340
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:52,303
I want him to know our actions.

341
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:54,862
And it must be through you.

342
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,503
You're planning
to use his own scheme against him?

343
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,862
Exactly.

344
00:21:01,582 --> 00:21:04,263
Prince Yi used the brother of Mr. Luo
to coerce him

345
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:05,822
and make him betray you

346
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:07,142
to drive a wedge between us

347
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:08,902
to force you to cooperate with him.

348
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:11,983
Then let's just do as he wishes.

349
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,703
Prince Yi stoops
to such unscrupulous means.

350
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:18,422
But he underestimates me too much.

351
00:21:19,142 --> 00:21:20,822
Even if you keep suspecting me,

352
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:23,102
I will never do anything to betray you.

353
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,463
But what should we do now?

354
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:30,703
We must perform the play together.

355
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:35,743
Zishan, you must pretend
to surrender to Prince Yi

356
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:39,182
and make him believe that we've
become enemies when vying for Danqing,

357
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:40,983
thus causing him to lower his guard

358
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:43,342
and luring him
to reveal the treasure map.

359
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,503
No problem.

360
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:48,063
However,
Prince Yi is naturally suspicious.

361
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:49,943
Once he detects any mistakes,

362
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:51,743
we may not get the treasure map

363
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:53,463
and even put your life in danger.

364
00:21:56,943 --> 00:21:58,783
Zishan, have you thought this through?

365
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:00,943
Are you truly willing to do this

366
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:02,382
and help me out?

367
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:04,463
I am not helping you.

368
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:06,902
This is something I should do.

369
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:09,382
Alright.

370
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:12,382
I will write to the minister
to make arrangements,

371
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:14,342
asking for the assistance
of the Royal Guards.

372
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:17,182
I will try my best
to ensure your safety.

373
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:21,582
This time,
we must bring Prince Yi to justice.

374
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:22,822
Okay.

375
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,983
So you conspired together
to set up a trap for His Highness.

376
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:28,862
It's simply despicable and shameless.

377
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,902
The shameless ones are you.

378
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,543
We are only treating you
the way you've treated us.

379
00:22:33,862 --> 00:22:34,783
Surrender now, Zong Wei.

380
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:37,182
Like I said, you can't escape.

381
00:22:37,382 --> 00:22:39,263
I know you've always been
very loyal to him.

382
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:42,463
But persisting stubbornly like this
is pointless.

383
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:43,943
Hand over the map.

384
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:45,543
You aren't the mastermind.

385
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:46,902
It's not too late to turn back now.

386
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:50,342
The prince you are longing for
won't come to protect you.

387
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:51,543
Don't defame His Highness.

388
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:53,463
None of you come closer.

389
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:55,983
This is a specially made,
double-layered cylinder.

390
00:22:56,582 --> 00:22:57,582
The inner container

391
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:58,743
will break if shaken.

392
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:01,783
and the vitriol oil inside
will destroy the treasure map within.

393
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:03,503
If you take one step closer,

394
00:23:04,023 --> 00:23:05,783
I will destroy it and perish with it.

395
00:23:05,783 --> 00:23:07,382
Even if you destroy this treasure map

396
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:11,582
and take all the responsibility
upon yourself,

397
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,622
do you think Prince Yi could come
to save you and help you escape?

398
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,463
I advise you to recognize the situation

399
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:19,463
and not to remain obstinately misguided.

400
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:23,662
You are a double-dealing traitor
and are not qualified to lecture me.

401
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,263
A despicable traitor
is unworthy of being human.

402
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:28,822
Zong Wei, put the map down first.

403
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:30,102
None of you come closer.

404
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:40,862
Zishan, stabilize him first.

405
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:43,142
I'll have the royal guard captain
take the imperial token

406
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:44,822
and bring Prince Yi here.

407
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:47,943
At this point, Prince Yi will surely
prioritize his own safety.

408
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:50,902
We should let Zong Wei
see his ugly true face.

409
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,703
Only then can he surrender to us

410
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:54,182
and hand over the treasure map to us.

411
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:55,463
I guess that will do,

412
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:57,422
so Prince Yi won't get wind of this
and escape again.

413
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:02,503
Zong Wei, you have half an hour
to hand over the treasure map to us

414
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:04,182
and get penalized leniently.

415
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:06,662
Don't even think
about running away with the map.

416
00:24:06,983 --> 00:24:08,223
This place is heavily guarded.

417
00:24:08,503 --> 00:24:09,983
You can't escape even if you have wings.

418
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:14,779
(Prince Yi's Mansion)

419
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:38,422
We're the Royal Guards.
Greetings, Your Highness.

420
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:40,582
Who allowed you to stop?

421
00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:42,023
Continue playing.

422
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:52,102
Do you know the consequences
of disturbing my leisure?

423
00:24:52,422 --> 00:24:53,983
Please follow me, Your Highness.

424
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:57,422
What do the Royal Guards want with me?

425
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:58,182
Your Highness,

426
00:24:58,342 --> 00:25:01,303
your personal guard, Zong Wei,
was caught by us

427
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:02,463
stealing the treasure map.

428
00:25:06,503 --> 00:25:08,023
I dispatched Zong Wei
to a different place.

429
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:09,743
He couldn't possibly be
in Liao City today.

430
00:25:10,582 --> 00:25:12,303
You must have caught the wrong person.

431
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:13,983
We have the same concern.

432
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:16,303
That's why
we invite Your Highness to confirm.

433
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:18,382
If it's a misunderstanding,
it needs to be clarified soon

434
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:19,622
so as not to implicate you.

435
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:21,382
Can't you see I am busy?

436
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:26,303
I'm not in the mood
to play detective games with you.

437
00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:31,342
(Token)
You should recognize this token.

438
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:39,943
(It seems I've fallen
for Xu Chengfeng's scheme.)

439
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:42,743
Your Highness,

440
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:44,063
please.

441
00:25:54,743 --> 00:25:56,223
Greetings, Your Highness.

442
00:26:00,983 --> 00:26:01,743
What's wrong?

443
00:26:02,223 --> 00:26:04,063
Did you not expect me to appear here?

444
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:07,503
Shen Zishan,

445
00:26:08,382 --> 00:26:11,582
sooner or later, I will let you know
the meaning of regret.

446
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:15,422
I'm standing right before you,
Your Highness.

447
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:17,023
If you wish to enlighten me,

448
00:26:17,622 --> 00:26:18,822
there's no need to wait for later.

449
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:19,743
Your Highness,

450
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:23,662
Zong Wei was caught red-handed
stealing the treasure map.

451
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:25,142
He is in the room right now.

452
00:26:26,102 --> 00:26:28,422
A single guard had such audacity

453
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,703
and the capability
to steal the treasure map.

454
00:26:31,263 --> 00:26:33,983
To say there isn't a mastermind
behind all of this

455
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,543
is indeed beyond one's imagination.

456
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:41,142
Moreover, he even deceived
an astute, capable person like you.

457
00:26:42,543 --> 00:26:45,622
I don't know what you are talking about.

458
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:47,743
How could you not?

459
00:26:48,622 --> 00:26:50,382
Ever since His Majesty
issued the decree,

460
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:54,182
you should have known everything.

461
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:58,662
Or perhaps I should phrase it
in a more precise way.

462
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:03,342
This series of framing
and shifting blame is your doing.

463
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:05,382
Xu Chengfeng,
be careful with your words.

464
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:08,503
Framing a royal member
is a crime deserving of death.

465
00:27:08,703 --> 00:27:09,783
Framing?

466
00:27:11,303 --> 00:27:14,862
Since you requested an imperial edict
to assist in solving the case,

467
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,622
you've been covering yourself up.

468
00:27:17,543 --> 00:27:20,263
Given how things stand,
let's have an open and honest talk.

469
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:29,622
To cover up the evidence of your crime,

470
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:32,303
you ordered Zong Wei
to kill Know-it-all.

471
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:35,822
We obtained the sleeve crossbow
used as the murder weapon.

472
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:38,102
Yet, Zong Wei injured Zishan
with a hidden weapon

473
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:41,422
and seized the evidence
by threatening us with the antidote.

474
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,422
Last time, you escaped by sheer luck.

475
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,503
But this time, you and Zong Wei
are like prey trapped by a net.

476
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:49,422
It's impossible for you
to turn the tables now.

477
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:52,743
If you confess and voluntarily hand over
the treasure map,

478
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:55,182
I will ask His Majesty for leniency.

479
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:57,983
But if you persist in your obstinacy
and keep denying,

480
00:27:58,422 --> 00:27:59,862
I'll have no choice but to be impartial.

481
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,463
I will escort you to the capital
and take you to the Supreme Court

482
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:06,182
so that we can clarify everything
in court.

483
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,303
Stop trying to intimidate me
with the Supreme Court.

484
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:22,263
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

485
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:25,063
And I have never seen the treasure map.

486
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:29,223
As for the 'caught red-handed'
that you keep mentioning,

487
00:28:29,382 --> 00:28:31,783
the one you caught is Zong Wei.

488
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:34,263
What does that have to do with me?

489
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:36,503
Zong Wei has been
risking his life for you.

490
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:38,862
He's the one who does
all the dirty and tiring work.

491
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,703
Surely you're not so shameless,

492
00:28:41,063 --> 00:28:43,023
sacrificing a loyal servant
when things go south, are you?

493
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:46,263
I will say it again.

494
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:49,783
Whatever Zong Wei has done
is his own doing.

495
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:51,463
It has nothing to do with me.

496
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:57,543
As for my character,
is it your place to criticize?

497
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:00,342
Very well.

498
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:02,943
It's just what we would expect
from you to say.

499
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:07,023
Then let's hear what Zong Wei
has to say about it.

500
00:29:08,902 --> 00:29:11,662
Please confront Zong Wei face-to-face.

501
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:15,223
You think I don't dare?

502
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:23,703
Impudent servant!

503
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:25,182
How dare you deceive everyone

504
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,983
and commit such a grave crime
behind my back?

505
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:29,703
You've implicated my reputation!

506
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:31,463
Come out and kneel now!

507
00:30:00,662 --> 00:30:04,582
Quickly hand over the treasure map.

508
00:30:16,303 --> 00:30:17,862
In front of General Xu,

509
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:19,902
quickly tell everyone

510
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:24,023
that stealing the treasure map
was your own doing.

511
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:28,543
Zong Wei,

512
00:30:29,382 --> 00:30:31,543
I know you can't rest easy
concerning your foster father.

513
00:30:32,342 --> 00:30:34,543
Considering your many years
of service to me,

514
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:38,182
I will ensure your foster father
is cared for in his old age.

515
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,102
This is coercion and threatening.

516
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:41,263
Zong Wei,

517
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:43,662
you can speak out
about any concerns you have.

518
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:45,983
I assure you
that I will take care of them for you.

519
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:48,662
You need not submit to his threats.

520
00:30:49,503 --> 00:30:50,263
Zong Wei,

521
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:53,102
your loyalty should be given
to the right person.

522
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:54,543
Otherwise, it is misplaced.

523
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:56,263
This is of great importance.

524
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,503
Don't be deceived again.

525
00:30:58,822 --> 00:30:59,783
In my view,

526
00:30:59,783 --> 00:31:03,503
it is you who are now coercing
with threats and bribes.

527
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:05,622
Zong Wei,

528
00:31:05,983 --> 00:31:08,223
you know my patience
has always been limited.

529
00:31:08,422 --> 00:31:11,342
Tell the truth
about what exactly happened now.

530
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:18,983
I will bear the full responsibility.

531
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:22,102
Stealing the treasure map
was done by me alone.

532
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:24,422
What reason would you, as a guard,
have to steal a treasure map?

533
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:25,223
I'm a guard. So what?

534
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,142
I also want to make a name
for myself and be wealthy.

535
00:31:28,142 --> 00:31:29,182
Is there a problem with that?

536
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:31,582
I lost my parents when I was young.

537
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:32,943
My foster father raised me.

538
00:31:33,382 --> 00:31:34,503
Now he is gravely ill,

539
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:35,783
yet I have no money to treat him.

540
00:31:36,223 --> 00:31:39,142
That's why I took the risk
behind my master's back.

541
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:43,142
General Xu,

542
00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:45,783
Zong Wei has already made it very clear

543
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:48,223
that this matter
has nothing to do with me.

544
00:31:48,943 --> 00:31:52,463
Do you still insist on taking me
to the Supreme Court

545
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,943
to argue the case before His Majesty?

546
00:31:58,223 --> 00:31:58,902
Tianhao,

547
00:31:59,662 --> 00:32:03,622
escort Zong Wei to the firewood room
together with the royal guard captain

548
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:04,902
and guard strictly.

549
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:06,902
Yes.

550
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:28,783
Can I leave now?

551
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:29,662
Hold on.

552
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:33,543
You've fantasized about monopolizing
the treasure to grow your power.

553
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:36,102
It would be a mere dream.

554
00:32:36,303 --> 00:32:37,822
With me here,
you will never get your wish.

555
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:39,503
With this deadlock,

556
00:32:39,862 --> 00:32:40,943
you should surrender soon.

557
00:32:41,582 --> 00:32:44,303
Given your royal lineage,

558
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:45,902
His Majesty will spare your life.

559
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:47,822
And Zong Wei is merely an accessory.

560
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:49,662
He will be dealt with leniently.

561
00:32:50,422 --> 00:32:51,983
I will say it one last time.

562
00:32:52,943 --> 00:32:56,102
All of this was Zong Wei's doing alone

563
00:32:56,822 --> 00:32:58,142
and has nothing to do with me.

564
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,783
(I have one more favor to ask.)

565
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:14,463
I wish you could grant it.

566
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:15,582
There is no one else here.

567
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:17,303
What are you doing? Get up to speak.

568
00:33:17,382 --> 00:33:17,902
Your Highness,

569
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:19,822
I implore you to promise me

570
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:22,543
that if any mishap should occur

571
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:24,342
in the future,

572
00:33:25,023 --> 00:33:26,142
you won't protect me.

573
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:28,023
What do you mean?

574
00:33:32,422 --> 00:33:33,142
What is this?

575
00:33:33,582 --> 00:33:35,783
A pendant with poison hidden inside.

576
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:37,622
If anything happens,

577
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:39,342
you need not have any concerns.

578
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:40,023
No.

579
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:43,063
No matter how many people die for me,

580
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,503
you can't.

581
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:49,142
If my life can save yours,

582
00:33:49,743 --> 00:33:51,983
it would be my greatest honor.

583
00:33:59,182 --> 00:33:59,983
Your Highness,

584
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:04,902
I will continue
to serve you in the next life.

585
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:09,063
Take care, Your Highness!

586
00:34:10,742 --> 00:34:11,503
No.

587
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:44,903
It's poison.

588
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,262
You should at least
take one last look at him.

589
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:03,343
After all, he died for you.

590
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:10,983
Since the matter has been settled,

591
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:13,343
I have no reason to stay longer.

592
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,503
I think you will always remember today.

593
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:19,943
You killed your most loyal companion
with your own hand.

594
00:35:47,823 --> 00:35:49,903
(My parents were once outcasts
from their respective sects.)

595
00:35:50,622 --> 00:35:52,343
When I was young, my family
was retaliated against.

596
00:35:52,742 --> 00:35:54,383
And in the end,
my entire family was destroyed,

597
00:35:55,102 --> 00:35:56,943
leaving only me
to wander the streets alone.

598
00:35:57,662 --> 00:35:59,782
It was you who saved me
and brought me back.

599
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:01,102
You fed me, sheltered me,

600
00:36:01,222 --> 00:36:02,463
taught me martial arts,

601
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:04,742
let me learn to read,

602
00:36:05,302 --> 00:36:06,662
and taught me etiquette.

603
00:36:07,742 --> 00:36:08,543
Your Highness,

604
00:36:09,622 --> 00:36:11,383
I owe you my life.

605
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:13,702
You can take it away at any time.

606
00:36:15,662 --> 00:36:19,102
I only regret not being able
to serve you any longer.

607
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:41,742
(Xu Chengfeng and Shen Zishan,)

608
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,742
(let's wait and see.)

609
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,023
This is the developing water we found.

610
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,503
I hope you can hand over it
and the treasure map

611
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:01,943
to the minister.

612
00:37:03,302 --> 00:37:04,662
- Take this.
- There is one more thing.

613
00:37:04,943 --> 00:37:06,782
You also need to tell the minister

614
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:09,702
that if this Plum Wine
is used as the developing water,

615
00:37:10,182 --> 00:37:12,622
it is only effective
for half a month once opened.

616
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:16,063
If it exceeds this time limit,
it cannot be used anymore.

617
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:17,343
Please keep that in mind.

618
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:18,622
Rest assured, General Xu.

619
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:20,023
I'll rush back to the capital shortly

620
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:21,423
and report to the minister

621
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:23,742
and His Majesty
that you've found the treasure map.

622
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:25,222
As for the body of Zong Wei,

623
00:37:25,463 --> 00:37:26,702
- we will see to his burial.
- Okay.

624
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:28,543
I will also write to the minister

625
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:31,863
to clarify everything
about this operation

626
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:33,582
and give an explanation to His Majesty.

627
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:36,742
Unfortunately, we lack direct evidence
of Prince Yi's involvement.

628
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:38,903
And now Zong Wei has died.

629
00:37:39,262 --> 00:37:41,102
We can only temporarily
release Prince Yi.

630
00:37:42,102 --> 00:37:43,823
General Xu,
I will return to the capital to report.

631
00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:45,983
Let's go.

632
00:37:49,823 --> 00:37:52,182
Prince Yi has once again
escaped by luck.

633
00:37:52,662 --> 00:37:53,262
Indeed.

634
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:56,102
However, Prince Yi has for a long time

635
00:37:56,102 --> 00:37:58,463
considered such luck to be the norm.

636
00:37:59,222 --> 00:38:00,383
Now that Zong Wei has died,

637
00:38:01,702 --> 00:38:02,983
from now on, Prince Yi will no longer

638
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:06,262
have such loyal and willing pawns
by his side to sacrifice for him.

639
00:38:06,463 --> 00:38:08,142
He won't go far.

640
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:13,302
Zishan, we just need to be patient
and plan for the long run.

641
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:15,903
We will surely bring him to justice.

642
00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:35,662
What are you looking at so intently?

643
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:37,503
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

644
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:41,102
It's so serene and peaceful,

645
00:38:43,063 --> 00:38:47,262
as if all the joys and sorrows
of this world never happened.

646
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:50,102
Actually, the moon has never changed.

647
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:52,383
It's our state of mind that has changed.

648
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:55,662
We have found the treasure map.

649
00:38:55,662 --> 00:38:57,903
After dealing with Luo Xue'er's affairs,

650
00:38:58,222 --> 00:39:00,383
we can then be together
without being disturbed.

651
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:02,903
When that time comes,

652
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:04,582
I will accompany you to see

653
00:39:04,983 --> 00:39:05,943
the waters, mountains,

654
00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:08,102
and brilliant galaxy.

655
00:39:11,702 --> 00:39:12,742
Actually,

656
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:15,423
all along this path,

657
00:39:17,782 --> 00:39:19,102
I've been particularly grateful to you.

658
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:22,343
When I was still Luo Ailian,

659
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:25,782
you didn't believe
that I killed our father.

660
00:39:26,702 --> 00:39:27,782
You let me go to investigate,

661
00:39:29,262 --> 00:39:30,863
which gave me immense comfort.

662
00:39:31,782 --> 00:39:33,343
Later, when we met again,

663
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:36,943
although I couldn't fully
reveal my identity,

664
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:43,463
you still said
you believed in Luo Ailian.

665
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:53,343
I've been walking through thorns
all the way.

666
00:39:56,142 --> 00:39:58,903
And you're like a beam of light
in my life.

667
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:02,262
Even if I've experienced misfortune,

668
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:09,863
I still believe in the goodness
of this world.

669
00:40:19,423 --> 00:40:20,383
Danqing,

670
00:40:21,063 --> 00:40:23,622
perhaps this is what fate has destined.

671
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,182
In my eyes, you are like
the bright moon and stars.

672
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,662
You are the most beautiful existence
in this world.

673
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,102
Your wisdom, independence, courage,

674
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:36,662
and defying of fate

675
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,423
all deeply attract me.

676
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:40,782
So whether you are Luo Ailian

677
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:43,222
or Shen Danqing,

678
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:46,182
to me, you're someone I need to protect.

679
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:50,543
And of course,

680
00:40:51,063 --> 00:40:54,262
except for that female bandit
who sprinkled scented powder on my face.

681
00:40:56,943 --> 00:40:59,903
So you knew all along
that the person back then was me.

682
00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:00,702
Of course.

683
00:41:01,142 --> 00:41:03,622
I've always been observant
of the finest detail.

684
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:06,943
Then why didn't you catch me
at that time?

685
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:11,863
Could it be that you had fallen for me
at first sight?

686
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:15,662
At that time,
I felt you were very special

687
00:41:16,102 --> 00:41:16,983
and not at all simple.

688
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:19,222
So I thought to spare you for a while

689
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:21,423
to see if you could come up
with any new tricks.

690
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:26,662
What about you?
When did you become fond of me?

691
00:41:29,102 --> 00:41:30,302
That's a secret.

692
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:32,662
If you want to know...

693
00:41:40,182 --> 00:41:44,702
Actually, I don't know either.

694
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,142
But suddenly, one day,

695
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:49,063
I found

696
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:54,823
that there was no one else
in my eyes but you.

697
00:41:58,423 --> 00:41:59,383
Me too.

698
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:03,383
