=Lady Revenger Returns From the Fire=

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,184
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:26,252
Zong Wei's birthday is two days away.

4
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:28,853
I am going to Baili Gorge to visit him

5
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,892
so that he may bless me
with great success.

6
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:34,053
You go and prepare the offerings.

7
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:35,773
Yes.

8
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:37,213
This time,

9
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:39,252
only a team of elite guards go with me.

10
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:40,493
Remember.

11
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:43,972
Keep a low profile
and travel discreetly.

12
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:45,972
I see.

13
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:54,133
Your Highness, allow me to guess.

14
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:56,653
Visiting Zong Wei is but a ruse,
and getting the map

15
00:01:57,053 --> 00:01:58,213
is your real intention, right?

16
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:06,573
You are clever.

17
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:08,172
I think

18
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:10,253
now that we just
obtained the developing water,

19
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:11,892
shouldn't we lay low for a while

20
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:13,253
before going to get the map?

21
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:14,612
That will be safe.

22
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:15,133
No.

23
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:18,693
Xu Chengfeng has died,

24
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:20,573
and the minister has returned.

25
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:22,932
Even if Shen Zishan and Shen Danqing

26
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:25,612
try to tell the minister
that I have had the developing water,

27
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:26,732
it will take several days.

28
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,052
Doing things

29
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,612
by surprise is the best choice.

30
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:32,732
I see.

31
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:35,133
You're wise.

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,558
(Shen Mansion)

33
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:47,013
This is the winery's ledger

34
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:48,533
and the formulas

35
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:51,813
of Rose Liquor and Chengfeng Wine.

36
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:55,052
Now the winery has taken off.

37
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:57,573
With you and Shuixian helping Zishan,

38
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:58,973
I will be relieved.

39
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:00,813
Miss.

40
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,732
Are you not going
to manage the winery anymore?

41
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:05,172
I'm afraid I can't.

42
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,732
Prince Yi has had the developing water.

43
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:09,413
I don't know
when he will go to get the map.

44
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,693
He will surely use many cons.

45
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:13,533
I must watch him closely

46
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:14,892
and can't miss the chance.

47
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:18,293
I must catch him red-handed.

48
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,772
But it's too dangerous.

49
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:22,172
You cannot act alone.

50
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:23,892
Mr. Qin is right.

51
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:28,373
Danqing, I will go with you.

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,573
The house and Escort Agency need you.

53
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,293
You have many things to do now.

54
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:35,452
Don't worry. Tianhao will go with me.

55
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:38,573
I must

56
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:41,172
avenge Xu Chengfeng.

57
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,093
Chengfeng died for the two of us.

58
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:45,652
Speaking of revenge,

59
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,253
I must be in.

60
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,652
We must obtain the map at any cost.

61
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:55,892
The two of us

62
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,732
must personally bring Prince Yi

63
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:00,932
to justice.

64
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:03,693
Mr. Shen, Miss Shen.

65
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:05,932
Why are you here?

66
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,373
I have important things to tell you.

67
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,092
Come with me.

68
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:44,013
Yes.

69
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,368
(Tomb of Zong Wei)

70
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:20,092
Your Highness.

71
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,212
This is where I saved you

72
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,013
when you were little.

73
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,013
I've buried you here.

74
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,332
I've finished what I started.

75
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:44,972
Zong Wei.

76
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:47,493
You won't blame me, right?

77
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:01,613
Today is your birthday.

78
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:04,852
This is your favorite snack.

79
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:09,013
In this life, I feel guilty about you.

80
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:13,173
Remember to find me in your next life,

81
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:15,933
so I can make it up to you.

82
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:17,452
(Unexpectedly,)

83
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:20,933
(he looks so sad for a personal guard.)

84
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:36,332
I feel safe
only when hiding the treasure map here.

85
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:38,013
That's because I know

86
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,133
you will guard it well for me.

87
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,332
I won't let you sacrifice

88
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:44,092
(Tomb of Zong Wei)
in vain.

89
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,412
Congratulations, Your Highness.
You're gonna get what you want.

90
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:39,733
Xu Chengfeng.

91
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:41,453
Y-You're not dead?

92
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:43,493
Your Highness,
you didn't expect this, did you?

93
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,408
Know the game, and you'll live.
Break it, and you'll win.

94
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:48,052
In the game between you and me,

95
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,692
I am the true controller.

96
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:51,412
Well played, Xu Chengfeng.

97
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:53,772
You actually conspired with the minister

98
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:55,453
and faked your death to deceive me.

99
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:56,932
As for this conspiracy,

100
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:58,213
I am no match for you.

101
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:01,733
Heaven knows you're insatiable
and ignoring the law,

102
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:04,333
so it gives me the opportunity
to set things right.

103
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,133
I've annihilated the skilled fighters

104
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:08,692
you ambushed.

105
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,412
Surrender immediately!

106
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:12,772
I've already obtained the treasure map.

107
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:15,333
Who can stop me?

108
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,013
Your Highness,
cease your futile resistance.

109
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:19,652
After all, you are a royal relative.

110
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:22,333
As long as you turn back in time
and hand over the stolen goods,

111
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,333
and given His Majesty's benevolence,

112
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:26,493
perhaps he will spare your life.

113
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:28,373
Please do not make yourself

114
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:30,093
doomed eternally.

115
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:32,532
Carve a bloody path through them.

116
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:33,932
I'll give you a substantial reward.

117
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:34,493
Kill!

118
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,253
(I can't leave.)

119
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:28,493
(I'll have a chance
if I follow Prince Yi.)

120
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:51,412
It's Chengfeng. He isn't dead.

121
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:57,320
Mr. Shen, Miss Shen.

122
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,812
Please come with me.

123
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:00,493
Where to?

124
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:01,973
To meet the general.

125
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:06,493
What did you say?

126
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:07,652
The general isn't dead.

127
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:09,412
He's in Baili Gorge.

128
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:11,932
The general is going
to catch Prince Yi red-handed.

129
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,493
You mean Xu Chengfeng is alive?

130
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:15,652
Yes.

131
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:17,213
No time to explain.

132
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:18,772
Let's go to Baili Gorge.

133
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:20,853
Once you see him,
everything will be clear.

134
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:22,493
Danqing.

135
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:23,133
Miss.

136
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:25,333
He's not dead.

137
00:11:59,013 --> 00:11:59,652
You're not dead.

138
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,613
I promised none of us would die.

139
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:29,932
Xue'er, give me the treasure map.

140
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:44,253
Danqing, be careful!

141
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:48,812
Don't move!

142
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:51,572
Don't hurt her!

143
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:05,253
Let Luo Xue'er go,

144
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:06,932
and I will release her.

145
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,133
Don't.

146
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:11,652
Release her!

147
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:22,453
Your Highness.

148
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:23,532
Give me the map.

149
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,613
Don't give it to him.
He's desperate now.

150
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:26,812
You'll meet a dead end with him.

151
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:27,692
Shut up.

152
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:28,692
He trusts me.

153
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:30,093
I will not betray him.

154
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,093
Even if I have to run with him,

155
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,453
I am willing to do so.

156
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,932
Danqing, are you alright?

157
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:46,453
Your Highness.

158
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,572
I swear to follow you to death.

159
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,892
Good, I can grant that wish.

160
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,253
Stop them.

161
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,412
Charge!

162
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:12,493
Take good care of Danqing.

163
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:14,292
Charge!

164
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:53,733
I have to admit

165
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,613
you were right.

166
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,453
Desire has blinded my eyes.

167
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,133
I confuse right and wrong

168
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:05,853
and trust the wrong person.

169
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:10,253
My entire life has been a mistake.

170
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,052
It is time to end this.

171
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:15,853
If you can turn back,

172
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:17,973
it will not be late.

173
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:20,812
One mistake

174
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:23,133
leads to more.

175
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,613
How can I continue to live?

176
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:37,572
Do you remember the painting
father left for us?

177
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:40,973
No matter what happens,

178
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:44,532
we will always be sisters.

179
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:47,292
Father.

180
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:51,572
I mistook him.

181
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:54,600
And I mistakenly killed him.

182
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:59,172
I have committed sins in this life,

183
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,932
and I will make it up in my next life.

184
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:06,292
Don't move. Save your strength.

185
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:10,504
♪Sometimes, there's no right or wrong♪

186
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:12,772
It's too late.

187
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,493
If there is an afterlife,

188
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,812
let us be sisters again.

You keep your martial arts well hidden.

206
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:52,332
Why are you so persistent?

207
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,812
If you help me obtain the treasure
to divide

208
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,733
and rule the nation
with the current emperor,

209
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:58,453
you will be a founding official.

210
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:01,052
It's more prestigious
than being a mere general.

211
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:03,052
If I had such intentions,

212
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:05,772
why would I trick you in prison?

213
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,852
I've fought against you
for so many years,

214
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,132
but you still don't know me well.

215
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,413
No matter whom you serve,
you have to bow.

216
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:14,413
If you want more,

217
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,253
I can make you king.

218
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,013
Cut the crap.

219
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,453
I have already told you.

220
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,532
I will capture you, a rebel,

221
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:23,852
and bring you to justice.

222
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,173
Fine.

223
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:27,413
Today will be your doom.

224
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:19,052
Your Highness.

225
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:20,772
You're caught red-handed.

226
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,292
Surrender.

227
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,733
Chengfeng, why did you deceive me?

228
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:17,653
Why did you hurt me?

229
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:19,332
I'm sorry, Danqing.

230
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:22,933
I made a bet with myself,

231
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:25,052
betting if I could come back to life.

232
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:31,213
Fortunately, I won the bet.

233
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:36,893
My oversight fails you, minister.

234
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:39,013
Chengfeng.

235
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,453
If you hadn't
hidden Shen Danqing's identity,

236
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,612
things couldn't have ended up like this.

237
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,013
I made a mistake.

238
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:46,453
Right now,

239
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:47,933
we must act.

240
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:49,372
It's not too late.

241
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:50,372
We act?

242
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:54,772
Have you thought of a remedy?

243
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:57,413
It's a last throw of the dice.

244
00:21:58,772 --> 00:22:00,332
I'm willing to exchange my own life

245
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:01,733
for the ultimate victory.

246
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:03,092
Are you saying

247
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:05,173
you want to sacrifice your life?

248
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:07,933
Firstly, I'll tell Prince Yi

249
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:10,572
that the developing water will not work
in less than half a month.

250
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:13,493
The treasure map he tried to obtain

251
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:15,092
might be a worthless piece of paper.

252
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:17,453
Then I let him know

253
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:20,733
that only Danqing
can make the developing water.

254
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,812
He will surely seize the only chance.

255
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:24,013
In that way,

256
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:26,253
Danqing will be safe.

257
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:29,572
Only you could come up with

258
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:30,493
such an elaborate plan

259
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:32,372
under adverse conditions.

260
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,052
Minister.

261
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:36,332
To make

262
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,493
Danqing produce
the developing water quickly,

263
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:41,653
he will try every means
to expedite the case closure.

264
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:42,772
By that time,

265
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:44,612
I just need to admit guilt

266
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:45,733
and kill myself.

267
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:48,332
This is the best method.

268
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:50,132
Once you are dead,

269
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:52,453
this case will be closed.

270
00:22:52,852 --> 00:22:54,572
I'll have to leave Liao City.

271
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:58,332
This way, Prince Yi will
be even more unrestrained

272
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:01,292
and might slip up.

273
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:02,733
Are you thinking

274
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:05,292
of finding a chance in desperation?

275
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:06,493
Exactly.

276
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:09,292
Mr. Miao has a miraculous medicine.

277
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:13,532
It can make one hold their breath,
feign death, and preserve life.

278
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,812
I hope that you can get it for me.

279
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,612
It's indeed a good plan.

280
00:23:20,013 --> 00:23:22,332
But you'll be in danger.

281
00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:24,973
There must be no mistakes.

282
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:28,132
And we're not sure
if the drug will take effect in time.

283
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,372
I cannot guarantee your safety.

284
00:23:31,092 --> 00:23:32,132
Chengfeng.

285
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:35,852
You must carefully consider it.

286
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:38,372
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

287
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:40,893
As a strategist,

288
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:42,413
I can make use of everything,

289
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,372
including my body,

290
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:46,213
my life, and death.

291
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:48,013
Chengfeng.

292
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:50,292
You must survive.

293
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:54,292
(Zong Wei's poison is very potent.)

294
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:56,493
Fortunately,
Mr. Miao's pill protected me.

295
00:23:57,173 --> 00:23:58,413
It was a near escape.

296
00:23:58,693 --> 00:23:59,653
I've been in a coma for days

297
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:01,092
and finally come back to life.

298
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:04,013
Only then did I have Tianhao notify you.

299
00:24:05,332 --> 00:24:06,493
You promise me.

300
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:09,213
Never do this again.

301
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,453
Never break my heart again.

302
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:13,253
Never leave me again.

303
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:14,213
Okay.

304
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:15,413
Okay.

305
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,013
I promise you.

306
00:24:22,132 --> 00:24:23,612
In fact, I was not very sure

307
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:24,893
if I could survive.

308
00:24:26,893 --> 00:24:27,933
But I believed

309
00:24:28,572 --> 00:24:29,852
I could certainly do it.

310
00:24:31,493 --> 00:24:33,013
You gave me the courage.

311
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:35,772
Me?

312
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:38,213
I have never been defeated in battle.

313
00:24:39,132 --> 00:24:41,092
In the past, I did it
with my solitary courage.

314
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:43,173
But now, things change.

315
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,213
Now, I rely on you.

316
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:48,933
I promised to spend our lives together.

317
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:51,092
I must keep my promise.

318
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:52,733
Rest assured,

319
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,013
I'll never leave you alone
in this world.

320
00:24:58,824 --> 00:24:59,532
It's all in the past.

321
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:02,173
Thank the heavens

322
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,213
for letting us meet again

323
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:07,933
I promise you.

324
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,292
I will never leave you again.

325
00:25:18,568 --> 00:25:20,413
(Danqing Winery)

326
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:22,693
(After Miss Shuangshuang met her mother
in prison,)

327
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,772
she seemed different.

328
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:25,852
She's learning winemaking at the winery.

329
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,453
Hopefully, she truly repents.

330
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:30,493
Can't seal it.

331
00:25:30,493 --> 00:25:32,332
The fermentation time is insufficient.

332
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:33,612
It'll affect the wine's quality.

333
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:35,013
What do you know about it?

334
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:37,013
I've always sealed the original liquor

335
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:39,253
after the same fermentation time.

336
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:41,092
It never goes wrong.

337
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,372
This year is cold.

338
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:44,532
Fermentation time needs to be longer.

339
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:47,052
You can't be so inflexible.

340
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:49,013
How long have you made wine?

341
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:50,733
Are you teaching me how to do my job?

342
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:51,693
She is right.

343
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,013
- Miss.
- Miss.

344
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:00,933
If we want to ensure a consistent taste
of the original liquor,

345
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:01,852
the fermentation time

346
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,104
needs to be adjusted
according to temperature changes.

347
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:06,292
But some customers

348
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:08,653
may want different tastes,

349
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:10,572
so the wine brewed
at the same time each year

350
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:12,572
can have the same fermentation time.

351
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:13,612
I see.

352
00:26:14,332 --> 00:26:16,013
The fermentation time
of the original liquor

353
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:18,532
depends on what kind of finished wine
the customers need.

354
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,493
Correct.

355
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:22,213
So neither of you is wrong.

356
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:24,852
Alright, dismissed.

357
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:25,812
Go back to your work.

358
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:26,973
Yes.

359
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:28,092
Let's go.

360
00:26:28,092 --> 00:26:29,292
You two, follow me.

361
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:34,933
Miss Shen, thank you for rescuing me

362
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,292
and for letting me stay
to learn winemaking.

363
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:39,052
You're welcome.

364
00:26:39,372 --> 00:26:42,933
However, you should call me sister.

365
00:26:45,213 --> 00:26:45,893
(Sister.)

366
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:48,973
I didn't expect you
to have gone through so much after that.

367
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:52,292
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

368
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:53,612
I'm sorry.

369
00:26:56,372 --> 00:26:57,973
Alright, have a seat.

370
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:03,973
Sister.

371
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,372
I wonder if I could ask a question.

372
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:09,413
You ultimately suffered because of us.

373
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:12,572
Are you truly willing to forgive us?

374
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:16,372
You were arrogant and selfish before.

375
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:18,572
But now, you've changed.

376
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,453
You've suffered what you deserved.

377
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:24,372
Isn't the purpose of punishment
to reform oneself?

378
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:25,893
Since the purpose has been achieved,

379
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:28,132
why must I put you in prison?

380
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:29,693
Thank you, sister.

381
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,933
Thank you for pleading for me

382
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:33,933
and helping me avoid prison time.

383
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:36,693
Anyway, everything has passed.

384
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:40,392
You seemed professional
when you brewed wine.

385
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:43,772
Actually, father hoped

386
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:44,933
that we could support each other

387
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:46,772
and run the winery well.

388
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:49,653
It seems the winery
will rely not only on me

389
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:51,092
but also on you.

390
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:01,132
This is the dowry father left for you.

391
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:02,653
(To Shuangshuang)
There are a letter

392
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:04,572
and a wine formula inside.

393
00:28:06,332 --> 00:28:07,173
Shuangshuang.

394
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:08,933
I hope

395
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:11,532
we can together
fulfill father's last wishes.

396
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:13,812
Though we are women,

397
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:15,332
we are not inferior to men.

398
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:17,893
I always believe
that it all depends on our efforts.

399
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:19,332
Only by relying on ourselves

400
00:28:19,812 --> 00:28:22,013
can we secure a place in this world.

401
00:28:24,893 --> 00:28:27,173
From now on, we work together

402
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:28,413
to make our wine business known

403
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:30,213
throughout the world.

404
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:33,132
Okay, I got it.

405
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:35,372
Being independent matters to a woman.

406
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:37,812
If I always rely on others
for everything,

407
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:39,653
no one will respect me.

408
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:42,973
I will not let Father and you down

409
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:46,013
and make our wine business boom.

410
00:28:56,936 --> 00:29:00,488
(The late younger sister Luo's Xue'er)

411
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:18,292
Father.

412
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:20,733
I haven't failed your trust.

413
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:23,213
I have managed the winery

414
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:24,772
very well.

415
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:28,653
Chengfeng Wine and Rose Liquor

416
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:30,973
are quite popular.

417
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:33,612
And Shuangshuang.

418
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:35,453
She has grown up

419
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:37,332
and can stand on her own.

420
00:29:38,572 --> 00:29:39,772
Shuangshuang and I

421
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:41,493
will jointly support the household

422
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:43,772
and not let you down.

423
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:01,092
Danqing.

424
00:30:01,812 --> 00:30:04,213
Do you want to be Luo Ailian again?

425
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:09,893
Now that I have become Shen Danqing,

426
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,332
I should adopt a new identity

427
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:14,332
to face a new life.

428
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:17,132
No matter what difficulties

429
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:19,173
and experiences I used to face,

430
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,092
I am grateful.

431
00:30:22,132 --> 00:30:22,973
They have made me

432
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,132
what I am today.

433
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,253
Okay.

434
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:30,532
Whatever decision you make,

435
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:32,733
I will support you.

436
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:39,812
Luo Ailian.

437
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:44,013
I hope all the hardships will be gone
with you.

438
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:47,092
And Shen Danqing

439
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:50,532
will have a bright and smooth future.

(Royal Escort Agency)

441
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:58,092
- Great.
- Great.

442
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:00,693
Awesome.

443
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:01,772
Great.

444
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:02,733
Great.

445
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:04,328
Great.

447
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,132
The plaque of the Royal Escort Agency

448
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,092
has finally returned to us.

449
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:16,292
Congratulations.

450
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,213
We swear to work with you

451
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:20,413
and live up to the title
of the Royal Escort Agency.

452
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,173
Congratulations

453
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,693
on regaining the glory.

454
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:26,253
Your wish has been fulfilled.

455
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:27,453
Congratulations to you

456
00:31:27,572 --> 00:31:29,413
on merging Danqing Winery
with Ganlu Brewery

457
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:31,092
to become the largest winery
in the industry.

458
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,092
Luo Ailian has been exonerated.

459
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:35,973
The long-reputed Moonlit Encounter
can finally resume production.

460
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:38,893
Thanks, Zishan.

461
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:41,893
It's finally back.

462
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:44,933
Thank you all for your support.

463
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:47,132
I hope in the days to come,

464
00:31:47,493 --> 00:31:48,612
we join hands

465
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:50,453
to make Escort Agency famous
far and wide.

466
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:53,332
- Great.
- Great.

467
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:59,693
- Great.
- Great.

(Royal Escort Agency)

469
00:32:06,632 --> 00:32:09,032
(Danqing Winery)

470
00:32:38,812 --> 00:32:40,013
When I arrived in Liao City,

471
00:32:40,493 --> 00:32:42,693
I heard that you merged Danqing Winery

472
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:44,213
with the Ganlu Brewery.

473
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:46,772
And you've opened a fine bottle
of Moonlit Encounter.

474
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,132
It sounds so good.

475
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,733
Why didn't you wait for me to join you?

476
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:53,812
Someone told me
he would always be with me.

477
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:55,372
But suddenly, he was gone.

478
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:56,772
Do you think he should be punished?

479
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,173
Yes.

480
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:04,392
I had to escort Prince Yi
back to the capital,

481
00:33:05,372 --> 00:33:07,052
so I returned to report to His Majesty.

482
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:10,013
Alright, I know
you have official duties,

483
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:12,013
so I warmed the wine for you in advance,

484
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:13,413
hoping to relieve your fatigue.

485
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:15,612
It's the special Chengfeng Wine for you.

486
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:18,852
Turns out my dear wife is so virtuous.

487
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:21,812
Who is your wife?

488
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,453
What? Are you going back on your word?

489
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:27,772
It's too late now.

490
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,733
When I returned to see His Majesty,

491
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,532
His Majesty praised me
for guarding the map

492
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,052
and asked what reward I desired.

493
00:33:33,332 --> 00:33:34,493
I said I wanted nothing.

494
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:35,893
No fame or fortune.

495
00:33:36,332 --> 00:33:37,532
And no promotion or noble title.

496
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:39,933
I only asked His Majesty
to grant me a marriage

497
00:33:40,612 --> 00:33:42,653
so that we may marry soon.

498
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:45,132
Now you're a general's wife bestowed
by His Majesty.

499
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,092
You're my wife.

500
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:49,653
You can't get rid of me forever.

501
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:51,893
Danqing.

502
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,173
I want to hear your answer once again.

503
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:59,372
Are you willing to marry me

504
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:01,372
and let me protect you for a lifetime?

505
00:34:04,572 --> 00:34:07,132
No matter how many times you ask me,

506
00:34:07,272 --> 00:34:08,612
my answer will always be

507
00:34:09,652 --> 00:34:10,652
yes.

557
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:53,572
You can't go in.

558
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:54,933
- Let me in.
- You can't.

559
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:55,773
Don't stop me.

560
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:56,732
Who's it outside?

561
00:39:56,732 --> 00:39:57,532
It's urgent.

562
00:39:57,532 --> 00:39:58,092
General.

563
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,493
A fortune-teller wants
to talk to Mrs. Xu.

564
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:02,333
A fortune-teller?

565
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:04,572
It's okay. Let him in.

566
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:07,612
Come in.

567
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:18,813
Congratulations, Ms. Shen.

568
00:40:19,493 --> 00:40:22,013
No, it is Ms. Luo.

569
00:40:25,652 --> 00:40:27,212
What brings you here?

570
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:29,973
Someone asked me to deliver a letter.

571
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:32,293
It's a congratulatory gift for you.

572
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:45,813
(To Shen Danqing)
Now that I've given you the letter,

573
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,813
I'll take my leave.

574
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,333
After countless trials,

575
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,973
you've finally married the right man.

576
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:57,933
But everything carries both fortune
and misfortune.

577
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:00,333
Fate is predestined yet uncertain.

578
00:41:00,813 --> 00:41:03,528
May you continue to overcome obstacles

579
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:04,853
toward a bright future.
