Yeah, it is.

00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:03,750
If there is liquor to drink,
it will be perfect.

6
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,589
General, don't forget I own a winery.

7
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:09,430
How could there be no liquor? Just wait.

8
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,030
Thank you for acting with me
and helping me out with the trouble.

9
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:29,549
General, I give you a toast.

10
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,016
Okay.

11
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,949
Good liquor.

12
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,910
It was specially prepared
for the opening of my new store.

13
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,360
Today, I brought it for you to taste it.
General, what do you think of it?

14
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:51,829
Your liquor business will be good.

15
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,590
But this liquor...

16
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,350
What about it?

17
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,709
This liquor tastes good.

18
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,709
It reminds me of another fine liquor
with a lingering aftertaste.

19
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,630
Miss Shen, do you know
Ganlu Brewery's Moonlit Encounter?

20
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:18,669
What's the matter?

21
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,910
Moonlit Encounter is good liquor.

22
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,509
It's also quite unforgettable.

23
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,030
The liquor makes us kindred spirits.

24
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,430
General, I give you a toast.

25
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,430

27

Actually, there's been something
I've wanted to ask you.

28
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,709
Why did you decide to open a winery?

29
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,350
And right across from the Ganlu Brewery?

30
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:10,070
The Luo family framed me
and nearly took my life.

31
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,030
They also put the Shen family
in jeopardy.

32
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,269
How could I let them bully me?

33
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,509
I must give tit for tat
and make them pay the price.

34
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,310
General, I've loved making liquor
since I was little.

35
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,870
So, I wanted to defeat them
in my own way.

36
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,310
I know a great general
like you will certainly sneeze

37
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,909
at my vengeful actions, right?

38
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,750
That's not true.

I never show mercy to the enemy.

it's necessary to make them pay.

51

But this is already the second time
I've acted with you.

00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,310
At the first time,
I was a heartless man.

Ganlu Brewery has lost some big deals.

70
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,509
We've suffered successive losses.

71
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:56,990
It's costly to repair the ancestral hall
that was destroyed in the fire.

72
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,709
We've been beyond our means.

The money we have now

74
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,630

Miss Xue'er,
if you don't think of a solution,

76
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,709
I'm afraid Ganlu Brewery will fail.

77
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,870
Withdraw all the banknotes
and exchange them for gold yuanbao.

78
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:17,630
What?

79
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,128

of getting through the crisis.

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,709
Within half a month,

81
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,430
I must revive Ganlu Brewery.

82
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,624
Understood.

83
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,310
Hasn't the store
across the street shut down?

84
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:36,310
Perhaps Ms. Song hasn't scared them off.

85
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,392
An outsider like her tries to compete
with me in business. She's doomed.

Just ignore her for the time being.

87
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,872
Mmm.

88
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,829
Mr. Miao has sent the medical records
of Danqing's poisoning

89
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,550
to the capital city for comparison
and investigation. Some clues are found.

90
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,110
That's great.

91
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,230
Danqing was poisoned
with a deadly poison, Blood Night Bloomer.

92
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,949
Those poisoned will die very soon.

93
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:05,709
These symptoms are copied
from ancient books.

94
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,870
Exactly the same as the ones
Danqing had at the time.

95
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,349
Miss Shen was poisoned
with Blood Night Bloomer.

96
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,230
The lock was corroded
by Dissolving Powder.

97
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:16,750
If that's the case,

98
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,070
we should focus our attention on those

99
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,029
skilled in using both types of poisons.

100
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,310
Thus we can identify
who was behind this.

101
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:25,480
Exactly.

102
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,389
Now with this clue,
we are closer to the truth.

103
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,190
Zishan, I'll mobilize manpower
to search thoroughly right away.

104
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,949
I'll also mobilize my men.

105
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,229
I know a scout in the black market.

106
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:39,989
I can ask her to investigate it.

107
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:42,349
You mean Know-it-all?

108
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,790
Do you know her?

109
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:46,949
I saw her before.

110
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:49,469
But she sticks to principles
and doesn't work

111
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:50,430
with authorities.

112
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:54,550
However, if you can go to her
with a clue,

113
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,390
maybe she won't refuse you.

114
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,869
Miss Lv Zhu.

115
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:00,430
What's going on?

116
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,790
General Tianhao,
the weather has been dry lately,

117
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,310
so I made plum juice for the general.

118
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,829
The general has eaten
too many apricots recently,

119
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,989
causing acid reflux,
so he can't drink plum juice.

120
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,190
I'll drink this.

121
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:18,150
I made other things for the general.

122
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,869
What? Show me.

123
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,310
I don't drink plum juice.

124
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,270
Miss Lv Zhu,
don't trouble yourself for me.

125
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,550
I told you, Miss Lv Zhu.

126
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,349
The general is chatting with a guest.

127
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:32,790
It's not appropriate
for you to barge in.

128
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,510
I didn't mean to disturb you.

129
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,349
General, don't you want the recipe
for the Qizi pastries?

130
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:39,430
I've brought it for you.

131
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,829
If you want to eat them,
I will make them for you.

132
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:42,664
No need.

133
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,190
General.

134
00:09:46,349 --> 00:09:47,190
I told you.

135
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,912
Alright, take it.

136
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,670
Why did you not give it to me just now?

137
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,349
General, here is the note
that Lv Zhu sent by a homing pigeon.

138
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,016
(Know-it-all)

139
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,550
Although Lv Zhu seems naive,

140
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:26,109
we must not let our guard down
in case she may be feigning innocence.

141
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:29,949
Prince Yi's intention might be
to make us underestimate her.

142
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:31,629
And eventually,
we'll stop being wary of her.

143
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,229
Rest assured, General,
I will keep an eye on her.

144
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:36,392
You may leave.

145
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,589
Miss Xue'er, what can I do for you?

146
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,109
I would like to use your prestige
in the Brewers Association

147
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:50,589
to help Ganlu Brewery out.

148
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,270
(Chairman Xia of Brewers Association)
Are you planning to open a branch?

149
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,589
If you want me to back you up,
it's not difficult.

150
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,270
To be honest, I found a magical spring
suitable for brewing.

151
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,629
The liquor brewed with the spring water
is very sweet and intoxicating.

152
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,109
But if everyone uses it to brew liquor,

153
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:12,150
the spring water will be commonplace.

154
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,944
So, what's your plan?

155
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,910
Let Ganlu Brewery
use this spring water exclusively.

156
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,229
That seems hardly appropriate.

157
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,589
According to the rules
of the Brewers Association,

158
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,869
whoever finds the water source
for brewing must share it.

159
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:31,469
I am aware of this rule.

160
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,469
That's why I ask you for help.

161
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,629
And I got you a little gift.

162
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,510
I hope you like it.

163
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:45,910
Of course, this is just the appetizer.

164
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:48,749
If Ganlu Brewery gets exclusive rights,

165
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,190
you will get more delicacies.

166
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,229
Moreover, I have thought of a plan.

167
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:56,949
You just need to give a little push.

168
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:58,910
It will not cause you any trouble.

169
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,989
Is it foolproof?

170
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:08,390
At that time, you only need to...

171
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:18,190
Miss, it's okay to make the spigot
with your blueprint.

172
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,030
(Spigot water outlet)
But this part.

173
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:21,629
It's not necessary.

174
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,512
And it will waste a lot of metal.
Not worth it at all.

175
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:29,310
I advise you to use my blueprint.

176
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:32,190
No, it must be built with my blueprint.

177
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,190
Not a single error is permitted.

178
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:36,589
I have my reasons.

179
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:38,109
Alright.

180
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:47,190
(Various Liquor Names)

181
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,310
Miss, have you heard?

182
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,989
All liquor merchants
have received Chairman Xia's invitation.

183
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,749
It says that a liquor worship ceremony
will be held in seven days.

184
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,229
This ceremony is held every year.

185
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:03,349
It's different this year. I heard
Luo Xue'er has found a mountain spring.

186
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,510
She also funded the renovation
of the spring's source.

187
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,790
Chairman Xia offered to select the one
qualified to use the spring water

188
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,949
through a divine decree
in the liquor worship ceremony.

189
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:14,229
Divine decree? What's he up to?

190
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:17,469
The location for this ceremony is

191
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:19,469
near the Luo family's ancestral graves.

192
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,704
Now the Luo family's business
is not as booming as it used to be.

193
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,869
Why did she benevolently
renovate the spring's source?

194
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:30,829
Luo Xue'er never
does a loss-making business.

195
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:34,229
Every investment she makes
is well-calculated.

196
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,589
You mean she has ulterior motives?

197
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,030
Shuixian, ask Mr. Lin
to keep a close eye on her.

198
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:45,150
I want to see what she's up to.

199
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:46,696
Yes.

200
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:54,709
(General's Mansion)

201
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,070
(Miss Shen, please.)

202
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,869
General, Miss Shen is here.

203
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,469
You came at this late hour.
What can I do for you?

204
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,629
General, could you accompany me
to a place tomorrow?

205
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,030
Tomorrow?

206
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,190
So, are you asking me out right now?

207
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,469
You can take it as you like.

208
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,709
So, is that a yes?

209
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,989
I indeed don't have anything planned
for tomorrow.

210
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:43,510
Okay. See you at Luo's ancestral grave
at Chen hour tomorrow.

211
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,589
The ancestral grave?
The meeting place is quite unusual.

212
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:03,670
Today is the yearly worship ceremony.

213
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,030
It's also the most important day
for the Brewers Association.

214
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:11,109
Miss Xue'er from the Ganlu Brewery

215
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,349
discovered the Liquor Spring.

216
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:16,829
She and I will unveil the Liquor Spring.

217
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,070
- Great.
- Great.

218
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,829
You asked me to come just to see this?

219
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:23,949
This is a rare show.

220
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,430
I assure you it won't be a wasted trip.

221
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,229
- Great.
- Great.

222
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:41,270
- Great.
- Great.

223
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:48,869
Good spring.

224
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:52,430
Since the Liquor Spring
is a serendipitous gift from heaven.

225
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,310
I believe the right to use the spring
will be decided by heaven.

226
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:03,430
We beg the Liquor God to give a decree
to decide who the spring belongs to.

227
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:06,030
- Okay.
- Yes.

228
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,910
Here's the method.

229
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,430
The golden spigot will spill water
onto the yellow paper.

230
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,670
The yellow paper will reveal some words

231
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,550
to display the name of a winery.

232
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,469
The winery will be the one chosen
by heaven

233
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:25,510
and granted the supreme right
to use the Liquor Spring for brewing.

234
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,390
- Great.
- Great.

235
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,670
It's indeed a great drama.

236
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:36,949
Why don't we guess
which winery's name will appear?

237
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:39,749
I think no matter whose name it is,

238
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,270
it would be better to make the spring
benefit the wineries in Liao City.

239
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,349
That would be best
for the benefit of the people.

240
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,664
(Danqing Winery)

241
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,030
(Danqing Winery? How is that possible?)

242
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,149
- Danqing Winery?
- Never heard of it.

243
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,629
It's owned by Miss Shen Danqing
of Shen Escort Agency.

244
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:18,669
It is interesting.

245
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:19,510
It hasn't opened yet.

246
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,829
Shen Escort Agency is also involved
in this business with a divine decree?

247
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,550
As Chairman Xia said,

248
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,990
the name appears on the yellow paper
by the will of heaven.

249
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:34,109
So Danqing Winery is the user
of this spring.

250
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:36,990
Shen Danqing, did you fiddle with it?

251
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:40,470
Miss Xue'er, aren't you slandering me?

252
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,950
I just came to witness this ceremony.

253
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,448
Besides, I've been standing off-stage.

254
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:47,750
How could I possibly do that?

255
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,389
General Xu has been standing by my side.

256
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:51,950
He can testify for me.

257
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,710
Indeed, Miss Shen has been
by my side the whole time.

258
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,109
Everyone here can testify.

259
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,990
You have always been cunning. Who knows
if you fiddled with it beforehand?

260
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,109
This selection method was announced
by you on the spot today.

261
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:08,629
How could I have fiddled with it
in advance?

262
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,470
You're so certain about that.

263
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,869
Could it not be a divine decree,
but rather an act?

264
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:19,669
It's a divine decree.

265
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:21,869
Don't talk nonsense.

266
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,429
If you're not convinced,

267
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,349
you can try with another piece of paper.
I don't mind.

268
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,030
(She has seen through
the trap I set up.)

269
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:34,950
(No need to try a few more times.
I have to think of another way.)

270
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,550
Everyone,
I'm not intentionally stopping it.

271
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,829
Danqing Winery is not a member
of the Brewers Association.

272
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:49,030
The winery to use the spring is selected
among the members of the association.

273
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,056
Her winery isn't qualified.

274
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,904
Therefore, today's result
should rightfully be invalidated.

275
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,589
We should hold the ceremony
at another time.

276
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,030
Chairman Xia, please announce
we'll hold another ceremony.

277
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,744
Okay.

278
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,310
General Xu,
do you have any instructions?

279
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,270
I have only come to watch the ceremony.

280
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,470
No need to ask for my opinion
on the Brewers Association.

281
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,280
Alright.

282
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:19,030
Chairman Xia, the association members
are rarely gathered together like this.

283
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,510
Why not have everyone vote
right here and now

284
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,189
to decide whether Danqing Winery
can become a member of the association?

285
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,589
The divine decree is present. I hope
you will give Danqing Winery a chance.

286
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,950
Yes, after all, this is the result
of the divine decree.

287
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,109
If it is overturned,
it will anger the heaven.

288
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,710
Yes, what if it provokes the heaven?

289
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:40,109
It makes sense.

290
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,629
Everyone, please be quiet
and hear me out.

291
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,470
Danqing Winery is just a new store
that has not yet opened.

292
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,710
And Shen Danqing is even an outsider
who has never got into this business.

293
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:52,389
If she gains the right
to use the spring,

294
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,990
unconstrained by the rules
of our industry,

295
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:56,990
I'm afraid it could lead to disaster.

296
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,349
That's right. She's not a member
of the association.

297
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,149
We can't let her benefit from this.

298
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:08,589
All of you are my seniors.

299
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,429
I open the winery because I love liquor.

300
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,470
I do not wish to exceed others
or compete with you for fame and profit.

301
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,990
I also believe that the association
is not a place for harming each other.

302
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,990
Rather, it is a place to unify us
and brew good liquor.

303
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,990
If everyone agrees to let Danqing Winery
become a member of the association,

304
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,829
I am willing to share my right to use
with everyone.

305
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,629
If there are no objections,
let's vote by a show of hands.

306
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:37,710
If that's the case, I agree.

307
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,550
I also agree.

308
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,109
I agree.

309
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,750
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

310
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,550
Agreed.

311
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,070
Agreed.

312
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,710
Agreed.

313
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,669
Agreed.

314
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,909
I also agree.

315
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,550
I also agree.
Just follow the divine decree.

316
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,990
Danqing Winery
can join the Brewers Association.

317
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,189
- Great.
- Great.

318
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,790
Miss Xue'er, any objections?

319
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:06,429
As you wish.

320
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,270
Chairman Xia, please proceed.

321
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:17,736
Great.

322
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:24,869
I announce that Danqing Winery
has joined the Brewers Association.

323
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:29,270
- Great.
- Great.

324
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,790
- Great.
- Great.

325
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,230
Thank you all for your support.

326
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,470
I look forward to joining hands
with everyone

327
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,429
and make Liao City's liquor renowned
throughout the realm.

328
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:43,270
- Great.
- Great.

329
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,070
Well said.

330
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,389
General, here's to you.
Thank you for your trust in me.

331
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:54,376
You didn't ruin my act
during the ceremony,

332
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,669
securing welfare
for Liao City's liquor merchants.

333
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:02,349
You're willing to share the spring water
with all merchants.

334
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:04,070
I haven't misplaced my trust in you.

335
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:13,109
General, you won't blame me
for using you?

336
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:14,669
You invited me to go with you

337
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,750
not to use my status
to seek personal gain,

338
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:22,824
but to make those cheaters hold back,

339
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:24,750
so they won't act rashly, right?

340
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:28,680
However, there is one thing
I am very curious about.

341
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,950
How exactly did you do it?

342
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:37,909
Put this piece of caustic soda
in the hidden compartment of the spigot.

343
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,589
Make sure
that when the spigot is opened,

344
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:43,589
water will flow out
from the compartment with caustic soda.

345
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:47,144
Miss Xue'er, why? I don't understand

346
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,629
You don't need to. Just do as I say.

347
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,459
But...

348
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:54,389
Keep your mouth shut
if you want the money.

349
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,550
You will get a generous reward
for doing this well.

350
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,790
If you fail, I have ways
to make your life worse than death.

351
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:03,080
Yes.

352
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:05,669
The caustic soda.

353
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:09,224
So it's the key to making words visible
on the yellow paper?

354
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:13,389
Exactly. Luo Xue'er sent someone
to buy turmeric and yellow paper.

355
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:15,750
I guessed what tricks
they were planning to play.

356
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,669
What is the turmeric for?

357
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,310
Write words on the yellow paper
with turmeric water in advance.

358
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,349
When it dries, the words will disappear.

359
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:25,710
When the ceremony begins,
the alkaline water comes out.

360
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,550
The reaction between the alkaline water
and the turmeric makes the words visible.

361
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,470
This is what's called divine decree.

362
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,669
So you decided to just go with it.

363
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:36,349
You secretly replaced
Luo Xue'er's yellow paper

364
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:39,990
imprinted with the words Ganlu Brewery.

365
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,510
You're bold and careful.

366
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,109
Just a little trick.

367
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:46,230
But it impressed me.

368
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:51,470
Anyway, thank you for your help today.
I really appreciate it.

369
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,470
Don't mention it.

370
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:55,589
However, considering you're calculating,

371
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:57,669
I think your winery will not operate
at a loss.

372
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,310
Miss Shen is truly amazing.

373
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,070
You can read the general's mind
and receive praise.

374
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,109
Could you teach me?
So I can get scolded less.

375
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,710
How would I dare to do that?

376
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,990
The general and I
share a tacit understanding, right?

377
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,550
So am I still your nemesis?

378
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,909
That day, I drank with you
under the moonlight.

379
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:17,950
I thought we had let bygones be bygones.

380
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,270
How come you still hold a grudge?

381
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:24,710
It seems it's my fault.
Fine, I'll punish myself with a drink.

382
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:31,750
Eat up.

383
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:41,288
(Danqing Winery)

384
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,429
Thank you all for your coming.

385
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:45,270
I hope you will drink my liquor

386
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,710
for gatherings and family reunions,

387
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,109
and everyone will drink heartily.

388
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,149
- Great.
- Great.

389
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:55,149
Today the winery opens.
Please drink to your heart's content.

390
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:56,429
My treat.

391
00:24:57,149 --> 00:24:59,109
Please support my younger sister.

392
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,230
Buy more in support.

393
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,510
I have a gift for you.

394
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,589
This is the dew
I collected from lotus leaves.

395
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:10,109
It can brew exceptionally sweet liquor.

396
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,109
I don't know much about liquor,
but I hope you like this gift.

397
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:14,669
Thank you.

398
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:18,909
It's your opening day.

399
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,536
As a senior in the liquor business,

400
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,128
I'm here to congratulate you.

401
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,869
I need sincere congratulations.

402
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,109
If it's insincere,
there's no need for that.

403
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,310
I am not one to be insincere.

404
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,030
You invited esteemed guests
from the industry.

405
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,990
You think they came to support you?

406
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,990
They just came to make fun of you.

407
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:46,189
Miss Xue'er, our winery opens today.

408
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:49,389
Sending white flowers?
Isn't that a bit too much?

409
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,349
Are you worried
our business will outdo yours?

410
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,310
So you are furious and flustered.

411
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,990
You really dote on your sister.

412
00:25:57,629 --> 00:26:00,030
You let an amateur challenge me?

413
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,869
Aren't you afraid of losing your money?

414
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:05,950
I warn you.
There's still time to back out now.

415
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,829
I told you. She has connections
in the liquor business.

416
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:12,470
She speaks with confidence.

417
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,030
Make way, please.

418
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:21,189
Young Master Shen, Miss Shen.

419
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,829
The general knows your store opens today
but can't make it due to his work.

420
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:26,550
He specifically asked me
to prepare a gift for you.

421
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,750
Thank him for me.

422
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,829
Please accept it, Miss Shen.

423
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:35,070
General Xu's gift?
The Shen family is impressive.

424
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,109
- Yes.
- Quite impressive.

425
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,510
- Good.
- Good.

426
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,349
- Great.
- Great.

427
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:48,310
The heavenly palace held a banquet,
and the fairy got drunk.

428
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,669
The kitchen prepares fresh delicacies,
and a grand banquet unfolds.

429
00:26:57,629 --> 00:26:59,070
- Great.
- Great.

430
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,389
- Good.
- Great.

431
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:04,550
Good couplet.

432
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,149
Good.

433
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:10,750
Why is she getting angry?

434
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:15,180
(Danqing Winery)

435
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,790
Miss Shen.

436
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,750
General, how come you're here?
Please, have a seat.

437
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,669
I'm here to give you a gift.

438
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,550
Qizi pastries?

439
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,189
Delicious. It tastes
just like when I was a child.

440
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,510
You talk sweet today.

441
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:50,389
I just learned to make Qizi pastries.

442
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:52,669
I can only say they tasted okay.

443
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,696
How can they compare
with those from your childhood?

444
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:56,589
The taste is indeed different.

445
00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:00,349
But after all, you made them,
which makes them special.

446
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,990
I also got you spiced plum juice.

447
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:08,750
Did you make this yourself?

448
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,109
It was hard enough for me
to make those Qizi pastries.

449
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,040
However, I procured the ice myself.

450
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,976
I made the ice bowl personally.

451
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:25,550
General, did you arrive late
because you spent time on these?

452
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,470
These are the best gifts
I've received today.

453
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:47,349
Why aren't you drinking?

454
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:50,310
I made it for you. Drink more.

455
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:10,470
Young Master Shen, what brings you here?

456
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,429
I sent armed escorts here
to give some food to the beggars.

457
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,950
I was passing by and wanted
to ask how your investigation is going.

458
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:21,869
Dissolving Powder and Blood Night Bloomer
are from Tang Sect

459
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,909
and Five-Poison Sect, respectively.

460
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:26,149
A long time ago,

461
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:28,829
a runaway disciple of the two sects went
to the Western Regions.

462
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:32,109
His offspring inherited
the skills of both sects.

463
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,349
It means if we focus on the disciple

464
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,149
who fled to the Western Regions,

465
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:41,270
we can trace back to find the culprit
who poisoned Danqing.

466
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,030
That's right.
I'm still investigating it.

467
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,669
Once there is a new clue,
I will immediately inform you.

468
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:54,189
This is not only related
to Danqing's poisoning.

469
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:57,149
I'm afraid
more interests involved are behind it.

470
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:01,030
It's bigger than all of us.
You must be extra careful.

471
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:03,528
(Danqing Winery)

472
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,270
Miss, are you here to buy liquor?

473
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,230
You're our first customer today
and can enjoy a discount.

474
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,869
I'm not buying anything.

475
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:18,349
Miss Lv Zhu. What brings you here then?

476
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,230
To meet someone.

477
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:20,710
To meet whom?

478
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,510
To meet you, Shen Danqing.

479
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:28,629
Me? What for?

480
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:31,710
Here.

481
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,510
I warn you to stop acting coquettishly
in front of the general.

482
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,149
Don't think just because
he made Qizi pastries for you,

483
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:42,909
you can be cocky.

484
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:48,589
You should know
I'm the woman closest to the general.

485
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:50,869
The general's closest woman.

486
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,230
Yes, you're the closest one.

487
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:58,790
I noticed it
the last time I was at his house.

488
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,470
But so what?
You need to be intimate with him.

489
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,189
Only then will the general fancies you.

490
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:10,750
Otherwise, it's just wishful thinking.

491
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,070
Don't be too smug.

492
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,510
Your words are so vulgar.

493
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,990
The general will see your true colors.

494
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,288
I spilled hot tea
all over the general last time.

495
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,829
I must say that was ruder.

496
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,909
But the general didn't mind.

497
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,070
You...

498
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,990
I run a business.
All who come are guests.

499
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:36,550
This is Zhuyeqing glutinous rice liquor
with the effect

500
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,470
of replenishing energy
and nourishing blood.

501
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,030
On the house.

502
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,589
It helps you to reduce your anger.

503
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:46,470
Consider it a good luck in business.

504
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,429
(Zhuyeqing Glutinous Rice Liquor)
Save it.

505
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,992
Anyone who doesn't take
free stuff is a fool.

506
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:58,270
Exactly. How could you be a fool?

507
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,230
Don't be too smug. Let's wait and see.

508
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:05,429
See you.

509
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:10,109
(Prince Yi's Mansion)

510
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:11,310
(Lv Zhu has mentioned Miss Shen)

511
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,070
more and more often
in her secret letters.

512
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:15,470
And there's a hint of jealousy
in her words.

513
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:18,589
I think she's been jealous
of other women and forgotten

514
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:19,349
her task completely.

515
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,750
I thought that Xu Chengfeng sent a gift
to the opening of the Danqing Winery

516
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,909
because he and Shen Zishan
were old acquaintances.

517
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:30,990
But now it seems
that may not be the case.

518
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,550
You mean...

519
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,950
Although Lv Zhu is not clever,

520
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,710
you must believe in a woman's intuition.

521
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:41,189
Since she mentioned Shen Danqing
in the secret letters,

522
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:44,869
it proves that Shen Danqing matters
to Xu Chengfeng.

523
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,510
The Shen siblings are key figures
in the royal cargo case.

524
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:49,589
Maybe Xu Chengfeng is close with them

525
00:32:50,189 --> 00:32:52,470
just to obtain information.

526
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,429
His Highness,
Xu Chengfeng is hard to deal with.

527
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,149
Why not start with the Shen family
for a breakthrough?

528
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,389
Yes. Send people to keep a close watch
on the Shen family.

529
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:03,848
Yes.

530
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,536
(Pavilion)

531
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,472
(Danqing Winery)

532
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:16,429
(Today's specialty, Rose Liquor)

533
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:17,589
You've bought the Rose Liquor?

534
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:19,869
Yeah, I failed to buy it twice in a row.

535
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:21,310
This time I finally got it.

536
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:25,189
I heard it was brewed with spring water.
Tastes good, not strong or spicy.

537
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:27,990
After drinking it, you get a mouthful
of a lingering fragrance.

538
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,829
I must have a taste at home tonight.

539
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:30,950
Okay, I'm gonna buy the liquor.

540
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:37,928
(Rose Liquor, Sold Out)

541
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:54,792
Say it.

542
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:58,550
Miss Xue'er,
since Danqing Winery opened,

543
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,149
we haven't sold much liquor.

544
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:03,030
We've lost money for half a month.

545
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:11,229
I underestimated you. Well played.

546
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:21,589
The Rose Liquor is extraordinary.

547
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,109
Yeah, I bought two bottles.

548
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,189
After drinking it,
I can't forget it even now.

549
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,288
Sir, what's wrong with you?

550
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,589
- My stomach hurts.
- Sir.

551
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:37,589
Someone! Hurry.

552
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:38,589
My stomach hurts too much.

553
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:41,229
Sir, what's wrong with you?
I can get a doctor for you.

554
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:44,430
I just drank this Rose Liquor
and suddenly felt a pain in my belly.

555
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,149
There's something wrong
with this liquor.

556
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,749
Other customers drank this
and were fine.

557
00:34:50,749 --> 00:34:52,328
Sir, you can't talk nonsense
without evidence.

558
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,870
I drank this
on an empty stomach this morning.

559
00:34:56,669 --> 00:34:58,109
There's something wrong
with this liquor.

560
00:34:58,109 --> 00:34:59,430
We can't drink this.

561
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,070
Look, the liquor is going wrong.

562
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,510
I need a refund.

563
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,789
Everyone, be quiet.

564
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:10,589
Miss.

565
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,990
What's going on?

566
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,550
He said our liquor upset his stomach.
He wants a refund.

567
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,830
- A refund.
- A refund.

568
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,510
Guys, I am the owner of Danqing Winery.

569
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,149
I promise that if you're dissatisfied,
you can return it at any time.

570
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:30,309
Please stay calm.
We refund you one by one.

571
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,910
Good.

572
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,030
It hurts.

573
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,030
Get Mr. Miao here.

574
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:38,568
Yes.

575
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,109
His pulse shows no abnormalities.

576
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,430
(He is indeed faking it.)

577
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:03,550
He's in sharp pain.
Please examine him thoroughly.

578
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,470
What is this for?

579
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,589
Acupuncture treatment.

580
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:22,030
You have unbearable abdominal pain.
A foreign object blocks your intestines.

581
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,789
I'll use this needle to puncture
into the intestines to reach the object.

582
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:29,309
Then use a scalpel for bloodletting
to allow the object to be expelled.

583
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:31,030
Sir, do not back off.

584
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,550
If not treated in time,
you'll be in danger.

585
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:40,269
Wait. I feel better now. I'm fine.

586
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,789
You need treatment.

587
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:45,229
Sir, you should get treatment
lest it recurs.

588
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:46,189
Quick. Lie down.

589
00:36:46,952 --> 00:36:47,629
Be treated promptly.

590
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:48,830
Let the doctor treat you.

591
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,830
I'm fine. I was actually joking.

592
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,430
Joking? How could you?

593
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,789
Well, there's nothing wrong
with the liquor.

594
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,749
Make way.

595
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:08,109
As you see, someone sent this young man
to cause trouble.

596
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:10,109
The liquor is good. You can buy it.

597
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:11,990
A false alarm.

598
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,470
Sorry about that.

599
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,510
- I just got a refund.
- Sorry.

600
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,109
- I have to buy it again.
- Sorry about that.

601
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:23,070
It seems someone is playing tricks.
Could it be Luo Xue'er?

602
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:25,870
Who else could it be, if not her?

603
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:28,189
It appears
Luo Xue'er is in a desperate bind.

604
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,470
We need to be alert.
She might play more tricks.

605
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,070
Yes.

606
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,470
As you ordered, I went
to Danqing Winery to cause trouble.

607
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,669
But Shen Danqing is cunning and hateful.
She forced me to do the acupuncture.

608
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:49,789
I had no choice, so...

609
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,870
Do not mention this to anyone. Get out.

610
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,870
Thank you, Miss.

611
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:10,789
Miss.

612
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,510
Did you blow your cover while doing it?

613
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,990
Rest assured, I was wearing a beard.

614
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,669
I blended in during the chaos,
and no one noticed me.

615
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,350
Look, this is the secret recipe
for brewing Rose Liquor.

616
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:26,568
(Rose Liquor Secret Recipe)

617
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:29,550
You're truly wise.

618
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,269
They would never expect

619
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:35,669
that we were there not for a scam
but for this secret recipe.

620
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,789
As per your instructions,
when that young man was causing trouble,

621
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:42,910
(I caused chaos
to make the situation uncontrollable.)

622
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,789
(So their armed escorts in the backyard)

623
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:48,149
(had to go to the front
to maintain order.)

624
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:50,149
(I took the opportunity
to look for this secret recipe.)

625
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,709
As you said, their unskilled brewers

626
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:57,030
were all stout armed escorts.

627
00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:01,030
They must have kept the written recipe
in the warehouse.

628
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,470
(Rose Liquor Secret Recipe)
(I saw a box with the recipe inside.)

629
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,229
I figured out the trick and obtained it.

630
00:39:08,669 --> 00:39:09,990
Well done.

631
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,669
Thank you, Miss.

632
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:13,830
Instruct them to follow this recipe.

633
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,390
Let our brewers
give it a try right away.

634
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,104
