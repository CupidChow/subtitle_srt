00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:23,442
(Xuanyi Pharmacy)
Physician Li.

4
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:25,362
My little brother
hasn't eaten in three days.

5
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:26,203
Please!

6
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:28,162
You owe me dozens of taels.

7
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:28,802
No!

8
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:29,362
Physician Li.

9
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:30,642
Physician Li, please.

10
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:31,323
I beg you.

11
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:32,162
Go away.

12
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,563
- I can't do this anymore.
- I'll pay.

13
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:40,323
Save her brother.

14
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,323
Thank you.

15
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:42,642
- Thank you, Miss Shen.
- Alright.

16
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:48,603
Find me at Shen Residence

17
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:49,563
if you need more money.

18
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:52,362
Miss Shen.

19
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:54,642
My brother would have died

20
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,923
without your help today.

21
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:58,683
Miss Shen.

22
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:00,882
The Luo family kicked me out.

23
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:02,563
If you don't mind it,

24
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,442
please take me in.

25
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:07,323
I swear I will
work myself to the bone for you.

26
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:14,003
Since they kicked you out,

27
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,962
come home with me.

28
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:18,283
Thank you, Miss Shen.

29
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:22,802
(Shen Mansion)

30
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:23,763
(Wait here for now.)

31
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,283
I'll have someone
clean up a room for you.

32
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:28,082
Thank you, Miss Shen.

33
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:44,682
Greetings, Young Master Shen.

34
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:47,122
You betrayed the Luo family.

35
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:48,562
There's no guarantee that

36
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:49,723
you won't betray us one day.

37
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:51,443
I will never

38
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,122
allow anyone to hurt Danqing.

39
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:55,763
Young Master Shen.

40
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:58,242
Are you going to drive me away?

41
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,323
I'm just taking measures to make sure

42
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,362
that you won't ever do us harm.

43
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:06,082
It's our exclusive Bone Erosion Pill.

44
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:07,242
Whoever takes this

45
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:09,802
must take the antidote every month.

46
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:11,362
Otherwise, they will

47
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:13,003
die from rotting bones in a year.

48
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:14,842
Only I have the antidote.

49
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,163
But rest assured.

50
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:18,163
Remain loyal to Danqing and you will

51
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:20,443
get the antidote every month.

52
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:23,043
So,

53
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:25,483
as long as I take this pill,

54
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:26,923
you will trust me.

55
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:29,003
The decision is yours.

56
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:38,323
Wait.

57
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:47,763
Zishan.

58
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:49,122
I know why you're worried.

59
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:50,923
But I don't

60
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,642
want her to be a loyal servant

61
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:54,242
because she has no choice.

62
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,923
Can I vouch for her?

63
00:03:58,242 --> 00:03:59,323
Give her a chance

64
00:03:59,763 --> 00:04:01,362
to prove her loyalty without the pill.

65
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:03,203
You trust her so much?

66
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:04,962
Don't doubt those who work for you.

67
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:06,562
If I doubt

68
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:07,682
my own people,

69
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:09,003
how am I different

70
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,283
from the Luo family?

71
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:14,603
Fine.

72
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:17,043
Since Danqing has vouched for you,

73
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:18,723
forget about the pill.

74
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:22,483
Thank you, Zishan.

75
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:25,843
Shuixian,

76
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:27,963
as long as you serve me wholeheartedly,

77
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:30,283
I will share weal and woe

78
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,603
with you.

79
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:36,603
Miss,

80
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:38,043
I swear I won't

81
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,963
let you down in my lifetime.

82
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:48,168
General.

83
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:49,963
Do you believe what the bandit said?

84
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:52,762
He can lie,

85
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:54,202
but the evidence can't.

86
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:57,083
The lock does look like

87
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,682
it's corroded by chemicals.

88
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:00,322
Tianhao,

89
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:02,523
find out what chemical it is.

90
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,163
Then follow this lead and ask about

91
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:05,682
in the black market.

92
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:06,483
Understood.

93
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:11,483
Right, General.

94
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:12,882
I got the cream back.

95
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:13,723
Here.

96
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:15,562
Good.

97
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:16,283
Well,

98
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,643
take it to Miss Shen right away.

99
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:21,442
Me?

100
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:23,322
You want me to go?

101
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,643
No, General.

102
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,083
You've caused her so much trouble.

103
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:29,442
You threw her into the river

104
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:30,723
and got her injured.

105
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:31,603
You should go.

106
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:32,362
- No way.
- Try

107
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:33,523
to ease the tension

108
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:34,643
so that she stops

109
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:35,923
showing veiled hostility.

110
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:38,442
Besides, judging from her temperament,

111
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:40,442
I can't manage it if she loses it.

112
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:42,963
I'm going back to work.

113
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,283
Tianhao, where are you going?

114
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:47,122
This is part of your job.

115
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:55,202
So I have to go in person.

116
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:26,043
Miss, General Xu is here.

117
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:32,122
You may leave.

118
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,442
Sorry I've disturbed

119
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,163
your leisurely moment.

120
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:47,843
It's just to pass the time.

121
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:49,002
Shuixian.

122
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:50,562
Bring some tea.

123
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:51,643
Understood.

124
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,562
What brings you here,

125
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:56,923
General?

126
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:02,283
Is your foot getting better?

127
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:04,523
You assisted in the arrest

128
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:05,963
but I got you injured.

129
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,002
I feel uneasy about it

130
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:13,603
and brought some cream

131
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:15,283
bestowed by His Majesty.

132
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,562
It's highly effective.

133
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:21,603
What's that face?

134
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,923
You came just to

135
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,923
deliver this wound-healing cream?

136
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:34,163
Mmm.

137
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:40,643
That was unexpected.

138
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:42,762
You've been giving me a hard time

139
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,723
as if I was a suspect.

140
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,523
Are you clearing my name now?

141
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,202
Then,

142
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:51,202
I shall appreciate it.

143
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:54,242
You can say that.

144
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:55,603
But to be precise,

145
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,283
you haven't cleared your name fully.

146
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:01,283
How so?

147
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:03,322
I thought those bandits

148
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,523
all died while resisting capture

149
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:07,202
and we only retrieved the cargo.

150
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:09,242
But to my surprise,

151
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:10,723
one of those bandits

152
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:12,802
actually survived.

153
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,603
However, it's really strange.

154
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,242
The bandit who survived

155
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:19,002
confessed to everything

156
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,083
except for the robbery
of the Luo family's

157
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,603
grain cart.

158
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:25,843
Miss Shen,

159
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:27,442
who do you think robbed

160
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:28,442
the Luo family?

161
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,802
Your exquisite brushwork

162
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,682
shows your talent.

163
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:48,442
What do you want?

164
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:49,883
Just spit it out.

165
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:51,163
I don't

166
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,763
necessarily suspect you.

167
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:54,363
How about this?

168
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:56,442
Why don't you do me a favor?

169
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,243
You're a great painter.

170
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,842
I hope you can portray that bandit

171
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:02,562
based on my description

172
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:05,602
so that I can find her
as soon as possible.

173
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:08,442
General,

174
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,243
you really overestimate me.

175
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,523
I do know a bit about painting,

176
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:14,962
but I can't

177
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:16,682
depict someone I've never seen before.

178
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:19,442
Moreover, this concerns a bandit.

179
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:22,602
If the drawing is wrong
and you arrest the wrong person,

180
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,243
I can't bear

181
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:27,163
the responsibility.

182
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,082
Rest assured, Miss Shen.

183
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,442
I remember all the details
of the appearance

184
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:35,523
and physique of that female bandit.

185
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:38,163
Should there be any discrepancies,

186
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:40,363
I will be able to correct them.

187
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:43,123
But maybe, Miss Shen,

188
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:45,163
you're scared.

189
00:09:59,442 --> 00:09:59,962
Go ahead.

190
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:03,842
This female bandit

191
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,643
wears a black short top with a red belt

192
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:07,923
and stands upright.

193
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,643
She's quite young.

194
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:16,043
She's not short.

195
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:17,562
I think

196
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:20,243
she's about your height.

197
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,363
(She has a topknot bun on her head)

198
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,283
with no ornaments.

199
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:33,962
What a coincidence.

200
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,842
It's highly similar to the hairstyle

201
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:38,163
you are wearing now.

202
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:46,202
Although she was wearing a mask,

203
00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:48,842
(I could see her bright)

204
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:50,523
(and sharp eyes.)

205
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:13,442
Like this?

206
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:17,523

All clues point to you

216
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,682
and you've had a dispute with the Luos.

217
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:03,123
I have to suspect it.

218
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,243
I don't believe

00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:07,003
in coincidences.

Forget it. General Xu
has urgent matters to attend to.

226
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:33,682
Walk him out.

227
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:35,043
Understood.

228
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:36,523
General.

229
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,442
This way.

230
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:42,322
Wait.

231
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:47,163
You didn't mean to give me the cream.

232
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:48,962
I don't want it even if

233
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:50,682
it was bestowed.

234
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:53,682
Take it away.

235
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:55,962
Shuixian.

236
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:56,682
Yes.

237
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:57,482
Help me up.

238
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:17,163
I did come to deliver the cream.

You're back.

240
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,123
I'll make some tea for you.

241
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:43,163
You didn't feel like

242
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:45,442
giving away the cream
or did you get a new bottle?

243
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,722
Are you happy being sarcastic?

244
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:52,923
Miss Shen is really something.

245
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:54,442
She won't let you off the hook.

246
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:57,043
Sorry about that.

247
00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:58,043
Let's talk business.

248
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:00,322
I've consulted the pharmacists.

249
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,562
The chemical that can corrode a lock

250
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:03,643
is Dissolving Powder.

251
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,482
Only an expert in this field

252
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:06,283
could produce it.

253
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:08,643
But we asked around and found nothing.

254
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:12,202
Even we can't find this person.

255
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:14,682
They must have hidden their tracks.

256
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,003
Tianhao.

257
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,562
The black market
is the local information hub.

258
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,562
The leader is called Know-it-all.

259
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,523
Find this person

260
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,842
to ask if any skilled burglars
who are good at

261
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,442
making poison

262
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:28,283
were in Liao City a few months ago.

263
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,562
But Know-it-all
is secretive in his dealings.

264
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:32,363
No one knows what he looks like.

265
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:33,202
How do we find him?

266
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:37,003
Let's find out about it
in the black market.

267
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:37,736
Okay.

268
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:38,602
I'll get ready.

269
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:39,722
Mmm.

270
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:54,003
(I should have asked Tianhao
to deliver it.)

271
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:03,562
(Shuixian grew up serving Ms. Zhou.)

272
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:05,763
(She must know some dirty secrets.)

273
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:08,163
(I can make a big deal out of it.)

274
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,243
(Shuixian.)

275
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,202
Ms. Zhou spoils her daughter.

276
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:15,082
And Luo Shuangshuang is overbearing.

277
00:15:15,842 --> 00:15:17,442
You've served them for years.

278
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,763
Have you noticed anything suspicious?

279
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:25,562
Miss.

280
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:26,962
There is something.

281
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:29,523
The rumor among the servants

282
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,043
says that Luo Shuangshuang
is Luo Jizhou's daughter.

283
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:33,923
Madam Zhou doesn't seem

284
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:35,123
to be refuting that.

285
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:36,243
However,

286
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,442
there is something weird about it.

287
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,883
Xue'er, you're so thoughtful.

288
00:15:44,363 --> 00:15:46,962
If only Shuangshuang
could be as sensible as you.

289
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:48,442
She wanted to come today.

290
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,602
But she has been researching

291
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:52,202
remedies to lose weight.

292
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:55,003
She applied
snake venom powder while fasting.

293
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:57,802
Her face finally stopped swelling up.

294
00:15:57,802 --> 00:15:59,163
But her body is swollen.

295
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:00,602
So she didn't come.

296
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:01,923
All this fuss for nothing.

297
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:03,562
Your sister was born early

298
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,442
at seven months of gestation.

299
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:08,163
Naturally, she needs extra nutrition.

300
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:09,802
It's good to be chubby.

301
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:10,442
Mmm.

302
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:12,123
(Ms. Zhou said herself)

303
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:14,003
that Luo Shuangshuang was a preemie

304
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:16,442
who was born three months early.

305
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:20,283
She was born
on the fifth day of the tenth month.

306
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:21,482
Therefore,

307
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:24,082
Madam Zhou must have gotten pregnant

308
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:25,243
in the third month.

309
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:28,883
But I later heard
an old servant mention that

310
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,283
Luo Jizhou had been

311
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,442
purchasing rice in Yangzhou

312
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:35,243
that entire month
due to the severe drought.

313
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:40,602
That is to say,

314
00:16:41,923 --> 00:16:43,163
Luo Shuangshuang is not

315
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:44,602
Luo Jizhou's daughter.

316
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,722
But he has no idea about it

317
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:52,442
and has been indulging
Madam Zhou and Luo Shuangshuang.

318
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:54,883
(So Ms. Zhou told)

319
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,722
(Luo Jizhou that Luo Shuangshuang)

320
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,602
(was his daughter in desperation
at the ancestral hall)

321
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:01,883
(just to turn him against me.)

322
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:03,643
(But now,)

323
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,482
(I must make good use of it.)

324
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:09,482
Shuixian.

325
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:11,002
Tomorrow,

326
00:17:11,603 --> 00:17:12,762
come with me somewhere.

327
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:13,992
Hmm.

328
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:28,962
Miss, what are we doing here?

329
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:31,603
These beggars have a crazy look
out of starvation.

330
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:32,962
It's creepy.

331
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:36,442
You heard

332
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:38,563
that Luo Shuangshuang
was a premature baby,

333
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:40,202
but it's just hearsay.

334
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:41,442
I've looked into it.

335
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:44,242
The midwife Ms. Li
who delivered Luo lives here.

336
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:45,643
Once we find her,

337
00:17:46,202 --> 00:17:48,042
we can prove that Luo Shuangshuang

338
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,042
was a preemie.

339
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:50,163
Add firewood.

340
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:53,323
Granny.

341
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:53,832
Add firewood.

342
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,242
Excuse me, do you know Ms. Li?

343
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:00,442
Do you know Ms. Li?

344
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:02,643
If so, could you show us the way?

345
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:03,603
I...

346
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,482
Do you know her or not?

347
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,363
Forget it, let's ask around elsewhere.

348
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,563
Five taels of silver
to show you the way.

349
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,522
Ten taels of silver to keep you safe.

350
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:21,323
Keep us safe?

351
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,163
What do you mean?

352
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,722
Miss, didn't you notice?

353
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:26,522
The beggars here are in gangs.

354
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:28,083
You look very rich

355
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,722
at first glance.

356
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:31,242
You think they'll let you go?

357
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:35,083
How are you going to protect us?

358
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:37,323
I make a living in this black market.

359
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:38,803
I have my ways.

360
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:41,482
Follow me if you believe me.

361
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:43,722
Otherwise, get on your way.

362
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:45,042
I have to cook.

363
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:50,762
Granny.

364
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,083
Can you slow down a bit?

365
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:00,923
Okay.

366
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:03,803
Ms. Li's son must be

367
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:05,123
twenty-seven or eight.

368
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:06,962
Ms. Li is known for gambling.

369
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,202
What about her son?

370
00:19:08,962 --> 00:19:10,482
Why is he living here with her?

371
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:12,643
Like mother, like son.

372
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,323
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

373
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:16,883
What's so strange about that?

374
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:18,722
You're not taking us to see Ms. Li.

375
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:22,682
What are you talking about?

376
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:23,803
Hurry up.

377
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:25,803
Her home is right ahead.

378
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:26,482
Come on.

379
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,083
Ms. Li has no children.

380
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:30,442
But you went along
and talked about her "son".

381
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:35,083
You're not completely foolish.

382
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:36,883
Miss, let's go.

383
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:39,242
It's too late. She's with those beggars.

384
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:43,803
Kids,

385
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:45,722
get them!

386
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:54,123
Miss.

387
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:05,800
- Run! Ambush.
- Miss, are you alright?

388
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,563
- I'm fine.
- Stop.

389
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:08,442
What a coincidence, Miss Shen.
It's you again.

390
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:10,682
Thank you, General.

391
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:11,803
What are you doing here?

392
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,282
Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?

393
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:17,643
Won't you help him?

394
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:19,363
Tianhao can

395
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:20,883
handle them easily.

396
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,803
I'll take my leave
if there's nothing else.

397
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:26,202
Thank you, General.

398
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:27,442
Shuixian, let's go.

399
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:28,883
Miss Shen,

400
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:30,323
I saved your life.

401
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:31,682
And all I get

402
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:33,083
is a thank you?

403
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,522
What do you want me to do then?

404
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:36,843
Should I

405
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:39,843
offer to be your wife?

406
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,843
I don't think so.

407
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:46,282
I will take my leave.

408
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:52,603
You wouldn't let me go.

409
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:54,363
Aren't you behaving frivolously?

410
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:55,883
(Tianhao is right.)

411
00:20:56,202 --> 00:20:57,482
(She's showing veiled hostility.)

412
00:20:58,482 --> 00:20:59,843
You were the one

413
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,643
who talked about being my wife.

414
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,442
Were you acting composed?

415
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,042
What do you want?

416
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:10,083
Answer one question.

417
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:11,762
And you may leave.

418
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,002
Alright, go ahead.

419
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:18,883
Is your foot

420
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:20,163
any better?

421
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:24,680
Mmm.

422
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,083
It's almost healed.

423
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:35,883
Here.

424
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:37,762
This time,

425
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,482
I mean it.

426
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:44,083
Thank you, General.

427
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:55,083
Do you really think I'm frivolous?

428
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:56,522
That's the second question.

429
00:21:58,682 --> 00:21:59,522
Miss Shen.

430
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:05,042
General.

431
00:22:05,563 --> 00:22:08,083
I was fighting fiercely,
risking my life.

432
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,442
And here you are, bantering with her.

433
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:13,123
You have one chance to rephrase it.

434
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:15,962
You did well by giving her the cream

435
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:17,563
like a tough guy.

436
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:18,682
That's more like it.

437
00:22:19,563 --> 00:22:21,123
Did you capture the woman
who was leading

438
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:21,803
the beggars?

439
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:22,722
Yeah.

440
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,363
Take her back.

441
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:27,762
So she is...

442
00:22:28,002 --> 00:22:28,584
That's right.

443
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:32,202
She is our Know-it-all.

444
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,363
Miss, let's hurry back home.

445
00:22:36,762 --> 00:22:38,242
This place is terrifying.

446
00:22:38,762 --> 00:22:41,762
We can always
ask Young Master to investigate.

447
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,722
It wasn't easy coming here
and they almost got us.

448
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:46,163
It's a pity if we go back

449
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:47,202
empty-handed.

450
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:49,163
You have an idea, Miss?

451
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:55,803
If I'm not mistaken,

452
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:57,962
you know Ms. Li.

453
00:22:57,962 --> 00:22:59,603
You even know where she lives.

454
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:02,042
How... How do you know that?

455
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:03,762
When I was asking for directions,

456
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:05,083
you clearly had

457
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,962
something to say but couldn't speak.

458
00:23:07,682 --> 00:23:09,442
Feel free to speak up now.

459
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:10,923
I'll pay you handsomely.

460
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:13,803
That's right, Ms. Li is my aunt.

461
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:15,643
But, you've come too late.

462
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:17,202
The family she worked for

463
00:23:17,202 --> 00:23:18,363
has taken her away

464
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,682
to enjoy her retirement.

465
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:22,123
What? Who took her away?

466
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:23,202
It seems that

467
00:23:23,843 --> 00:23:25,123
the Luo family beat us to it.

468
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:29,480
(Luo Residence)

469
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:31,282
Mother, you're truly thoughtful.

470
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:33,442
You asked me to
bring Ms. Li here lest she spill

471
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:34,603
our secret.

472
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:38,482
Shuixian was my maid.

473
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,923
But now she is with Shen Danqing.

474
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:42,042
That's a real trouble.

475
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:44,002
Shen Danqing is greedy and cunning.

476
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:45,522
You know how she blackmailed us.

477
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:46,762
Rest assured.

478
00:23:47,123 --> 00:23:49,202
I will take care of Ms. Li.

479
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:51,323
No one should know about this.

480
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:52,363
Especially not your uncle.

481
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:54,002
Sometimes,

482
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:57,202
lies serve us better than the truth.

483
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,682
Mmm.

484
00:23:58,682 --> 00:24:00,482
Only we three are a family.

485
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:02,643
Yes, Mother.

486
00:24:03,002 --> 00:24:05,002
Madam, Ms. Li is here.

487
00:24:06,002 --> 00:24:06,643
Come in.

488
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,002
Madam.

489
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:12,962
I haven't seen you for about 20 years.

490
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:15,242
How come you look even younger?

491
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:18,323
Are you happy with the residence?

492
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,843
Totally.

493
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:20,722
I don't even know

494
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:22,522
how to repay you.

495
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:24,803
There's an opportunity
to show your gratitude.

496
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:27,042
It's Shuangshuang's birthday today.

497
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:28,803
Do you remember
what I've told you to say?

498
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,083
Say it properly later.

499
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,442
Rest assured, Madam.

500
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:37,002
I wish Miss Shuangshuang
a happy birthday.

501
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:39,722
Miss Shuangshuang
has grown even prettier

502
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:41,002
after all these years.

503
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:43,083
Back then, she was chubby
like a bread dough

504
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,522
because she was born after the due date.

505
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:47,522
Shuangshuang

506
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:49,643
really gave me a hard time.

507
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:51,482
It was due date,

508
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:54,163
but she just wouldn't come out.

509
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:56,442
Mother, I love to cling to you.

510
00:24:58,962 --> 00:25:01,363
Let me toast to you
on behalf of Shuangshuang.

511
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:04,883
Her birthday is the day you suffered.

512
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:06,522
You've worked hard.

513
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:14,923
It's not enough
to just toast on my behalf.

514
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:17,123
What birthday gift did you bring?

515
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:21,242
I forgot about it.

516
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:22,803
How could you forget?

517
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:25,083
I told you that I fancy

518
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,962
the set of jewelry from Jinbao Jewelry.

519
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:28,603
How can I forget

520
00:25:28,603 --> 00:25:30,002
what you've said?

521
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:33,042
I asked the shopkeeper of Jinbao Jewelry

522
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:34,603
to handcraft

523
00:25:34,722 --> 00:25:35,883
a set of jewelry for you.

524
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:38,242
It's even pricier and prettier

525
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:39,682
than the set you wanted.

526
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:43,843
Leave it down.

527
00:25:46,843 --> 00:25:48,042
Thank you, Uncle.

528
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:51,883
It's indeed dazzling
and suits my sister well.

529
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:55,083
Master Jizhou, Madam Zhou.

530
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:57,123
A fortune-teller at the door

531
00:25:57,202 --> 00:25:59,002
insists on wishing Miss Shuangshuang
a happy birthday.

532
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:02,042
Do you know any fortune-tellers?

533
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,482
Is he from the dilapidated temple
in the suburbs?

534
00:26:06,002 --> 00:26:07,603
He has read my fortune before,

535
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:09,603
saying I would marry
a desirable gentleman.

536
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:13,563
I bet he wants to say
a few nice words to get a reward.

537
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:15,643
Bring him in.

538
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:16,323
Yes.

539
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:24,002
(Fortune is as unpredictable
as the weather.)

540
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:26,242
Every day may bring fortune or calamity.

541
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:28,923
Guide the gentlemen
who have lost their way.

542
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:33,962
Awaken the long-asleep heroes.

543
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:50,323
How strange.

544
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:56,202
Sir, what is going on?

545
00:26:56,603 --> 00:27:00,202
This copper bell
is an effective ritual implement.

546
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:02,442
It rings when it approaches someone

547
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,522
whose fate is about to change.

548
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:09,123
Master Jizhou, I fear you may
encounter a bloody disaster today.

549
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:15,123
Uncle, don't believe in
these superstitions.

550
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:16,762
We're well-established.

551
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,563
How can we run into trouble
without reason?

552
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:21,163
I never speak falsehoods.

553
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:23,083
Look at this gentleman.

554
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:26,282
Does he not look displeased
with a darkened forehead?

555
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:28,042
This is a presage of misfortune.

556
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:30,042
Nonsense.

557
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:33,843
It's broken.

558
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:38,442
A broken jade foreshadows a dark future.

559
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:41,202
Destined to clash.

560
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,002
Destined to clash.

561
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,123
You always favor Miss Shuangshuang.

562
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,762
But she was born
at seven months of gestation.

563
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:49,762
She was born

564
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:51,363
with a misfortune as a jinx.

565
00:27:52,202 --> 00:27:54,242
She is born to restrain you.

566
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:55,603
Watch your mouth.

567
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,442
It's my birthday today.

568
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,722
Yet you call me a jinx.

569
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:01,883
Sir, could it be that
you have miscalculated?

570
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:04,722
Shuangshuang was born
after the due date.

571
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:06,843
Utter nonsense.

572
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:07,803
Master Jizhou,

573
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:10,442
don't listen to such nonsense.

574
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,002
I'm Shuangshuang's mother.

575
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:13,923
And the midwife Ms. Li is also here.

576
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,242
Do we not know

577
00:28:15,323 --> 00:28:16,762
when Shuangshuang was born?

578
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:17,442
Right.

579
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:19,843
Miss Shuangshuang
was born after the due date.

580
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,123
It is absolutely true.

581
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:22,603
How dare this madman

582
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:24,242
spout nonsense on such a happy day?

583
00:28:24,563 --> 00:28:26,522
Someone, drag him out!

584
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:29,448
No.

585
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:33,363
Desire gives rise to confusion.
Evil stems from audacity.

586
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:36,803
A timely awakening
means salvation, Master.

587
00:28:36,803 --> 00:28:38,803
A timely awakening means salvation.

588
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:41,123
Mother, it's broken.

589
00:28:41,123 --> 00:28:43,042
It's okay. I will buy you a new one.

590
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:48,563
M-Miss.

591
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:50,442
I said exactly

592
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,363
what you told me to say.

593
00:28:53,123 --> 00:28:54,682
The money you promised...

594
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:57,323
Sir.

595
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:00,883
Take this money and start a business.

596
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:02,923
Thank you, Miss.

597
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:09,643
Miss.

598
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:12,323
You sent the fortune-teller
to stage that play

599
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:14,123
to tell Luo Jizhou that

600
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:15,643
Luo Shuangshuang was a preemie?

601
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:17,522
It's Luo Shuangshuang's birthday.

602
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,762
Of course, I have to give her a present.

603
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,282
Luo Jizhou is highly superstitious.

604
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:25,522
He would listen to no one
but a fortune-teller.

605
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:28,603
I have planted a seed

606
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,923
of doubt in him.

607
00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:32,002
Next,

608
00:29:32,442 --> 00:29:34,083
let's wait for the flower to bloom.

609
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:37,242
(Uncle.)

610
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:42,442
Father, what's wrong?

611
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:48,282
I sent the broken jade hairpin
to be fixed.

612
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:51,843
Do you like my gifts?

613
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:54,803
I love them.

614
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:56,923
Good to know.

615
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:59,002
Have a cup of tea with me.

616
00:29:59,123 --> 00:29:59,688
Okay.

617
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:08,042
Father, here.

618
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:16,603
I'm so useless, alas...

619
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:20,163
You're bleeding.

620
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:21,603
Come on.

621
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:22,323
Let me see.

622
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:22,856
It hurts.

623
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:25,242
You're not a physician.

624
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:27,482
It's a deep cut. I need to dress it.
