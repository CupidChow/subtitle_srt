PRESIDENT CHUN TODAY

5
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>To celebrate New Year, President Chun
visited police headquarters today</i>

6
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:59,726
<i>to award medals to officers
who apprehended North Korean spies.</i>

7
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>The President expressed concerns
about the recent resurgence of</i>

8
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,359
<i>anti-state movements
instigated by radical left subversives</i>

9
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,906
<i>as they have been making
a violent movement to destroy</i>

10
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:17,702
<i>Korea's liberal-democratic system
by communicating with North Korean spies.</i>

11
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,123
<i>Also, the President emphasized
the importance of</i>

12
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,836
<i>protecting social order
and national security.</i>

13
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,549

DR. OH YUN-SANG
PHYSICIAN AT CHUNGANG HOSPITAL

23
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,988
He's dead.

24
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,866
Bring him back.

25
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,535
Give me a cardiotonic.

26
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,972
-Start the engine.
-Yes, sir.

27
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,733
Sir, we have a situation.

28
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,504
Director is on his way.

29
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,676
He can't be resuscitated.

30
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,514
Move the body.

31
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,808
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,310
Hold it properly!

33
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
Eradicate communism!

34
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,207
Damn it. Come on!

35
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,935
-Who called the doctor?
-I did, sir.

36
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,980
He was just a testifier, so…

37
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,440
Without reporting first?

38
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,819
You made a witness. Do you know that?

39
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,570
What are you going to do about this?

40
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,536
There is no need to fuss over nothing.

41
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,622
Go have lunch.

42
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,918
Attention!

43
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,129
Eradicate communism!

44
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,722
What should we do with the body?

45
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,933
Burn it.

46
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,521
As you command, sir.

47
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,954
Welcome.

48
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,539
Attention! Salute!

49
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,790
Eradicate communism!

50
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,918
Congratulations, Director.

51
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,255
I'm sorry I missed the ceremony.

00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,550
DIRECTOR JANG, HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
PRESIDENT'S RIGHT-HAND MAN

53
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,805
The President wanted to give this
to you in person, but…

54
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,891
It's an honor either way.

55
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,021
What have you got for me?

56
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,777
Kim Jung-nam?

57
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,446
He's the one behind a series of
recent communist activities

58
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,784
including the Incheon riots and
the disclosure of journalism guidelines.

59
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,245
He doesn't hold rank or have a title.

60
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,209
He wrote the decree for democratization

61
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,880
issued by the opposition leaders,
Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung.

62
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,928
You want to bring all of them
in a single package?

63
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,514
If I can prove that
they are supporters of Kim Il Sung,

64
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,142
we can wipe out those challenging
the reinstatement

65
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,645
of the President.

66
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,358
You sure live up to your reputation.

67
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,611
The master of the Blue House may
come and go, but you remain strong.

68
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,947
This man needs to be apprehended

69
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,867
before the new university semester.

70
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,868
Of course.

PROSECUTOR CHOI
SEOUL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

72
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:07,677
You said 5:00 p.m. before!
Are you messing with me?

73
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,053
I don't remember.

74
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,681
I can't even remember
what I had for lunch.

75
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,353
Look at you, filling the sacred
soju bottles with gasoline…

76
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,564
-It's not gasoline.
-What is it, then?

77
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,773
It's paint thinner.

78
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,651
Don't get smart with me.

79
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,194
-Food delivery.
-In there.

80
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,196
What else am I supposed to call it?

81
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,199
You son of a bitch!

82
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,869
Having fun hanging out here?

83
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,955
Your parents must be so damn proud of you.

84
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,206
You little shit.

85
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,752
I'm screwed whatever I say.

86
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,765
Oh, no!

87
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,977
You shouldn't be eating that crap.

88
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,687
What brings you here at this hour?

89
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,607
Come with us.
I'll treat you to a proper dinner.

90
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,861
Sounds like an idea. Where are we going?

91
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,988
Can you sign this for us?

92
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:11,824
Here.

93
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,162
I knew there is no such thing
as a free drink.

94
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,373
Using dirty tricks on me now?

95
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,460
Come on, Prosecutor.

96
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,963
Park Jong-chul, Seoul National University.

97
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,591
Died of a heart attack? A 22-year-old?

98
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,968
He needs to be cremated tonight.

99
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,183
I'll get going.

100
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,853
Do stay and enjoy the rest of the night.

101
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,731
You deserve some downtime.

102
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,820
By the way, there won't be any problems
with that dead college kid, right?

103
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,155
Sure.

104
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,157
It's being taken care of.

105
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,540
AUTHORIZATION FOR CREMATION

106
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,510
He's been dead for less than eight hours.
Has the family seen the body?

107
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,348
They haven't, have they?

108
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,685
We obtained consent from his father
at the Busan Police Station.

109
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,105
Who would agree to
to have his son cremated

110
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,440
without even seeing the body?

111
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,486
Who are you trying to kid?
Does this make sense to you?

112
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,155
This is Anti-communist matter.
Just sign it.

113
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,493
Don't fucking tell me what to do.
Take the paper and get out.

114
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,877
Come on, cut us some slack.

115
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,133
Just sign the paper
and let's get out of here.

116
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,428
-All expenses paid.
-Listen.

117
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,682
This is so sloppy
that you're making me blush.

118
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,978
You need an autopsy
before burial or cremation.

119
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,313
That's the law.

120
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,898
Yes, we know that.

121
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,695
But the powers-that-be
want this wrapped up by morning.

122
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,826
What?

123
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,370
What powers?

124
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,290
The Intelligence Agency? The Blue House?

125
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,629
Help us out here, man.

126
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,178
Do the autopsy in the morning,
have it cremated by afternoon.

127
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,350
Damn, all soggy now.

128
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,570
See you again.

129
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,368
The crematorium is closed now anyway.

130
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,204
<i>This will put your father-in-law
in a difficult position.</i>

131
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,373
I know that but…

132
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,918
<i>Don't make it hard for everyone.
Just do as you're told.</i>

133
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,087
Yes, sir.

134
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,144
There is someone here to see you.

135
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,360
I thought you had a dinner to go to.

136
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,279
It's hard to eat
when the Blue House is calling.

137
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:38,989
What's wrong with you?

138
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,952
Those anti-communist thugs
think they are above everyone.

139
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,204
I wanted to teach them a lesson.

140
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,789
Who are you trying to teach?

141
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,293
Do you think this is funny?
Sign the document.

142
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,171
Or we're in for shit.

143
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,757
I'll handle this my way, sir.

144
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,885
I don't care how high up
your father-in-law is.

145
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,472
If I get another call,
I'll fucking sign it myself.

146
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,557
Do you get it?

147
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,811
Is that clear?

148
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,855
I'll sign it.

149
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,862
I thought it might be an important call.

150
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,349
RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST CREMATION

151
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,187
Lay a finger on that body,
and I'll have your asses.

152
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,314
Prosecutor Choi!

153
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,316
Prosecutor Choi!

154
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,775
Prosecutor!

155
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,820
Prosecutor! Hey, open the door.

156
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,572
Open it, damn it!

157
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,491
Open the door!

158
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,502
What took you so long?

159
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,755
PROSECUTOR LEE
THE SUPREME PROSECUTOR OFFICE

160
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,381
-You slow ass…
-Stop!

161
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,634
I'm so damn busy nowadays.

162
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,347
I don't even have time to
wash my hands after using the toilet.

163
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,390
You never do anyway.

164
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,687
Do I deserve all this love
and attention from you?

165
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,690
Come on, let's get dinner.

166
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,902
Does your wife still make
that soup of hers? Let's go have soju.

167
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,654
I can't go home.

168
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,322
What did you do this time?

169
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:47,076
Nothing yet. But I'll wind up
breaking something if I go home.

170
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,540
Who pissed you off this time?

171
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,877
Those little shits down at
the Anti-communist Investigations

172
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,879
act like they are above prosecutors.

173
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,841
They think they're tough shit.

174
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,511
But who dares question their authority?

175
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,722
I'll just screw them and
hand in my resignation.

176
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,101
They won't bat an eyelid.

177
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,603
It's not worth it.

178
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,733
Speaking of which,
I need a favor from you.

179
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,027
A favor?

180
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,083
Good play!

181
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,005
Good game.

182
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,465
Good job.

183
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,095
Your ball is so fast.

184
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,056
Looks like that new tonic
you're taking is a fountain of youth.

185
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,685
Your movements are getting
much faster and better.

186
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,939
We can't find Prosecutor Choi.

187
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,026
We even checked motels in the area.

188
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,694
Is he a commie?

189
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,488
I just don't understand.

190
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,708
Put me through to the DA.

SEOUL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

192
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,593
Sir, Prosecutor Choi is missing.

193
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,928
That pain in the ass!

194
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,223
God damn it.
Get some men out and find him.

195
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,643
Yes sir.

196
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,024
God almighty!

197
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,278
You pain in the ass.

198
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,781
Hey, Prosecutor Choi! Get up!

199
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,533
-Morning, sir.
-Did you sleep well?

200
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:58,040
Director Park called me
first thing this morning.

201
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,125
I don't like where this is going.

202
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,171
Just close the case and move on.

203
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,426
I have to have that autopsy.

204
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,512
You know that he is nobody to mess with.

205
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,891
I haven't seen a single man
who survived pissing him off.

206
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,520
Remember that sexual torture case?

207
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:23,857
We went along with what they said,
and wound up eating shit for ourselves.

208
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,276
I want to do this one right.

209
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,820
Listen to me.

210
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,907
Stop any man on the street
and dig into his family tree,

211
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,868
there's bound to be
at least one North Korean.

212
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,372
You should know who you're dealing with.

213
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,629
All the circumstances point to
death by torture.

214
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,589
All the more reason to stay out of it.

215
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,467
If it goes public, it'll be a shit storm

216
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,595
that none of us can handle.
I can't handle it.

217
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,099
That's why we've got to do this right.
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

218
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,436
Why are you such
a stubborn pain in my ass?

219
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,774
All right. I get it.

220
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,487
Just blame it on me,
the insubordinate ass-pain that ran wild.

221
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,949
That will keep your hands clean.

222
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,413
Are you sure about this?

223
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,331
-Of course not.
-What?

224
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,542
But I know one thing for sure.

225
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,757
Nothing like whiskey for breakfast.

226
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,469
I knew it. What do I do about you?

227
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,763
It all worked out then?

228
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,140
Morning, Mr. Shin.

229
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,850
Morning, Prosecutor Lee.

230
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,977
Yes.

231
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,562
Okay.

232
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:48,025
I understand.
You've got nothing to worry about.

233
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,778
First to arrive, as always.

234
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,906
Early bird gets the worm.

235
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,450
Thank you.

236
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,162
Those cops are in deep shit.
The kid was a college student.

237
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,246
Sorry?

SHIN SUNG-HO, JOURNALIST, <i>JOONGANG DAILY</i>

Oh, right. You're right.

240
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,591
The law student
from Seoul National University, right?

241
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,177
No, not law school.

242
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,929
He was in linguistics.

243
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,056
His name was Park… something or other.

244
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,976
That's right. He was in linguistics.

245
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,731
What a waste of precious life.

246
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,653
Those Anti-communist thugs
run around like rabid dogs.

247
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,951
They are so out of control…

<i>Hello? Chief?</i>

250
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,296
An SNU student died during

251
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,090
in Namyeong-dong.

My son is here? Why?

254
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,943
-There has been an accident.
-What?

255
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,361
Let's go inside.

256
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:19,283
Just let go of me.
Why did you bring me to the morgue?

257
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,203
Honey, what are you doing here?

258
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,290
What's going on?

259
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,625
Where is Jong-chul?

260
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,337
Jong-chul…

261
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,465
Jong-chul!

262
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,386
Jong-chul!

Jong-chul!

00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,412
Smells good.

9 LABOR ACTIVISTS ARRESTED

270
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,086
YOON SANG-SAM,
JOURNALIST, <i>DONGA DAILY</i>

271
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,673
Sang-sam wrote a killer article
on the labor activist movement.

272
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,218
A beautiful piece of work.

273
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,469
What's the point?

274
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,971
We can only print what they allow us.

275
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,975
It's the stuff between the lines, pops.

276
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,770
Leaving some room for interpretation.

277
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,356
Not when they spell it out for you.

278
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:36,610
You're prickly today.
Did you fight with the wife again?

279
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,363
-<i>Joongang Daily</i>!
-Just say you're sorry.

Let's see how their dictation is.

283
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,835
Shit! Come on.

284
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,421
-What's going on?
-Give me one, too!

285
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,884
-Not the front page. The other page.
-The current affairs section!

286
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,595
-I can't fucking believe this.
-What the hell is going on?

287
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,431
-Where is it?
-Which hospital?

288
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,522
Chief, I just saw the article.

289
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,066
Who cross-checked the info?

290
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,151
That's the least of my worries!

291
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,154
The military just stormed
into our offices.

292
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,448
What?

293
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,452
You said you checked all the facts.

294
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,497
They don't care about that!
We violated journalism guidelines.

295
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,581
Where is the Current Affairs?

296
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,459
Find somewhere to lay low and stay there.

297
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,837
If they catch you,
you'll be beaten to death.

298

I'm so sorry, sir!

304
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,694
I'll do everything in my power
to contain the situation, sir!

COMMISSIONER GENERAL
POLICE HEADQUARTERS

306
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,244
It seems like we've worked
ourselves into a corner.

307
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,122
Things like this happen
while conducting national affairs.

308
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,582
It will work itself out.

309
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,624
Shut up!

310
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,753
It could cost us our necks!

311
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,509
Cut out the ego bullshit. Sit down.

312
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,807
The President threw the papers
to the floor.

313
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,685
This is serious.

314
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,607
We have to put out the fire first.

315
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,151
Read this at the press briefing.

316
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,991
LEFTIST STUDENT DIES OF HEART ATTACK

317
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,951
So that's what happened.

318
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:55,749
And I swear on the honor of the police,

319
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,211
there was no excessive force employed.

320
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,047
Then how did he die?

321
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,051
Well, it seems that…
During the investigation,

322
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,512
the investigator slammed his hands…

323
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,974
on the table and…

324
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,684
Please continue.

325
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,146
The student was terrified.

326
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:23,151
So when the investigator slammed
his hands on the table, he just…

327
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,034
-He just dropped dead.
-What?

328
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,287
Does that make any sense?

329
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,082
Dying from someone slamming
their hands on a table?

330
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,584
The official cause of death
is a heart attack.

331
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,587
A perfectly healthy young man
had a heart attack

332
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,755
by sudden shock?

333
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,467
A doctor from Chungang Hospital
confirmed this case.

334
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,137
What's the doctor's name?

335
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,098
His name?

336
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,854
-Oh, what was his name?
-It hasn't been confirmed yet, right?

337
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,732
Of course it has.
The doctor's name is Oh Yun-sang.

338
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,485
-Did you get that?
-Oh Yun-sang, Chungang Hospital.

339
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,989
-Let's go to Chungang Hospital!
-Find Oh Yun-sang!

340
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,782
-Let's go.
-It's Oh Yun-sang!

341
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,583
I said too much, didn't I?

342
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,460
Sorry…

343
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,971
CHUNGANG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

344
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,222
Out of my way!

345
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,482
So he died of heart attack
from sudden shock?

346
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:49,362
Well, I can't comment until
the autopsy has been completed--

347
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,114
Was he still alive at the ER?

348
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,825
He didn't come to the ER.
I saw him in Namyeong-dong…

349
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,703
Namyeong-dong? What did you do?

350
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,332
I arrived after
the cardiac arrest occurred.

351
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,958
Give us more details.

352
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:06,254
I mean, after I arrived at the scene,
I dried the body,

353
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,839
then checked the--

354
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,424
The kid was wet?

355
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,220
We need details.

356
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,014
Are you saying the body was wet?

357
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,808
The detectives said…

358
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,853
They said that the deceased
was heavily intoxicated,

359
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,397
so he drank a lot of water
during the investigation.

360
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,941
He was heavily intoxicated?

361
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,610
He'd been drinking rice wine…

362
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,070
Who is he kidding?

363
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,030
So did he die of shock or not?

364
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,491
What should I write?
He didn't give us anything.

365
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,661
Why are you even worried?
We will be given guidelines anyway.

366
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,912
Do you know any doctor?

367
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,373
If I knew any,
I would already have had an interview.

368
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,128
-Stay right here, understood?
-Yes sir.

369
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,965
Where is the restroom?

370
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,181
4:00 P.M. JANUARY 15, 1987
HANYANG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

371
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,599
Good afternoon, Prosecutor.

372
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,769
Did you bring enough roll films?

373
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,313
I brought ten with me.

374
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,066
That's great. Oh, they're here.

375
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,861
I'm Dr. Hwang from the National Crime Lab.

376
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,488
I'll be witnessing.

377
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,658
This is a very sensitive case,
so please do everything by the book.

378
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,538
Make sure to leave no detail out. Got it?

379
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,291
Is this necessary? It's just a formality.

380
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,419
PROSECUTOR PYO
SEOUL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

381
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,256
Is that how you do your job?

382
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,924
I apologize.

383
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,801
Let's go.

384
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,267
Who are you people?

385
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,270
-Just piss off.
-Who told you to do an autopsy?

386
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,732
We have an official order for an autopsy.

387
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,693
We heard nothing about it,
so it's not happening.

388
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,820
I'm a public prosecutor!

389
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:58,491
Oh, really? We're sorry for our insolence.

390
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,494
Jong-chul!

391
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,913
-Stop!
-Jong-chul!

392
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,087
-Let go of me!
-Hey!

393
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,048
Leave her alone!

394
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,342
-Mom!
-Mom!

395
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,555
Let me see him for the last time.

396
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,350
This is my last chance. Please…

397
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,810
-Get her out of here.
-Please just for a moment.

398
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,230
-Come on.
-Please for the last time!

399
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,859
-Let me touch his hand!
-Get her out of here!

400
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,611
Please let me see him…

401
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,495
What are you here for?

402
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,456
Did you smirk at me?
I'll remember your faces.

403
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,249
Fucking thugs!

404
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,378
KIM JUNG-NAM SPY RING

405
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,797
JANG YEONG-DAL ARRESTED

406
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,264
KIM JUNG-NAM

407
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,726
I think you should take this.

408
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,648
Who is this?

409
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,317
<i>This is Prosecutor Choi with
the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office.</i>

410
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,278
I'm at Hanyang University Hospital,

411
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,365
and your men are refusing to cooperate.

412
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,660
<i>I've been through this with
the necessary people.</i>

413
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,412
<i>That autopsy isn't happening.</i>

414
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,416
Old man, I don't like
your condescending tone.

415
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,376
I'm the Director of
Anti-communist Investigations.

416
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,838
<i>And that puts you above the law?</i>

417
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,882
<i>Should I send over
some of my boys to teach you?</i>

418
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:38,925
What did you say?

419
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:43,680
Open your books and check
who has the jurisdiction here.

420
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:49,561
And you better lose that accent
before you're mistaken for Kim Il Sung.

421
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,030
Get the car out.

422
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,115
Yes, sir.

423
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,125
That crazy fucker!

424
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,211
What the hell?

425
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,186
This is the official order
for the autopsy.

426
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,397
Nice work hiding behind a piece of paper.

427
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,067
Let's not make a scene.
We will do this by the book.

428
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,952
If hunting dogs miss their target
while fighting among themselves,

429
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,333
who do you think the master
is going to punish for this?

430
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,336
I consider myself a stray
without a master.

431
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:00,632
You better watch yourself.
I'm liable to bite anyone.

432
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,008
Is that right?

433
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,179
But only your jaws will hurt.

434
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:15,772
Wait.

435
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,861
My father's cousin's daughter

436
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,950
just married a journalist
from this foreign newspaper.

437
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,286
Peter Henderson something or other.

438
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,957
He's been hounding me
for a story recently.

439
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,625
Jeez.

440
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,796
The President would be quite upset
to read about this in the foreign press

441
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,506
before the Seoul Olympics.

442
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,100
What is it that you want?

443
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,605
I don't fucking want anything.
I just want to do my job right.

444
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,482
All right.

445
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,360
Go for it, then.

446
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,072
It's not going to change anything.

447
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,537
Let's get out of here.

448
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,001
I'm doing the autopsy.

449
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,253
I got your neck.

450
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,173
Go wander the streets
with the rest of the strays.

451
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,932
I guess I just dug my own grave.

452
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,939
I'll have to drink soju from now.

453
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,783
9:50 P.M. JANUARY 15, 1987
HANYANG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

454
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,291
Are you with the victim's family?
Your name, please.

455
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,629
Park Wol-gil, I'm Jong-chul's uncle.

456
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,049
Please take a seat.

457
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,842
Shall we?

458
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,793
I'm going to the restroom.

459
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,561
Doctor, I'm a journalist from <i>Donga Daily</i>.

460
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,314
Did you see any signs of torture?

461
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,485
I waited here for too long.

462
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:13,116
You said the body was wet.
What was the condition of the body?

463
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,286
Just tell me what you saw.

464
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,540
Doctor!

465
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:29,132
There was water everywhere on the floor.

466
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,387
And there was a bathtub in the room.

467
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,728
I heard crackling in the lungs.

468
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,022
Crackles?

469
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,899
Do you confirm the cause of death?

470
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,948
Yes.

471
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,714
Stop them!

472
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,674
No pictures!

473
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,552
Please say a word. Please!

474
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,722
-Mr. Park!
-Any comments?

475
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,390
The police murdered him!

476
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,893
The police murdered him!

477
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:27,815
My nephew didn't die of shock.
He was murdered!

478
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,068
He was killed during torture, wasn't he?

479
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,404
He was tortured with water, right?

480
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,171
This is what you'll say
when you give your statement tomorrow.

481
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,423
They're aware of it, too.

482
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:57,261
But I only dropped by to give them a hand.

483
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,849
There are formalities to go through.
Think of it as an early vacation.

484
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,102
I know you're good at lying.

485
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,813
I don't deserve this.

486
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,317
How dare you question my authority?

487
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,070
I did everything exactly as I was told.

488
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,447
-Why should I--
-Han-kyung.

489
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,785
Yes, Director.

490
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,163
Just go along with it.

491
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,046
As you command, sir.

492
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,215
-We have to run the story
-What's going on?

493
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,342
before they wipe it under the carpet.

494
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,761
I even got my arm broken.
I have nothing to fear!

495
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,513
-Did he find something?
-Will you take the responsibility?

496
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,557
-We should be responsible?
-For what?

497
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,016
Wait. He's coming.

498
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,269
-You alright, man?
-What happened?

499
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,813
-Let's go.
-Where are you going?

500
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,148
Attention, everyone!

501
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,484
From tomorrow, we're running a special
on torture prevention.

502
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,527
What?

503
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,781
Launch a task force
to find out who killed him and how.

504
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,366
What about the guidelines?

505
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,746
Fuck that!

506
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,665
Just fuck it!

507
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,210
The police tortured and killed a student!

508
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:15,464
I don't give a rat's ass about
goddamn guidelines.

509
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,049
Yes sir.

510
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,904
Dr. Hwang! I really appreciate
you going through all of this.

511
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,030
Take a seat.

512
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,408
How did it go?

513
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:49,916
Well, the cause of death was asphyxiation
due to airway obstruction.

514
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,961
The victim's windpipe was
crushed during tor--

515
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,962
Watch your mouth!

516
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,217
Listen to me carefully.
If you say that boy was tortured,

517
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,887
you'll pretty much sign
all of our death warrants.

518
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,642
But there are marks all over the body.

519
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,145
That will be taken care of
once the body is cremated.

520
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:19,028
Just put "heart attack" in the report.

521
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,489
Do you get it?

522
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,540
Here, take some downtime with your team.

523
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,548
I'm sorry, Commissioner.

524
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,054
You're digging your own grave.

525
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,977
I'm announcing it as a heart attack.
Understand?

526
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,076
A pulmonary hemorrhage in his right lung,

527
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,453
is most likely a result of TB.

528
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:15,126
The contusions on the throat and chest
are remnants of efforts at resuscitation.

529
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,089
Thus, there were no signs
of unnecessary force or brutality.

Mom!

532
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,058
-Mom!
-Mom, please! Mom!

533
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,143
Mom…

534
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,437
Mom…

535
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,815
-Mom…
-Mom…

536
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,236
My son's not a commie…

537
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,113
Mom…

538
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,490
<i>Report positions.</i>

539
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,576
Vehicle Two on the move.

540
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,041
You're obstructing journalists!

541
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,417
Align shields!

542
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,753
-Step back!
-Let us through!

543
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,508
Let us through!

544
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,307
Lift shields!

545
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:19,815
Mr. Park!

546
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,145
-Look. Should we take a U-turn here?
-Wait, wait.

547
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,356
Not that car.

548
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,941
-Give me the camera.
-The camera?

549
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,611
-But the bus is going straight.
-No, not straight.

550
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:09,532
-What are they doing?
-Which car is which?

551
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,700
I got it. It was 2382. Left! Make a left.

552
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,494
-Left?
-Let's go.

553
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,331
Move your damn car!

554
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,918
Get out of the way!

555
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,888
Hey! Stop them!

556
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,932
Stop the car!

557
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,812
-I'm with <i>Donga Daily</i>.
-Stop, you rats!

558
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,897
You smashed our camera!

559
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,817
Don't touch me!
Why can't we cover the story?

560
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,653
Why not?

561
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,386
Jong-chul…

562
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,058
Dad…

563
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,022
Why can't you leave?

564
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,235
Can't you leave, my boy?

565
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:36,702
Why do you linger here?

566
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,129
Bye, my son. Goodbye…

567
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,549
Bye, my son…

568
00:41:55,221 --> 00:42:00,976
I have nothing to say to you. My boy…

569
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,820
I just need to see him.

570
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,365
I said not today!

571
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,824
I'm an accredited reporter!

572
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,661
No one's allowed in today.
Why don't you listen to us?

573
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,162
Come back later. Not today.

574
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,544
More pain in the ass.

575
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,761
Just go, for fuck's sake!

576
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,888
Did you just swear at me?

577
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,974
Easy, Mr. Yoon.

578
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,979
Let me check some facts.
He died from drowning, didn't he?

579
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,564
Drowning, my ass.

580
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,858
What was it then?
Death by excessive force?

581
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,903
Just tell me for God's sake!

582
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,447
Why should I tell you that?
It's your job to find out.

583
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,909
You're in this together.
They promised you something?

584
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,953
A place in the Intelligence?
The Blue House?

585
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,917
Yes, I'm trying to ass-kiss
my way up the ladder.

586
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,380
Shame on you.

4:00 P.M. JANUARY 19, 1987

594
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,539
This isn't the Internal Affairs office.
Where are we?

595
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:33,212
-Director, what is going on?
-Cuff them.

596
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,673
Let go of me!

597
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,466
Let go!

598
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,804
Do not resist.

599
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,399
Back off!

600
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:59,488
You are arrested for murder
by the use of excessive force.

601
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,783
You are no longer police officers

602
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,245
-but criminals.
-Director!

603
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,413
You hear?

604
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,837
I had no choice.
The order came from the Blue House.

605
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,046
Where did you take them?

606
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:21,218
I can't tell you
because I know exactly what you will do.

607
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,723
Brace yourself, Director Park.

608
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,518
Sometimes you have got to cut off
the tail to save the body.

609
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,022
It's the secret office
in Singil-dong, sir.

610
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,745
Back off!

611
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,044
Sir!

612
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,713
Director, please…

613
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,512
-Director!
-Sir!

614
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,515
-You fucking heathens.
-Release him now!

615
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,393
-What are you doing?
-No, you can't do this!

616
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,897
Stop! Stop right there!

617
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:19,985
Director Park, do you realize
you're disobeying a direct order--

618
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:32,080
You're disobeying orders
and assaulting superiors?

619
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,465
You think we're the same police,
you and I?

620
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,843
While you and your men got fat off bribes,

621
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,888
I was out there risking my life,
trying to bring down the commies.

622
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:55,521
This country would've been devoured
by Kim Il Sung if it wasn't for me.

623
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,897
Do you understand?

624
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,068
You're making a huge mistake.
If the President finds out about this…

625
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,743
Listen carefully.

626
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,330
Anyone that stands between
me and the enemy

627
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,085
is an enemy himself.

628
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,680
Get them out of my sight.

629
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,808
-Move.
-Stand up!

630
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,448
Does it hurt?

631
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,742
Not as much as my pride.

632
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,204
Lift your head.

633
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:59,710
You're a patriot. Don't ever cower.

634
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,795
They are accusing me of
firs-degree murder.

635
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,881
That is a minimum of ten years.

636
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,176
I'll get the charges reduced

637
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,847
to involuntary manslaughter
then a suspended sentence.

638
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,225
I have five mouths to feed.

639
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,146
I'll take care of them too.

640
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,863
As you command, sir.

641
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,532
Good.

642
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,244
You know I take care of my own.

659
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,980
I said come here.

660
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,482
Show me your ID.

661
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,237
Is this all? Search him.

662
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,613
Got anything else?

663
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,200
Which bus goes to Pil-dong?

664
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,410
Stop!

00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,454
-Hey!
-Get off of me!

666
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,623
Stop, you son of a bitch!

667
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,792
Shit. Hey, take him in!

668
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,473
I'm home. Gosh, I'm so tired.

669
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:23,353
Where have you been?
Going around looking for trouble?

670
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,231
You should be thinking about
getting married instead.

671
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,151
I've been out looking for
a nice girl to marry me.

672
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,361
That's such nonsense.

673
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,282
So were you out on a date? Were you?

674
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,492
Stop wasting your time
doing worthless things.

675
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,702
Will you leave me alone?

676
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,997
Are you hanging out with
those bad influences again?

677
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,874
I'm the bad influence.

678
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,043
It's not normal for someone my age
to live with his nagging sister.

679
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,004
Stop saying that.

680
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,424
There is stew inside. Go eat.

681
00:50:56,136 --> 00:51:01,016
I ought to find a woman like you.

682
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,769
Oh, cut it out.

683
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,313
Okay. What about Yeon-hee?

684
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,899
She's sleeping.
That's all she's been doing all day.

685
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,985
<i>"I want to listen to this song

687
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:19,493
<i>All right.
Here goes a song for anxious youth,</i>

688
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,870
<i>"The Veiled Path" by Yoo Jae-ha.</i>

689
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,168
Damned old thing.

690
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,629
You won't break it like that.
Do you want a hammer?

691
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,133
I told you to fix it, didn't I?

692
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,469
Hey, I'm not an electrician.

693
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:41,598
You sound more and more
like your mother every day.

694
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,476
Here. I found this in the trash.

695
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,896
I thought you would need this.

696
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,190
What is it? Snacks?

697
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:57,447
A Walkman? Really? Byung-yong!

698
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,243
You're the best uncle ever.

699
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,954
Get away from me.
You only like me when I give you a gift.

700
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,374
It's my college acceptance gift.

701
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,049
-Yeon-hee.
-Yes?

702
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,807
And this…

703
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,810
You want me to meet him again?

704
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:28,645
Well…

705
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,232
I get stopped at the checkpoints
every time.

706
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,567
But they never stop you.

707
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,529
Wake up! You almost lost your job
by messing with that union business.

708
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,239
This isn't about the union.

709
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,365
Yes, right.

710
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,327
This is really for a good cause.

711
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,913
I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't a good thing.

712
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,337
Sure about that?

713
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,048
Running an errand for
a convict is a good thing?

714
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,385
-Well, if you feel that way…
-Hey!

715
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,096
You said it was for me.

716
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,598
-Du-bong also got into college.
-Who's that?

717
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,974
My boss' son.

718
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,612
-It's the last time, okay?
-Of course. Deal!

719
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,616
You can record, too?

720
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,034
Check out auto-reverse.

721
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,077
This is awesome!

722
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,292
-Give me that.
-Pass.

723
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,176
You, hey!

724
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,887
Attention! Stop daydreaming!

725
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:48,391
What the hell are you staring at,
assholes?

726
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,854
-I'll leave you to it then.
-Thank you, Abbot.

727
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,943
What did you want to see me about?

728
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:02,072
HAM SE-WOONG, PRIEST
CATHOLIC PRIESTS' ASSOCIATION FOR JUSTICE

729
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:09,204
KIM JUNG-NAM, WANTED FOR LEADING
NUMEROUS DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS

730
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:13,375
You're making a statement
demanding truth about the student's death?

731
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,709
We plan to do it tomorrow.

732
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,295
Don't mention that there could be
more officers involved

733
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,255
but just ask for punishing
the person in charge.

734
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,176
If the police raise their guard even more,

735
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:28,473
getting to the bottom
of the truth will become difficult.

736
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:34,020
I heard the prison security
section chief is as tough as nails.

737
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,898
Even the guards aren't
allowed to talk to them.

738
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,901
We'll make it happen.

739
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,948
We'll find out the names and ranks

740
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,575
of everyone responsible

741
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,539
for the death.

742
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,292
Father,

743
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:03,299
our only weapon is the truth.

744
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:08,096
And that truth will
bring down this administration.

745
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:10,890
Mr. Kim!

746
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,935
What a pleasant surprise!

747
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,820
Uncle says he's sorry he couldn't
deliver the news you've been waiting for.

748
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,614
I see.

749
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,702
You don't look like
you're here for Buddhist service.

750
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,290
You must be the ring leader
behind all of this.

751
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,127
This is Yeon-hee. She's Guard Han's niece.

752
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,256
Turn yourself in,
and you will find the peace you seek.

753
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,809
Sir!

754
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,645
AHN YOO, SECURITY SECTION CHIEF
AT YEONGDEUNGPO PENITENTIARY

755
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,367
-Jin-gyu!
-Sweetheart…

756
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,827
-Jin-gyu!
-Baby!

757
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,789
-Jin-gyu.
-Mom…

758
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,876
Dad.

759
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,211
Are you okay, son?

760
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,089
What have you done?

761
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,218
It's nothing, Mom.
I'm going to figure it out.

762
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,428
You killed a man.
How can you say it's nothing?

763
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:36,101
We didn't raise you like that.
How could you kill a man?

764
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,352
Dad…

765
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:43,108
Dad, it's not what you think.
You have to believe me.

766
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,320
What do you mean? Tell me what happened.

767
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:52,826
I only held his legs.
Someone else killed him.

768
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,120
It wasn't me! I didn't do it--

769
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,121
Get him out of here.

770
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,374
-Jin-gyu!
-Son!

771
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,500
Jin-gyu!

772
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,670
-Jin-gyu!
-Please, Jin-gyu!

773
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,588
Get them out of here!

774
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,674
-Jin-gyu!
-Let go of me!

775
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,551
Please abide by visitor regulations.

776
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,928
Jin-gyu!

777
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:20,770
If you write this again,
I'll blow up the goddamn place.

778
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,869
VISITOR'S LOG

779
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,204
This is Chief Ahn.

780
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,708
<i>This is Han. 4879 requests for a meeting.</i>

781
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,335
I'll be right there.

782
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,804
Good evening.

783
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,932
Chief Ahn.

784
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,479
I heard you requested a meeting.
Is there a problem?

785
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:07,442
I heard those new inmates
are causing a problem.

786
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,572
That's the prison's problem.
What are your complaints?

787
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,408
Is it true that

788
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,412
there are
more cops involved in the torture?

789
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,795
If you have no complaints,
this interview is over.

790
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,797
You may stay a while longer, if you want.

791
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,136
Do you want to be
an accomplice to their crime?

792
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,931
I'm not at liberty to discuss
information obtained on duty.

793
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,727
You can't keep the truth
behind these bars!

794
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:47,899
My job is to protect and guard.

795
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:18,304
2:00 P.M. MARCH 3, 1987
49TH DAY AFTER PARK JONG-CHUL'S DEATH

796
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,306
What's the matter with him? Jung-mi!

797
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,726
Hey, you're late again.

798
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,981
I guess you were busy getting
all dolled up for a blind date, obviously.

799
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,567
Do I look fine? I just washed my face.

800
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,778
You have lipstick on your teeth.

801
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:38,324
Down with the student killers,
down with the torturers!

802
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,952
-Down with the tortures!
-Down with the tortures!

803
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:41,911
Let's go.

804
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:45,039
Wait, he's cute.

805
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,500
-Please take a look at it.
-Citizens!

806
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,711
Today, there will be
a memorial service for Park Jong-chul.

807
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,838
Let's rise in protest!

808
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,091
-Bring back, Park Jong-chul!
-Bring back, Park Jong-chul!

809
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,093
Please take one.

810
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,761
-Bring back, Park Jong-chul!
-Bring back, Park Jong-chul!

811
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,555
MEMORIAL MARCH FOR THE LATE PARK JONG-CHUL

812
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:05,226
-Bring back, Park Jong-chul!
-Bring back, Park Jong-chul!

813
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,269
Come on, let's go.

814
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:13,860
Yeon-hee!

815
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,614
Arrest them all!

816
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,207
Get down! You commies!

817
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,680
I'm not a protester!

818
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,851
My goodness…

819
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,321
You son of a bitch!

820
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,032
Goddamn commies!

821
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,588
Bitch!

822
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,927
-Stop there!
-Fucking bitch!

823
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:21,928
Wait.

824
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,600
Stop, you commies!

825
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,109
You fucking commies!

826
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,406
This way.

827
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:48,705
Hurry.

828
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:52,500
We're closed. Come back later.

829
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,838
-Pull the damn thing up.
-I said we're closed, dammit!

830
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,133
-Pull up the shutter!
-Shut your mouth!

831
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,852
Damned protesters…

832
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,983
It was my first blind date.

833
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:21,529
Don't rub it with your hands.
It'll sting more.

834
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,118
Wash it with water.

835
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,265
Your shoe…

836
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,148
I've still got my socks.

837
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,567
If you go out like that,
you're sure to get caught.

838
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,527
Size 9?

839
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:05,031
It's 8,000 won, but you can take them
for 5,000 won.

840
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,660
Sorry but I don't have money now.

841
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,078
What?

842
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:12,747
I got this.

843
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,458
No, it's okay.

844
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,084
But she wants to get them for you.

845
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,211
Here.

846
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,129
I'm paying you back.

847
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,388
Oh god…

848
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,102
-Oh, my god.
-Hey, wait.

849
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,778
VISITOR'S LOG

850
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,075
I said no records, goddammit.

851
01:03:55,915 --> 01:04:00,795
I'm cross-checking the statements
because they don't match.

852
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:06,425
You said that the victim had
his hands cuffed behind his back,

853
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:12,807
but we found no signs of cuffing
on the victim's wrists.

854
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:18,271
Is this necessary? The charge is
involuntary manslaughter, anyway.

855
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,772
Involuntary manslaughter?

856
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:26,320
Your charges are murder by torture!

857
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,116
The charges haven't been reduced?

858
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,286
In your dreams!

859
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,914
If you don't cooperate,
I'll go for 15 years.

860
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,457
Better get your act straight.

861
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,587
Son of a bitch…

862
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,046
What did you say?

863
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,258
I didn't kill him.

864
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:48,467
What?

865
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:52,054
Are you deaf?
It wasn't me that killed him!

866
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:56,017
-This isn't how it's supposed to go.
-Inspector Cho!

867
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,184
Get him out of here.

868
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,061
We'll resume in the near future.

869
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,230
What's going on here?

870
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,316
What are you doing?

871
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:07,778
-What the hell are you doing?
-Please, stop.

872
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,615
Tell Director Park
to meet his end of the bargain.

873
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,118
What the hell?

874
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,829
You want a piece of me?

875
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,666
You should be telling them that.

876
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,297
Why are you doing this, Inspector Cho?

877
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,803
It was you that killed
an innocent kid, not me.

878
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,058
Grab him.

879
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:38,851
Don't you dare!

880
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,359
Your lives depend on my words.

881
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,362
Remember that.

882
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,825
This interview is over.

883
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,080
Fuck!

884
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,803
-Sir.
-What the hell are you retards doing?

885
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,221
Ministry of Culture!

886
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,139
Send out the new journalism guidelines.

887
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:21,143
The protests are about direct election.

888
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,898
That's what is causing
the senseless violence in the streets.

889
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,024
-Yes, sir.
-And--

890
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,110
Ministry of Interior.

891
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:32,279
Set up more checkpoints,
especially near universities.

892
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,280
Yes, sir.

893
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:37,034
Increase CS gas production
to full capacity.

894
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,160
Yes, sir.

895
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:40,621
Do I have to tell you every little thing?

896
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,800
I heard about what happened at the prison.

897
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:56,929
You must reduce the charges
to involuntary manslaughter.

898
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:01,976
We just managed to put out the fire,
and now you want to rekindle it.

899
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,854
PARK JONG-CHUL PROTESTS ON THE RISE

900
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:08,399
It'll be a loose end if we don't.

901
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:13,195
I can postpone the trial indefinitely.

902
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,449
You figure out the rest.

903
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:20,161
The President is

904
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,248
deeply concerned about this matter.

905
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,437
BANK OF SEOUL AND TRUST COMPANY
NAME: KANG JIN-GYU

906
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:51,025
Wait. 1 million, 10 million…
What? 100 million?

907
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,907
Is this for ten years of my life?

908
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,704
Take me out of here within this month.

909
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,625
After the President passes down
the presidency to his successor,

910
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,378
there will be a presidential pardon.

911
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,130
You want me to wait until next year?

912
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,342
I've been fooled before.

913
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,012
I've got nothing to lose, anyway.

914
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:23,224
I'll tell the truth,
place my bet with the courts.

915
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,351
This is a very important time right now.

916
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:27,228
Be the patriot that--

917
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,730
Don't talk to me about patriotism!

918
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,151
I haven't had
a single night of sleep here.

919
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:41,242
Even in the dark,
my ears are filled with screams.

920
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,454
Screams of those I hurt over the years!

921
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:51,669
Do you honestly think we're patriots?

922
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:56,882
You ungrateful bastard!

923
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,097
Back off!

924
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,519
I'll put a goddamn bullet in your face!

925
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,106
Do it.

926
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,983
Shoot me!

927
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:23,659
No, I have a better idea.

928
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:28,706
I'm going to throw your wife
and children in the Imjin River.

929
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,168
I'll say they tried to cross
into North Korea.

930
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,837
You know exactly how it's done.

931
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:40,509
I'll make you live the rest of
your life in agonizing Hell.

932
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:43,929
Director…

933
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:47,766
Now choose.

934
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,811
Patriot or traitor?

935
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,900
As you command…

936
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:00,321
As you command, sir!

937
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:13,667
Director, this is far beyond
prison regulations.

938
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:16,045
Per regulations, visitors cannot--

939
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,428
Visitors cannot come in physical contact
with inmates.

940
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,554
Shut up!

941
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,987
You're trying really hard.

942
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,032
Take your boys out to drink.

943
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,544
Get in that line.

944
01:10:59,088 --> 01:10:59,964
Pass.

945
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,591
-Get in that line.
-Where is your student ID?

946
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:04,843
Your student ID number?

947
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,222
It's 8711023.

948
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:13,102
I never got stopped before.
Seriously, do I look like an activist?

949
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:17,815
Well, yes.
You kind of look like one today.

950
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:19,984
The perfect match for
your protesting knight.

951
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:20,985
What?

952
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,488
I told you, he's not an activist.

953
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:28,575
Are you kidding me? Of course, he is.

954
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,203
Anyway, he probably won't
even recognize you.

955
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,664
Unless your makeup is all smeared.

956
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:37,793
-Want me to smudge it?
-Cut it out.

957
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,547
Learn from me, and carry your
books in your arms like this.

958
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,757
Then they will never stop you.

959
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,009
I look innocent, right?

960
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,971
Girlish.
A college goddess like Kim Hui-ae.

961
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:55,477
It's pathetic hiding
your breasts behind books.

962
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:01,400
There is no shame in having small breasts.

963
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,988
Hey, I don't have small boobs!

964
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,114
My boobs are--

965
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:11,160
Holy crap!

966
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,079
That's him?

967
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:19,668
Communist or not, he's totally hot.

968
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:23,172
Oh, no! He actually recognized you.

969
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:26,425
Smile.

970
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:28,802
Hi! You're a freshman?

971
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,929
Yes…

972
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:34,016
You can skip the intros.
It's not like you haven't met.

973
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:36,518
Oh, okay…

974
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,147
We're holding a video screening
if you wanna come.

975
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,149
Sorry?

976
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:44,193
We'll draw caricatures afterward.

977
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,906
Sure. We'll be there.

978
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:52,076
By the way, nice sneakers.

979
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,161
They look brand new!

980
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,166
They're cheap though.

981
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,920
Thanks. See you!

982
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:14,264
My gosh, he doesn't recognize you at all.
He said they were cheap stuff.

983
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,308
You're right. It was cheap. Get off of me.

984
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,268
I said get off of me!

985
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,231
-Come here!
-I'm not going.

986
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,982
It's okay. He doesn't even know you.

987
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,985
-I said I'm not going.
-Let's go!

988
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,282
Okay, okay.

989
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,411
What is it? Are you putting on make-up?

990
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:39,540
-Please come this way.
-So annoying.

991
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,667
-Welcome.
-Please take a seat.

992
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,132
Shall we start?

993
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:57,933
Thank you for coming out.
We'll start the screening shortly.

994
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,852
What kind of movie is it?

995
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,396
It's a documentary. From abroad.

996
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:06,442
You all know
about the Gwangju Uprising, right?

997
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,447
The truth is in here.

998
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,240
Shit. Let's go.

999
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:36,573
The first time I saw it,
I couldn't finish either.

1000
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,996
I was so shocked--

1001
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,916
Why are you showing this
at a cartoon club?

1002
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:47,668
What are you going to do?

1003
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,546
Fight the army?

1004
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:54,466
How will you fight them?
If someone else dies,

1005
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,760
who will be responsible then?

1006
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:06,228
We've interrogated 22 men
about Kim Jung-nam's hideout,

1007
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:08,981
but no luck so far.

1008
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:12,943
You're sparing your bones?

1009
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:14,778
KIM JUNG-NAM'S COUSIN

1010
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:19,116
I'm sorry,
but the boys' morale isn't like before.

1011
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,245
Attention!

1012
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:32,879
This is Director Park.

1013
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:36,216
<i>Turn on the TV.
Presidential conference is starting soon.</i>

1014
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,218
Yes, sir.

1015
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:41,597
<i>The President is waiting
for Kim Jung-nam's arrest.</i>

1016
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:45,267
Prove these political dissidents
are North Korean spies

1017
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,477
and make Park Jong-chul case go away.

1018
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,813
That's our only hope.

1019
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:52,065
<i>And your last chance.</i>

1020
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,862
THE BLUE HOUSE

1021
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:01,992
Release them all.

1022
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:07,789
At a time like this, we have got to
bring in more, not release them.

1023
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,542
When I was living in the North,

1024
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,420
I had a dog that used to run away.

1025
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,382
Do you want to know how I always found it?

1026
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:23,847
I'd go for a walk
with a female dog in heat.

1027
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:29,227
Without fail, the runaway dog
would come out running and drooling.

1028
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,939
<i>I've decided that</i>

1029
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,861
<i>it is impossible to revise
the constitution during my term.</i>

1030
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:43,367
<i>In order to assure a peaceful transition
of power, my term will terminate</i>

1031
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,285
<i>on the 25th of February, next year…</i>

1032
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,663
Jung-nam can't help
but crawl out of his hole now.

1033
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,708
Use his bitches as baits.

1034
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:53,669
As you command, sir.

1035
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,713
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

1036
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,674
Hey, take that one, too.

1037
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:05,222
<i>…and those who seek to divide the nation…</i>

1038
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,933
That's bullshit. How can he do this?

1039
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,520
Direct election is out of the question.

1040
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:14,564
This is a blatant extension
of dictatorship.

1041
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:15,899
What does this mean for us?

1042
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:18,443
Get ready to be busy as hell.

1043
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,406
Politics! Current Affairs! Gather up!

1044
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:27,619
What does this mean?

1045
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,455
That means he will choose
the next President himself.

1046
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,041
Fuck! One more <i>soju</i> here.

1047
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,085
-Coming up.
-No, we're good.

1048
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,589
Attorney Choi,
you have a trial in an hour.

1049
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,302
Fuck trial.

1050
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:49,057
That son of a bitch. So he's going to rule
for another seven years?

1051
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,851
Not just seven.

1052
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,687
He'll hold power as long
as they hold elections in the gym.

1053
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,605
What's that mean?

1054
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:58,316
Indirect elections, you dumb ass.

1055
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,027
How did you get into college, man?

1056
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:04,114
-You're a college student, man.
-Goddamn fixed game.

1057
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:08,285
-What are you doing?
-We should at least do something.

1058
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,537
Let me help.

1059
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:13,039
Fire up the printing press.

1060
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:15,125
-Where is it?
-Over there.

1061
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:19,421
<i>I have well received the opinion
and the decision of the country,</i>

1062
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,590
<i>and to proceed by accepting it,</i>

1063
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:26,386
<i>I promise to bring the new future
for the country itself and…</i>

1064
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,722
I need to go out for a moment, Abbot.

1065
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:32,350
It's too risky to go out like that.

1066
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:39,274
What's the point of
a direct election anyway?

1067
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:41,359
I know they pay people for the election.

1068
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,279
You're right.
This country isn't ready for democracy.

1069
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,574
Get ready for your shifts!

1070
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:58,251
<i>Also, I truly believe
that this direct election</i>

1071
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,504
<i>will bring the new future for the country.</i>

1072
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:05,717
I've got all of your backs.

1073
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,429
Go out and find every

1074
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,766
commie supporter you can find.

1075
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,811
Eradicate them.

1076
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:19,439
Eradicate communism!

1077
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:27,072
We released Kim Jung-nam's bitches.

1078
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:34,663
Prisoner 4879!

1079
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,333
You have a meeting.

1080
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:43,296
In here.

1081
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:08,363
VISITOR'S LOG, DIALOGUE SUMMARY

1082
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:10,490
I had to write some of them from memory.

1083
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:17,789
This is all I can do.

1084
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:28,884
You have until morning call.

1085
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,199
Stop there.

1086
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:57,746
Me?

1087
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,499
No rest for the weary, right?

1088
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,878
I'm with the Ministry of Justice.

1089
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:11,217
That's just my magazine.

1090
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,385
You're a prison guard?

1091
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:15,764
You look more like…

1092
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,267
Like I belong on the
other side of the bars.

1093
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:25,023
I think the prisoners leave
a stink on me or something.

1094
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:27,150
What's this?

1095
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:30,487
I got it to help pass time.

1096
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,533
-Pass.
-Thank you, officers.

1097
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:41,414
-Nothing like the tabloid to kill time.
-Digest is better.

1098
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,125
<i>The Reader's Digest.</i>

1099
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,594
Bitch Six just left the temple.

1100
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:57,889
-I thought Kim Jung-nam was Catholic.
-So did I.

1101
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:00,475
Go check it out.

1102
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:05,605
You take the back.

1103
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,693
Shouldn't we report it first?
What if we move without--

1104
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:14,489
Do you want someone else
to get the credit? Just go on.

1105
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:02,620
<i>Target spotted! Repeat, target spotted!</i>

1106
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:35,320
Around the back.
He's wearing workman's clothes.

1107
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,331
I swear he was here.

1108
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,001
-Damn it.
-Hey.

1109
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:51,461
Get up there.

1110
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:07,352
Where the fuck did he go?

1111
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,780
Confirm position of the target.

1112
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:21,533
<i>He's not here.</i>

1113
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:26,746
<i>Checking the area. He's not here.</i>

1114
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:31,709
Goddammit!

1115
01:25:41,052 --> 01:25:42,178
Damn it.

1116
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,119
<i>Get your asses up here. Now!</i>

1117
01:26:06,202 --> 01:26:07,495
For crying out loud.

1118
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:16,880
KIM JUNG-NAM

1119
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:24,762
I'm sorry, sir.

1120
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:40,028
Director!

1121
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,201
Did Mr. Kim evacuate to safety?

1122
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:48,745
<i>Yes. He managed to give them a slip.</i>

1123
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:51,289
Thank goodness for that.

1124
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,124
<i>He's taking refuge in
Hyanglim Church for now.</i>

1125
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,043
I know the place. I'll visit him there…

1126
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:56,252
<i>No, no…</i>

1127
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:57,212
I'm home.

1128
01:26:57,295 --> 01:27:00,256
<i>No, it'd be too risky for you
to contact him now.</i>

1129
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,507
Where is Mom?

1130
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:04,344
<i>Jung-nam's statement
will not have any effect</i>

1131
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:05,720
<i>without that information.</i>

1132
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,015
<i>-It's really important to have it.</i>
-Wait.

1133
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:12,310
<i>All our people are
under heavy surveillance.</i>

1134
01:27:13,269 --> 01:27:16,147
I'll find another way
to pass on the message.

1135
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:31,329
Yeon-hee.

1136
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:33,581
Yeon-hee!

1137
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:36,084
You scared me.

1138
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:39,295
What do you want?

1139
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:49,138
I'm not doing it.

1140
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:52,850
I swear this is the last time.

1141
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,727
It's important. He needs to see this.

1142
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,896
What's the point? Only you'll end up hurt.

1143
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,816
How can I do nothing
when there is something I can do?

1144
01:28:05,488 --> 01:28:08,241
I'm not alone in this.
There are people working together.

1145
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,327
Don't you know how my father died?

1146
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:15,957
All his colleagues ran away
at the first sign of trouble.

1147
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:19,168
He stood up for what was right.

1148
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:23,923
The company that didn't pay the wages
should be blamed, not the others.

1149
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:25,967
He didn't start drinking
because of the company.

1150
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:31,889
He drank because of the people
that betrayed him.

1151
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:33,891
Yeon-hee.

1152
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:37,895
It was an accident.

1153
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,772
It was no one's fault.

1154
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:41,649
Bullshit!

1155
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,903
If they hadn't abandoned him…

1156
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,703
he wouldn't have died.

1157
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:57,248
You can take this back.

1158
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:16,392
It's 250 won. You're 50-won short.

1159
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,069
Go on, have a good life.

1160
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,906
Careful, dears.

1161
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:33,409
Where is your uncle?

1162
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:34,535
I don't know.

1163
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:37,497
Byung-yong!

1164
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:41,042
Help me move the stalls inside.
It's going to rain tonight.

1165
01:29:44,587 --> 01:29:45,755
Did you two fight?

1166
01:29:45,838 --> 01:29:47,548
Of course not.

1167
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:54,013
How many times do I have to tell you?

1168
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:56,849
He's practically a father to you.

1169
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,727
Oh my god!

1170
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:02,188
-Byung-yong!
-Who are you people?

1171
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,107
You little rat!

1172
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:05,608
Byung-yong!

1173
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:07,360
-You fucking bitch!
-No, don't!

1174
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:11,114
-Get off me.
-Help!

1175
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,866
-Get off of me.
-Please!

1176
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,493
Come here.

1177
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:17,453
No, please stop. Byung-yong!

1178
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,668
-You fucking son of a bitch.
-Stop!

1179
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,003
What's going on?

1180
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,755
-I didn't do…
-Shut up!

1181
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,550
-Uncle!
-Take him!

1182
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:35,263
No!

1183
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:36,973
Search the place.

1184
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,685
Byung-yong!

1185
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,271
I'm okay. Don't worry.

1186
01:30:43,354 --> 01:30:44,480
-Uncle!
-Byung-yong!

1187
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:46,023
-Yeon-hee!
-Uncle!

1188
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,530
How can they do this?

1189
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,540
Did you see my men at the prison?

1190
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:06,627
I've seen them a couple of times.

1191
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:17,138
Do you know Kim Jung-nam?

1192
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:21,225
I don't know who that is.

1193
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:28,733
Kim Jung-nam received
money from Kim Il Sung

1194
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:31,527
and split it with the opposition leaders.

1195
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:34,697
Is that correct?

1196
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,783
I… don't know that man.

1197
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:46,334
KIM JUNG-NAM SPY RING

1198
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:01,182
I thought you didn't know
who I was talking about.

1199
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:04,852
Get him out of here.

1200
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:08,731
Two cushions?

1201
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:11,400
I'll show you how it's done.

1202
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:25,831
Goal!

1203
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,089
Let me tell you something.

1204
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:35,925
This room's got a history. A bad history.

1205
01:32:36,008 --> 01:32:38,678
So let's finish quickly
and walk out of here alive, okay?

1206
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:48,521
Evening papers!

1207
01:32:57,405 --> 01:33:01,534
CONFLICT AGAINST 4.13 STATEMENT
BETWEEN RULING AND OPPOSITION PARTY

1208
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:04,453
You live high up.

1209
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:14,297
Why did you come here?

1210
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:19,135
I came to recruit you, of course.

1211
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,054
Join our cartoon club.

1212
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,849
Jung-mi just joined too.

1213
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:31,314
We made this at the club.

1214
01:33:32,898 --> 01:33:34,483
APPEAL AGAINST DICTATORSHIP AND TORTURE

1215
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:43,743
Are you going to protest?

1216
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:51,083
You think you can change the world?

1217
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:55,671
Your ideal and dreams…
Don't you think about your family?

1218
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,348
"WHEN THE DAY COMES"

1219
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:08,059
No such day will come.

1220
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:12,438
Stop dreaming and wake up.

1221
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:18,527
I wish I could,

1222
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:23,240
but I can't.

1223
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:31,040
Because it hurts too much.

1224
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:37,546
You should go.

1225
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:49,266
See you.

1226
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:56,524
Yeon-hee!

1227
01:34:58,275 --> 01:35:00,069
Call me if you change your mind.

1228
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:38,482
CALL ME
THIS IS MY NUMBER!

1229
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,508
THIS IS THE LAST TIME.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

1230
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,343
FIND KIM JUNG-NAM AT HYANGLIM CHURCH

1231
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:19,982
Hello?

1232
01:36:20,065 --> 01:36:21,025
<i>Yeon-hee.</i>

1233
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:25,905
What's wrong, Mom? What happened?

1234
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:29,992
<i>Your uncle's been taken to Namyeong-dong
by the same people</i>

1235
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:32,786
<i>that killed that student.</i>

1236
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:36,957
That bastard won't give in.

1237
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,126
Can you do another round?

1238
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:46,300
We worked him over seven times,
and he still gave us nothing.

1239
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:48,552
He's a tenacious bastard, huh?

1240
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:49,887
Bring me his file.

1241
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:00,940
What's going on?

1242
01:37:05,027 --> 01:37:06,987
Get out of my way!

1243
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:09,281
I know he's here.

1244
01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:12,576
I'm here, Byung-yong!

1245
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:16,121
-Free them all!
-Your sister's here!

1246
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:18,958
-Free them all!
-Why do you hold them up there?

1247
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,251
Stop them.

1248
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,044
Give my brother back!

1249
01:37:22,127 --> 01:37:23,963
Keep these people out.

1250
01:37:25,839 --> 01:37:28,050
Are you all right?

1251
01:37:28,133 --> 01:37:29,176
My brother…

1252
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:30,886
Mom! You all right?

1253
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:34,557
How dare you hit her?

1254
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:39,103
What are you, some kind of thug?

1255
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:41,814
Mom, no!

1256
01:37:43,482 --> 01:37:46,402
How dare you hit her?

1257
01:37:51,156 --> 01:37:52,157
Mom!

1258
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:56,579
Yeon-hee!

1259
01:37:57,746 --> 01:37:59,081
Get inside!

1260
01:37:59,164 --> 01:38:01,125
-You can't do this!
-Yeon-hee!

1261
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:04,378
Mom!

1262
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:09,008
Shut up, you bitches!

1263
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:12,303
To positions!

1264
01:39:33,258 --> 01:39:34,718
HWAJEONG BARBERSHOP

1265
01:40:36,029 --> 01:40:37,322
Stop!

1266
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:38,949
Sir!

1267
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:50,169
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1268
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:05,434
One, two, three,

1269
01:41:05,517 --> 01:41:08,854
four, five, six.

1270
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:27,956
See this kid standing next to my mother?

1271
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,630
His name is Dong.

1272
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:40,636
We found him starving to death,
so my mother took him in.

1273
01:41:42,304 --> 01:41:45,182
He was a bright kid.

1274
01:41:46,141 --> 01:41:49,144
My father took to him like a son.

1275
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:53,690
He was like an older brother to me.

1276
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:02,783
But when Kim Il Sung came
into North Korea,

1277
01:42:03,992 --> 01:42:06,995
Dong got fascinated by
the idea of people's democracy

1278
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:09,790
and started participating in the movement.

1279
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:16,004
Do you know what he did to my family
in the name of the Red Army?

1280
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:20,175
He called us the enemy!

1281
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:22,594
Reactionaries and landowners!

1282
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,764
To be sent to Hell!

1283
01:42:29,184 --> 01:42:31,311
He stabbed my father with a bamboo spear

1284
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,066
saying he shouldn't

1285
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:40,195
waste bullets on him.

1286
01:42:41,363 --> 01:42:43,282
<i>-You son of a bitch!
-Honey!</i>

1287
01:42:43,365 --> 01:42:44,700
<i>Please… Honey!</i>

1288
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:50,539
I was hiding under the floor
but I saw the whole thing.

1289
01:42:50,622 --> 01:42:52,207
<i>-Please stop it!
-Kill them all!</i>

1290
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:53,792
Listen.

1291
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:58,630
If I tried to defend my family,
do you think I could have saved my mother?

1292
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:02,301
<i>-Dong, how could you!
-Mom!</i>

1293
01:43:02,384 --> 01:43:06,930
I could have saved my sister.
Because she died instead of me.

1294
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:09,558
<i>Brother!</i>

1295
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:16,815
Do you want to know

1296
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,236
what Hell is?

1297
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:27,367
It's someone murdering your family

1298
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:31,455
while you stand helplessly by and watch.

1299
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:35,083
Not able to make a sound.

1300
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,503
That's Hell.

1301
01:43:52,184 --> 01:43:53,185
What will you do?

1302
01:44:07,282 --> 01:44:08,659
<i>SUNDAY SEOUL</i>

1303
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:31,181
I'm sorry.

1304
01:44:32,391 --> 01:44:37,312
Please don't let them hurt my uncle.

1305
01:44:39,272 --> 01:44:41,191

-Run, hurry.
-But Pastor…

1317
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:09,654
Come on.

1318
01:46:16,661 --> 01:46:19,915
This is a place of God!
Violence will not be tolerated here.

1319
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:22,542
What are you doing?

1320
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,755
Where is Kim Jung-nam?

1321
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:46,983
Run!

1322
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:58,662
Get him!

KIM SEUNG-HOON, PRIEST
CATHOLIC PRIESTS' ASSOCIATION FOR JUSTICE

1329
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:59,431
The truth behind
the death of Park Jong-chul

1330
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,393
was covered up by authorities.

1331
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:08,273
The people responsible for
his murder by torturing him are in fact…

1332
01:48:09,733 --> 01:48:13,778
<i>Anti-communist Division 2-5-2,

<i>GOD AND LOVE</i>

Even if you die here,
no one will ever know.

1343
01:49:03,954 --> 01:49:05,330
So just tell us where he is.

1344
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:12,045
I really don't know.

1345
01:49:13,838 --> 01:49:15,423
I swear.

Looks like we'll hear the end of
our national anthem.

Fourth verse.

1348
01:49:23,181 --> 01:49:25,517
-Stop saying you don't know.
-Please…

No, please!

Get up, you bastard!

1351
01:49:31,147 --> 01:49:32,649

depends on this case.

Yes, sir.

-I have no idea.
-How can you not know?

1390
01:53:13,411 --> 01:53:16,748
-Is this part of a cover-up?
-I said I know nothing of it.

-The order came from above, didn't it?
-Shut up, you commie!

Any comments, Director?

1393

You paid the officers
100 million won to take the fall, right?

1394

I secured the families' testimonies.
