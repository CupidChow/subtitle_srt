1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,400
Long time no see, huh?

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,120
Recovery at the condo is boring.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,240
Why don't you come with me?

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>So, are you out on a date</i>
<i>now that he's out of the hospital?</i>

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,480
You like him already, don't you?

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,240
Sounds like you're trying
to warn me about something.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,000
<i>What are you really after?</i>

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,840
You applied to work with us

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,800
and got close to Sairung like that.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,160
If I find out your intentions
toward them aren't genuine,

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,040
the trust they have in you?

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,520
It'll be gone for good.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,280
And I've already made up my mind…

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,280
I'm going to try
winning Sairung's heart again.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,240
<i>You never run out of surprises.</i>

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,800
I like you so much.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,720
What's that?
You don't seem like Sairung.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Don't tell me…

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,640
You're not Sairung?

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,520
Marnmok!

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Hey!

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,320
I'm still enjoying it. What's with you?

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm worried about Sairung.

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,360
All right, what now?

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
What if Rung, Marn,
or all five of them really fall for Sun?

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,840
They'll end up like I did.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,760
They'll get their hearts broken,
just like me.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,080
I was about to tell her
the truth, you know.

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,040
Sis!

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,680
No, you can't tell her.

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,640
If you do, the money's gone.
My payment's gone.

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,880
I won't get paid.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,080
- Hey!
- Oi!

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm kidding.

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,160
Did you forget?

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,080
What we're doing will help Sairung recover
from her five personalities, right?

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,600
Aren't we doing this for her own good?

38
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
That's for Sairung.

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
But what about Sun?

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,000
What do you mean?

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,000
What if Sun really gets all five of them
to fall for him and love him?

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,880
Once Sairung gets better, then what?

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,200
He's just going to ditch them like he did
with the other girls and with me?

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,640
I don't know why,

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,200
but…

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,880
I think this time
it's going to be different.

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,600
It's not going to be like before.

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,280
What makes you so sure about that?

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,320
I think Sun's learned a lot
from this case.

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,960
He's faced things he's never faced before.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,480
He's done things he's never done before.

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,160
I think all of that
has changed how he feels.

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,280
I've worked with him for a long time,

54
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,960
so I kind of know how he is.

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,520
And I think

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,760
it's really different this time.

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,880
That goes for me too.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,360
What's that got to do with you?

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
Before this, when I worked with Sun,

60
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,600
I did my part.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,600
I rarely went out in the field with him.

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,840
It depended on the case
and who the target was.

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
The jobs were never so hard that
Sun couldn't handle them alone.

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,960
Until I came to work for this job.

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,960
I saw a side of the work
I'd never seen before.

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,160
What side?

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,360
The side that actually cares
how others might feel.

68
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,320
I'd never gone to see any of Sun's targets

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,200
until this job.

70
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
You mean Sairung?

71
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,560
I mean you, damn it, sis.

72
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,480
- Me?
- Yes.

73
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,920
I saw how you felt.

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,320
How much it hurt.

75
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,840
How hard you cried
when your heart was broken.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
That's when I started to realize

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,160
that what we've been doing
isn't really a good thing.

78
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,520
It's not a good thing

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
to use someone's heart as a tool
to make money like this.

80
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,680
It hurts them way more
than I ever imagined.

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,920
When I saw you suffering,

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,880
when I saw you cry,

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,080
I felt it too.

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,160
What did you feel?

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
I felt hurt along with you.

86
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
I believe

87
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,400
that Sun is also hurting
for having to do this.

88
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,200
And also,

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,320
do you remember that night?

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,720
Which night?

91
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,760
The night you were drunk.

92
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
I told you I didn't, didn't I?

93
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,480
That night I was wasted. Blackout.

94
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,800
I had a terrible hangover.

95
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,720
<i>It's as messy as what I'm saying, De.</i>

96
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,480
Stop that, De.

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Take it easy, De.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,280
Watch the whole thing, sis.

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,840
Or… are you starting to remember now?

100
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,680
Why do you even have this clip
in the first place?

101
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
You're my boyfriend from this second on.

102
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Once she's sober,
she won't even remember this moment.

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
But I've got proof now.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,640
That day, I was just
testing some equipment.

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,960
I thought I'd try it out.

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,520
I only meant to use it for fun.

107
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,080
But I ended up with a pretty good clip.

108
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
It really is a good one.

109
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,320
Ready to watch it all the way through?

110
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,360
<i>By being my boyfriend?</i>

111
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,080
<i>Yes.</i>

112
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,320
<i>You gonna fix my broken heart?</i>

113
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,280
<i>I think I do.</i>

114
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440
<i>You're my boyfriend from this second on.</i>

115
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,080
You were too drunk to remember, right?

116
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,160
Who said I didn't remember?

117
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
Even if I was drunk, I remember.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,640
You never had your nails done before?

119
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,360
I haven't.

120
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,480
Do you get yours done often?

121
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,640
Not that often.

122
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,920
I just think the beauty-and-glam stuff
really suits Sairung.

123
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Why?

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,680
You hate how confident I am or something?

125
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,800
Which one do you want?

126
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,160
But this one is cute too.

127
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,400
This one here. This, this.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,640
Why is it acting up?

129
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Hey, look.

130
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,440
It's stuck.

131
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,400
What are you doing?

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,920
Want to go first?

133
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,800
- Me first?
- Yeah.

134
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,440
I'm really surprised

135
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,000
to see all these unexpected sides of you,
and so many of them too.

136
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,320
"Unexpected"? "So many"?

137
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,200
Isn't it though?

138
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,120
Tom Yum noodles,

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,680
cafés,

140
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,360
blind boxing, punching,

141
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,400
and now this chill walk.

142
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
It feels like I got to date
all of you girls at once.

143
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,800
Sairung,

144
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,840
Prai-Fon, Storm, and Fahsai.

145
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,720
Seriously,

146
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,799
they're all the same person.

147
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,080
The ones who've been with you are all me.

148
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,640
So the one walking with me right now is…?

149
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,000
Marnmok…

150
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,600
Marnmok has her chill side too.

151
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,800
But she gets scared easily.

152
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,960
She's scared of losing something again.

153
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,240
You wouldn't understand.

154
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,320
Losing?

155
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,240
Your new target?

156
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,160
Mr. Heartbreaker.

157
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,240
You asshole, Sun!

158
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,840
Don't you remember your uni friend?

159
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,640
Or should I say uni "wife"?

160
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,200
You're drinking yogurt now?

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,920
- What for?
- For my own good.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,720
If I don't love myself,
how can I love anyone else?

163
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,000
You drink it too.

164
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,880
Take it.

165
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,920
So…

166
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,080
do you remember that night now?

167
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,200
Which one?

168
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,440
Seriously, sis.
You're really leaving me hanging here.

169
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,640
You can't just play dumb all of a sudden.

170
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,640
That last thing you said back there is…

171
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,760
"Who said I didn't remember?"

172
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
"Even if I was drunk, I remember."

173
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,640
What now, sis? Are you going to
leave me hanging like this?

174
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,160
What else do you want me to say?

175
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,600
Anything. Just don't leave
me hanging like this.

176
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
I remember what I did.

177
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,720
But I don't remember how I felt.

178
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm not drunk now.

179
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,920
Let me try again.

180
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,280
I'm Gale.

181
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,240
I was his friend in college.

182
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,600
Then we gradually became a couple.

183
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,760
- And after that--
- Hi, Gale.

184
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,440
Been a while, huh?

185
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,320
How about I call you later?

186
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,280
It's not a good time right now.

187
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,880
I was his friend in college.

188
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,080
We went out together too.

189
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,360
He tricked me into going
to his room. Then…

190
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,960
Here's the story.

191
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,000
That girl was dating my friend.

192
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,280
She liked to flirt a lot. She was seeing
a bunch of guys at the same time.

193
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,720
The worst part was that
she even tried to flirt with me.

194
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,160
So my friend asked me for a favor.

195
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,120
To…

196
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,680
To go out with her and then ditch her.

197
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,080
And you did that?

198
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,280
I was young.

199
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,080
I didn't really think it through.

200
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,920
Are you dating him?

201
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,480
- No, I'm not.
- Good.

202
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,160
You should stay away from him.

203
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,720
He's a total asshole.

204
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,640
Nail and bail.

205
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,120
What are you talking about, Gale?

206
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,160
Stop making stuff up.

207
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,840
- He'll do the same to you too.
- Gale.

208
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,720
I admit I was wrong.

209
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,280
I shouldn't have done that to you.

210
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,400
So what, Sun?

211
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,680
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,600
It's been years.
Isn't it too late to say sorry now?

213
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,760
I know it's too late.

214
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,640
And it doesn't make you feel better.

215
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,520
But I really meant what I said.

216
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,360
I really am sorry.

217
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,680
Blaming him now

218
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,280
won't fix anything, right?

219
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,040
If he's still that kind of guy,

220
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,080
he'll face the consequences,
like what happened today.

221
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,200
I think you should forgive him.

222
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,960
Okay.

223
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,120
If you think Sun's not like that anymore.

224
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,800
Be careful though.

225
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,840
Oh, gosh.

226
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,280
Bro…

227
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,760
I'll take care of this myself.

228
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,320
Whoa.

229
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
How did she appear?

230
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,480
Are you mad at me?

231
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,520
What kind of guy are you, really?

232
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm just an ordinary guy.

233
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
I've made bad decisions many times.

234
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,440
I've done plenty of bad things.

235
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,640
I get mad, frustrated…

236
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,400
I've messed up a lot too.

237
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,520
But…

238
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,280
The sun has several shades,

239
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,800
like a rainbow.

240
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,680
What do you think of us?

241
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,080
What do I think of you?

242
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,840
With you…

243
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,440
I find that you're intriguing.

244
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
You've always kept me on my toes.

245
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,760
With Fahsai,

246
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,160
just like her name suggests,

247
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,400
Fahsai is bright, like a clear sky.

248
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,400
I feel at ease when I'm with her.

249
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,520
As for Prai-Fon,

250
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,320
she's like a true partner.

251
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,640
I can open up to her about anything.

252
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,600
And Storm,
we're like two dudes hanging out.

253
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,840
She seems tough,

254
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,080
but deep down,

255
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,000
she's fragile.

256
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,040
I want to take care of her.

257
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,880
As for…

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,880
Marnmok.

259
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,520
A girl like Marnmok…

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,520
What do you think of her?

261
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,280
Don't tell me…

262
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,320
You're not Sairung?

263
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,080
Marnmok!

264
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,240
Don't tell anyone, I beg you.

265
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,680
I want to test Sun about something.

266
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,600
All right.

267
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,440
What about Marnmok?

268
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,040
What do you think of her?

269
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,040
I'm afraid…

270
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,280
afraid I won't be sincere enough for her,

271
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,200
and I'll end up hurting her.

272
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,880
Why?

273
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,520
Marnmok may seem intimidating

274
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,560
and serious,

275
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,400
but actually,

276
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,280
deep down, she's just like any other girl.

277
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,280
She wants love too.

278
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,520
It's just that
her past has made her scared.

279
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,680
Scared of getting hurt.

280
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,920
That's why she shut the door on me.

281
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,400
The only way I can open that door

282
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
is with sincerity.

283
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,360
But I'm afraid that

284
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,280
the sincerity I have for her

285
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,440
might not be enough for someone like her.

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,520
I don't think there's such a thing…

287
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,040
as "enough" or "not enough."

288
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,560
What Marnmok wants is sincerity.

289
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,880
That's all.

290
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,360
Are you being sincere or not?

291
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
Can I ask for a chance?

292
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,400
Let me be your love.

293
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,960
I can't speak for everyone.

294
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,000
They'll have to answer you themselves.

295
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,160
I'll wait.

296
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,200
I mean…

297
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,880
I'll let everyone answer you right now.

298
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,000
Right now?

299
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,760
Fahsai.

300
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,120
Spending time doing fun things with you

301
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,920
and having someone who listens and cares

302
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,600
feels really nice.

303
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,840
With you…

304
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,360
I feel warm inside.

305
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,000
I can't see you.

306
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,800
Can you see me now, Prai-Fon?

307
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,840
Hey!

308
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,240
You coming into my life
has brought so much more color to it.

309
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,080
You helped me
see the world in a new light.

310
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,400
Let's fly out of the book together.

311
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,920
Is your wound still hurting?

312
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

313
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,720
Hey,

314
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,560
you're out of the hospital now.

315
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,520
- Let's fight this together.
- Sure thing, bro.

316
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,320
- Hey!
- Ouch.

317
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Sairung.

318
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,320
How are you doing?

319
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,560
Are you going to be my love?

320
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,800
Are you sure about what you said?

321
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,520
How broken everyone could be
if we end up getting hurt again…

322
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
You realize that, don't you?

323
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,080
Marnmok.

324
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,600
TRUTH TODAY SCHEDULE

325
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,880
TRUTH EXPOSED!! IT MAY
NOT HAVE BEEN A FIRE

326
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,920
SPORTS DAY, 3RD GRADE

327
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,160
SAIRUNG, PIANO CLASS
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

328
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,320
<i>How long have you been working</i>
<i>for Kritsana Real Estate?</i>

329
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,120
<i>I'm entering my seventh year this year.</i>

330
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,920
<i>What's your responsibility?</i>

331
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,160
<i>I work in project development.</i>

332
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,440
<i>My main responsibility is land management.</i>

333
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,400
These are all key pieces of evidence.

334
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,400
If this info gets exposed,

335
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,040
those parasites at Kritsana Real Estate
are going down for sure.

336
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,320
You hired me to go after your daughter.

337
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,640
But instead, I found her

338
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,960
digging into Kritsana Real Estate.

339
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,440
I know you're hiding something from me.

340
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,760
Are you getting yourself
into something dangerous?

341
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,800
If you are, step back right now.

342
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>If you don't have the guts to do it, fine.</i>
<i>I can take care of myself.</i>

343
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,440
I'm sleepy.

344
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,280
I barely got any sleep either.

345
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
What kept you up?

346
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,440
Well, well.

347
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,720
Look who shows up right at lunchtime.

348
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,920
Are you staff or management, I wonder?

349
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,880
Oh.

350
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,000
Should we just call in sick, bro?

351
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,960
It's good that you're here.

352
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,520
Let's grab lunch first.

353
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,960
I'll brief you while we eat.

354
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,160
You'll be working with me outside
this afternoon.

355
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,960
Me?

356
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,680
Oh.

357
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,680
Yes.

358
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,040
Let's have lunch first.

359
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,280
I want to eat Tom Yum noodles.

360
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,840
Lunch time!

361
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,200
Let's go.

362
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Hey, Gudji.

363
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,000
Where's the black 2TB hard disk?

364
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,040
I was about to look for some files
from last year.

365
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,560
I'm pretty sure they're in there.

366
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,400
But I'm hungry.

367
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,720
Uh… it's on my desk.
Go help yourself.

368
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,520
- Don't get the wrong one.
- Okay.

369
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,680
I'm going for lunch now.

370
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,480
What the hell is this?

371
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,360
Just say it already. Cat got your tongue?

372
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,640
I'm updating someone
on their feelings here,

373
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,880
not work.

374
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,000
It's not easy to put into words, you know.

375
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,600
Why don't you just say
every girl's already fallen for you?

376
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,760
Only Marnmok's left.

377
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,880
What? Is that true?

378
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,880
All four already fell for you?

379
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,200
If I'm not wrong,

380
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,200
it seems like it.

381
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,120
But Mr. Theppachai.
I don't think this is going to work.

382
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,960
How can you be sure
that if Marnmok falls for me too,

383
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,120
all five personalities
will merge into one?

384
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,880
Yeah.

385
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,400
I never thought about that until now.

386
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
That's right. You've got a point.

387
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,120
What, bro?

388
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,880
Look.

389
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,560
I think we should call this off.

390
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,720
I don't want to mess
with people's feelings anymore.

391
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,360
So now you truly understand,

392
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,840
Mr. Love Karma.

393
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
All four of them seem to like me.

394
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,840
Marnmok seems to be opening up too.

395
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,840
Hey.

396
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,400
If Marnmok's opening her heart,
and you can win her over,

397
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,920
we'll finally know if my daughter
can overcome this condition.

398
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't think so.

399
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,680
The more Marnmok opens up,

400
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,920
the more I'm afraid.

401
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,400
What now, seriously?

402
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,560
I'm afraid I'll end up hurting her.

403
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,400
I feel I'm not good enough
to earn Marnmok's love.

404
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,200
The room's suddenly overflowing
with your handsome vibe, bro.

405
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,720
Sun, I'm giving you just ten minutes.

406
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,720
We should head out now.

407
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,960
Okay.

408
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,040
Don't go just yet, Marn.

409
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,400
I've got something I want you to see.

410
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,840
<i>He knows exactly what I like.</i>
<i>The type I'm weak for.</i>

411
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,200
<i>Feels like he was made to be</i>
<i>my perfect match.</i>

412
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,400
<i>Makes me fall in just a few days.</i>

413
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,240
<i>And in the end,</i>
<i>I fell right into his trap.</i>

414
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,680
<i>It's a send-off.</i>

415
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,400
<i>It's exhausting having to do all this</i>
<i>just to please you.</i>

416
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,920
<i>You know the standards you've set,</i>

417
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,400
<i>they're too high for real life.</i>

418
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,600
<i>I'm hurt.</i>

419
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,400
<i>I'm so pissed. I'm mad.</i>

420
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,520
<i>I want revenge.</i>

421
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,400
<i>He knows exactly what I like.</i>
<i>The type I'm weak for.</i>

422
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,080
What do you all want?

423
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,680
What's the point of all this?

424
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,960
If there's any way to help you get better,
I have to take it.

425
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,800
By hiring someone to toy with me?

426
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,760
<i>He knows exactly what I like.</i>
<i>The type I'm weak for.</i>

427
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,320
<i>Feels like he was made to be</i>
<i>my perfect match.</i>

428
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,040
<i>Makes me fall in just a few days.</i>

429
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,600
<i>And in the end,</i>
<i>I fell right into his trap.</i>

430
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,120
Making people fall in just a few days…

431
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,000
That's why you couldn't answer

432
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,480
whether you were being sincere or not.

433
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,720
What Marnmok wants is sincerity.

434
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,480
That's all.

435
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,360
Are you being sincere or not?

436
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,000
Let me ask you again.

437
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,400
Are you going to be sincere
with all five of us?

438
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,680
You asked me to update you

439
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,000
on how many of your daughter's
personalities I've made fall for me.

440
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,840
I couldn't answer you right away

441
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,720
because I'm not even sure anymore

442
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,840
if I'm still working for you.

443
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,920
What I felt on the first day…

444
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,160
isn't the same as what I feel now.

445
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,320
At this point…

446
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,720
I don't feel like I'm doing this
out of duty to you anymore.

447
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,360
I'm doing it for myself.

448
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,760
Getting to know all five of them…

449
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,040
I did that for me.

450
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,480
Doing everything to make
all five of them happy…

451
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
I did that for me.

452
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,120
Making all five them fall in love…

453
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,600
I did that for me too.

454
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,800
But I don't think
you can call this job done just yet.

455
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,000
Because for it to really be over,

456
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,000
you'd have to ditch me

457
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,560
and collect your payment.

458
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,720
But this time,

459
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,880
I'm the one ditching you first.

460
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,240
Dad,

461
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,920
these new employees you hired
didn't pass probation.

462
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,880
Now pack up and leave the office.

463
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,920
"THE HEARTBREAKER FOR HIRE"

464
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,600
Bro. There's still some stuff left.

465
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,400
I'll go grab it for you. You should rest.

466
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,760
Hey, my little bro De.

467
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,560
You left some stuff behind.

468
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,960
Your way of flirting, huh?

469
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,080
Come on, sis.

470
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,200
Who's even in the mood
to flirt with you right now?

471
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,880
How's Sun doing?

472
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,120
I think he's about to jump soon.

473
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,160
What?

474
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,840
He's quite a mess.

475
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,240
I'm right here, all right?

476
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,680
I'm right here.

477
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,680
When you smile, you light up.

478
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,400
Why are you so up in my business?

479
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,600
I'm just worried.

480
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,159
- Sun. Sun!
- Sun!

481
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,639
Sun! Sun! Sun!

482
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,560
Sun!

483
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,000
How broken everyone could be
if we end up getting hurt again…

484
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,960
You realize that, do you?

485
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Whenever you feel insecure,
just fold your arms like that.

486
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,920
Does that make you feel warm?

487
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,960
It's pretty warm.

488
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,200
Hey. Hurry up and get better already.

489
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,240
Storm.

490
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,040
I won't run from anyone again.

491
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,960
I'll fly with you.

492
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,080
Sun…

493
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,200
What exactly are you doing?

494
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,040
<i>In all the time I've known Sun, I've never</i>
<i>seen him act this way with anyone.</i>

495
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,160
I think he's confused.

496
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,920
His job is all about deceiving…

497
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,720
but what he did here

498
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,360
came from real feelings.

499
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,560
And those feelings
were really, really sincere, sis.

500
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,120
Are you being sincere or not?

501
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,880
<i>Let me ask you again.</i>

502
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,720
Are you going to be sincere
with all five of us?

503
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,080
<i>But this time,</i>

504
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,120
I'm the one ditching you first.

505
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,680
Now pack up and leave the office.

506
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,520
You do know that Sairung isn't normal.

507
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,600
I have to try anything that could
help my daughter, don't I?

508
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,880
Are you out of your mind?

509
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,080
You really think doing this
will make Sairung go back to normal?

510
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,600
You're not her father.
What would you understand?

511
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,480
Tell me honestly.

512
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,200
Before your wife died, you didn't
have a fight with her, did you?

513
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,680
Why do you know so much?

514
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,240
Honey, wake up.

515
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,240
Marn.

516
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,120
<i>I need your help.</i>

517
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,680
No. Don't be joking.

518
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,560
I'm not joking.
