1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,000
Can I ask for a chance?

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,640
I've got something I want you to see.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,440
SCAMMER!!
WITH A BRAND-NEW TRICK!!

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,640
You asked me to update you

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,960
on how many of your daughter's
personalities I've made fall for me.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,560
I don't feel like I'm doing this
out of duty to you anymore.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,200
I'm doing it for myself.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,800
Making all five them fall in love…

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
I did that for me too.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,920
But I don't think
you can call this job done just yet.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Because for it to really be over,

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
you'd have to ditch me
and collect your payment.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,000
But this time,

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm the one ditching you first.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,280
<i>I think he's confused.</i>

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,400
But what he did here
came from real feelings.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,720
What exactly are you doing?

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,040
HAVING YOU, EVEN IF I'M SCARED,
I WON'T BE FIGHTING ALONE ANYMORE.

19
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
Oopsies!

20
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,520
Have you been waiting long?

21
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,080
What kind of greeting is that?

22
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,000
Here.

23
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,280
Thank you!

24
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
How's the unemployed life treating you?

25
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,360
Lonely, obviously.

26
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm seriously feeling lonely without work.

27
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,120
Ever since that day,

28
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,720
I haven't spoken with Sun.

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
He's been radio silent. He's probably
trying to put himself back together.

30
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,920
Then why not get back on
that heartbreaker gig of yours?

31
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,640
Come on, sis.

32
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm done with it.

33
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,000
I quit. I'm out for good.

34
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
Sun and I are done with this.

35
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,120
Besides, I don't think Sun
ever wants to go back to it.

36
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,120
This case has probably shut down
his heartbreaker-for-hire for good.

37
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,720
Yeah, it was a rough ending, right?

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
But it's for the best.

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
This career is really not right.

40
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,520
Got it. I'm not going back.

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,800
By the way, did you get the payment?
Mr. Theppachai asked me to check.

42
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,760
It showed up.

43
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,160
He paid us in full,

44
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,680
even though
we couldn't actually finish the job.

45
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,640
I feel kinda weird about taking it though.

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,760
Come on. Just take it.

47
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,800
Think of it as your retirement bonus
from your scammer life.

48
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,920
So, what's Sun up to?

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,480
Yeah, I don't know either.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,880
Hey, Mike.

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,680
- Are you shutting down the business?
- Whoa, charmer.

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,920
You trying to jinx me
the second you show up?

53
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,400
I saw you moving stuff. Thought you were
moving out from this place.

54
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,800
Come on, Sun.

55
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
I run a gallery.

56
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,520
I've got to renovate it once in a while.

57
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Anyway, what's up?

58
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,160
You came all the way to see me.
What can I do for you?

59
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,960
Shit, you quit?

60
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,000
That means you're closing the chapter
on Mr. Sun, the pick-up artist.

61
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,040
Yeah.

62
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,400
That last job drained the hell out of me.

63
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,680
And I couldn't even finish it.

64
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,040
She must've been one of a kind.

65
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,560
Right?

66
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,440
Let's not talk about it.

67
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,040
So that means

68
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
you can start taking on
photography gigs again.

69
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,360
That's why I'm here.

70
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,360
I want to use your gallery
for my exhibition.

71
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,640
Whoa. Now we're talking.

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,640
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you to say that?

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,520
How about we clink glasses
for both things tonight?

74
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,520
It's on me.

75
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,560
I can't today.

76
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,480
I've got plans with another woman.

77
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,400
What?

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,240
Didn't you just say you quit? Huh?

79
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,240
Who are you,
and what did you do with my mom?

80
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,560
Give my mom back now.

81
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,200
Have you lost it?

82
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,920
I'm still your mom.

83
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,040
Just an upgraded version, that's all.

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,000
An upgrade should be faster
and more efficient.

85
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,600
Why do you seem slower?

86
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,040
This upgrade comes with
a deeper understanding of the world.

87
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,240
Have you also updated to a new version?

88
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,240
Or is the update completely frozen?
Is that why you came to see me?

89
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,000
It's frozen.

90
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,400
The system's totally messed up.

91
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,120
What caused it?

92
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,360
Love.

93
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,400
Seriously, Mom.
Even this alone is too much for me.

94
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,320
Come on.

95
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,600
Drink this instead.

96
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
Beer just makes you fat.

97
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,880
If you get too drunk, just crash here.

98
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,120
Mom.

99
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,120
You're trying to get a man
to stay over again.

100
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
That's harsh, you little brat.

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,600
But like I care.

102
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,160
Actually, my life's
been frozen lately too.

103
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,520
<i>I just lived life at my own pace.</i>

104
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
<i>I did my job.</i>

105
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,360
<i>I did everything I could to make a living.</i>

106
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,680
Then I had you.

107
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,680
I still believe

108
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,000
that living with
no strings attached is easier.

109
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,000
<i>True love might be real,</i>

110
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,720
<i>but it's hard to find.</i>

111
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,120
<i>I ran into it after all.</i>

112
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,720
<i>That same look in a boy's eyes…</i>

113
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,039
<i>I saw you.</i>

114
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
<i>I saw what you were feeling.</i>

115
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,960
<i>I saw your pain.</i>

116
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,640
<i>I saw my own son's heart.</i>

117
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,280
All this time,
I never wanted to get attached.

118
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,520
I never wanted
to settle down or fall in love.

119
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,640
Maybe I never knew
what real love felt like.

120
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,880
But now I know…

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,240
pure love does exist.

122
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,000
And you're only realizing at this age?

123
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,920
The world changes,
and so does how we see life.

124
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,520
When you get older, you start to
understand things more clearly.

125
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,920
Sun.

126
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
And this love you mentioned,

128
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,040
what did it do to you?

129
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,000
It didn't do anything,

130
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,840
I just don't know how to handle it.

131
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,960
It's simple.

132
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,080
Just be sincere.

133
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,680
That's all it takes.

134
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,120
That terrarium thing looks fun.

135
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,720
Can I try?

136
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,960
Why not?

137
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,960
Hey, are you drunk?

138
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,920
I'm drunk.

139
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,280
I'm staying here with you tonight.

140
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,720
Liar.

141
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
Where should I put it? Here?

142
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
It sucks.

143
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
The office has been way too quiet lately.

144
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,280
I nearly thought we'd shut down the page.
There are no updates. No one's working.

145
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,600
What?

146
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
What about Boss Thep?

147
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
He hasn't shown up at all.

148
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,360
I haven't seen him for days.

149
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,680
When I asked, he said he was on vacation.

150
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,560
Vacation?

151
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,880
What about Marnmok?

152
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,800
Yeah, she seems busy.

153
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,000
I keep seeing her with Pat.

154
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,800
It seems their full attention
is on the Kritsana case.

155
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,040
I don't see how they're gonna find
evidence against someone that powerful.

156
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
- They might already have something.
- Huh?

157
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
After the truth came out that day,
Boss Thep spilled quite a lot.

158
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,160
What did he spill?

159
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,880
You do know that Sairung isn't normal.

160
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,240
I have to help my daughter.

161
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,560
If you don't want to help me,
at least think of Sairung.

162
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,880
Are you out of your mind?

163
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,520
You really think doing this
will make Sairung go back to normal?

164
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,240
It's you who should think of Sairung.

165
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,200
I have to try anything that could
help my daughter, don't I?

166
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,600
You're not her father.
What would you understand?

167
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,360
Then look at her now.

168
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,520
Is she getting better or worse?

169
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,800
Think carefully.

170
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
What caused all this to happen to Sairung?

171
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,360
When did it begin?

172
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,840
It was after…

173
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,480
after her mom died, right?

174
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,200
My wife is dead.

175
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,400
What do you expect me to do?

176
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,120
Uncover the truth.

177
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,160
Sairung never believed that
her mom took her own life.

178
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,200
What's the truth? Tell your daughter.

179
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,480
Pornnapa took her own life.

180
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
What more do you want to hear?

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,960
Are you sure you're not hiding something?

182
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,000
It was all over the news.

183
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,680
Kritsana Real Estate
has been tied to shady business.

184
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,840
What does that have to do with Sairung?

185
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
Tell me honestly.

186
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,960
Hasn't it ever crossed your mind

187
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,720
that your wife might've been silenced?

188
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,480
Before your wife died,

189
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
you didn't have a fight with her, did you?

190
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,800
Why do you know so much?

191
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,200
Your wife died from an overdose
because of an affair? Really?

192
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,760
Did she have an affair?

193
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,880
Who was it with? Tell me.

194
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,800
Who on earth told you all this?

195
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,600
Did your wife really kill herself,
Boss Thep?

196
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
Yes! But that's only partly true.

197
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
"Partly true?"

198
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,200
What does that mean?

199
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,080
Why does this concern you?

200
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,880
Stop grilling me already.

201
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,080
Wait, boss.

202
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,320
You're fired,

203
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,920
for stepping out of line in your role
as a news producer.

204
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,840
If it were me asking,

205
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,040
it wouldn't be out of line, would it?

206
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,720
"Partly true."

207
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,840
What does that mean, Dad?

208
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,480
What I believe

209
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,200
is true, right?

210
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,360
Mom didn't kill herself.

211
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,640
And you know it's connected
to Kritsana Real Estate.

212
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,520
That big fight between you and Mom
before she died…

213
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,400
What was it really about?

214
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,840
Say something, Dad!

215
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,720
Don't be a coward.

216
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,280
You're a journalist. Tell the truth!

217
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,720
Sairung, your mom didn't kill herself.

218
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,880
But I don't want you
to get involved in this anymore.

219
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,480
I lost your mother.

220
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,520
I can't lose you too.

221
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,800
She didn't kill herself?

222
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,400
Then how did she die?

223
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,840
Pat, that's enough.

224
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,120
What about the affair?
What was that really about?

225
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Pat. Enough.

226
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,600
An affair?

227
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,720
Mom… had an affair?

228
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,360
Your mom…

229
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,800
She got hold of evidence

230
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,200
that she wasn't supposed to see.

231
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,040
What evidence?

232
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,960
- Please, sweetie. Stay out of it.
- Where's the evidence?

233
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,960
- Stop before this gets out of control.
- Stop being a coward, boss!

234
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
Where is it? Answer me!

235
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,640
I burned it all!

236
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,960
That's not true.

237
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,720
Hey.

238
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,120
Be careful, okay?

239
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,560
We're all worried about you.

240
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,800
I think Sun needs to know about this.

241
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm scared history will repeat itself.

242
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,120
Go ahead and tell him.

243
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,840
Bring him in to stop Marnmok.

244
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,080
It's Sun.

245
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,600
Hello, bro!

246
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,120
My lovely brother Sun,
where have you been?

247
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,400
You fool! You perv!

248
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,720
<i>De, have you seen Gudji lately?</i>

249
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,760
Yes, I'm actually with her right now. Why?

250
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,160
<i>Good. Once I wrap things up here,</i>
<i>I'll go see you. Send me your location.</i>

251
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,960
I've got something
to talk to you about too.

252
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,440
Where are you going again?

253
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,960
<i>I need to fix my past.</i>

254
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,880
Wait, Sun.

255
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,000
Now's not the time to fix your past.
Focus on the present first.

256
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,400
Things are getting really messy right now.

257
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,760
Marnmok just found a new lead
about her mom.

258
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,440
Shit, who's she with right now?

259
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,880
Who's Marnmok with?

260
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Pat.

261
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,839
<i>It's Pat, bro.</i>

262
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,160
Hey, did you ask me here
just to watch you talk on the phone?

263
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
Sorry, just give me a sec.

264
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,800
She should be safe, then.

265
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,240
I'll go see you once I'm done here.

266
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,160
I would like to apologize,

267
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
whether you forgive me or not.

268
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,040
I truly am sorry…

269
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,880
For everything that happened to you,
I'm really, truly sorry.

270
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,400
Trying to fix your past, huh?
Isn't it a little too late?

271
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,000
It's been a while, Sun.
Have you been doing well?

272
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
That night, I left in a rush.

273
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,840
But now, I'm not in a rush.

274
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,520
I've quit.

275
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,560
I won't go back to doing
such a thing again.

276
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,680
It's been years.

277
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,000
If you really feel guilty and know what
you did wrong, good for you.

278
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,760
I'm really sorry.

279
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,920
If you're looking for forgiveness…
of course, I'll give that to you.

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,480
But this is how women forgive, Sun.

281
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,680
You nasty little shit!

282
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,080
Okay. I don't hold any grudges now.

283
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,000
It's settled between us.

284
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,440
I forgive you.

285
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,760
You should move on now.

286
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,440
I moved on long ago.

287
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,120
But there was more to it.

288
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,720
I…

289
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,920
got paid for what I did.

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,840
Someone hired you?

291
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,320
I can't say who.

292
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,600
It's not hard to guess.

293
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,800
But, Sun.

294
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,600
What am I supposed to feel toward you now?

295
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,840
You believed them
and thought I was the one at fault?

296
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,640
So you took their money
to come after me for revenge?

297
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,720
Let me ask you this.

298
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,520
How does love begin?

299
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,640
It begins with two people, right?

300
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,600
They meet, flirt, fall in love, make love,
and everything that comes with it.

301
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,120
But when they break up,

302
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,720
do you really think
one person can end it alone?

303
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,680
Do you think only one side is to blame?

304
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,880
Love…

305
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,080
starts with two people.

306
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
If it has to come to an end,

307
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
it's because of both of them.

308
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,280
It's never just one person's fault, Sun.

309
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,360
If I'd met you sooner,
I would've tried to win you over for real.

310
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,360
Enough, Sun.

311
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
Don't mess with me again.

312
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,880
Got it.

313
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,040
And don't do this kind of thing
to anyone else ever again.

314
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,240
Love only happens when it's sincere.

315
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,600
Do you know that?

316
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,880
I'm heading out now.

317
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,840
Marn.

318
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,440
Your mother's room is upstairs, right?

319
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,800
Yes.

320
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Let's go.

321
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,520
Honey.

322
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,760
Honey.

323
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,960
Honey.

324
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,440
Honey, no!

325
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,640
Honey.

326
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,200
No one can help you except yourself.

327
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,920
Hello. I've got an injured person here.
It's an emergency.

328
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,800
Please hurry!

329
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,280
I don't know what happened to her.
Please hurry.

330
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,240
Marn.

331
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880
Let's start searching the room.

332
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,840
Okay.

333
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,200
You check that wardrobe.

334
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,160
I'll take care of this one.

335
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,520
- Thanks a lot.
- All right.

336
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

337
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,960
Where are you?

338
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,280
Okay.

339
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,560
Sun!

340
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
My dear bro, Sun!

341
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Gudji.

342
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,520
I'm sorry

343
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,520
for what I did to you.

344
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,680
I've quit that job.

345
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,280
I'm done with breaking hearts for money.

346
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,920
I really am sorry.

347
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,280
What happened to your face?

348
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,400
Whoa, bro.

349
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,240
Is this what you'd call fixing the past?

350
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,920
Oh, you must have gotten slapped
multiple times to get this red.

351
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,600
I was gonna slap you too
to teach you a lesson.

352
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,600
But seeing your face now…

353
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,920
One more slap
and it might actually explode.

354
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,720
I truly am sorry.

355
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,120
You do it too!

356
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,080
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I won't do it again.

357
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,920
Fine. Just forget it.

358
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,280
I'm a kind-hearted woman.
Forgiveness isn't that hard for me.

359
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,200
Ptooey!

360
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,240
Oh, sis.

361
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
By the way, bro.

362
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,040
What's the plan with Marnmok?

363
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
I called her on the way here.

364
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,080
Looks like she blocked my number.

365
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,720
She didn't pick up mine either.

366
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,440
She simply cut mine off too.

367
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,480
Damn, what do we do now?

368
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,400
Oi, what do we do?

369
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,280
Hello? Is Marnmok with you?

370
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,920
She's safe, right?

371
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,200
Where are you two now?

372
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,840
What? You won't tell me?

373
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
Fine, if that's how you want it.

374
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
At least I know she's safe.

375
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,080
Okay, fine.

376
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,080
Bye-bye.

377
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,840
Sis, who were you talking to? Fill me in.

378
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,040
It was Pat.

379
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,560
I told you, didn't I? Marn went with Pat.

380
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,560
I couldn't reach Marn,
so I called him instead.

381
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,720
He picked up. That's it.

382
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,120
Why didn't you tell us?

383
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,880
What? Do I have to?

384
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,160
Anyway, Marn's fine now.
No need to worry. Okay?

385
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,560
Where are Marnmok and Pat now?

386
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,560
Not telling.

387
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,040
Why? Why can't you tell us?
Why keep it to yourself?

388
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,200
Pat didn't tell me,
it's not that I'm keeping it from you.

389
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,120
She's safe, that's what matters.

390
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,000
Gosh.

391
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,280
He kept it to himself, not me.

392
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,720
REAL-ESTATE TYCOON
DENIES ALL ALLEGATIONS

393
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,840
Did you find anything?

394
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,080
Look at this, Pat.

395
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,480
KRITSANA SWEEPS UP PRIME LAND! UNVEILS
NEW PROJECTS WORTH 47.7 MILLION BAHT

396
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,360
This news is all about Kritsana.

397
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,280
REAL ESTATE TYCOON LINKED TO
SECRET AFFAIR WITH FORMER ACTRESS

398
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,560
"O"?

399
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,600
"K". Kritsana?

400
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,480
K? O??

401
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,560
REAL ESTATE TYCOON LINKED TO
SECRET AFFAIR WITH FORMER ACTRESS

402
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,360
BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN INVOLVED WITH
FORMER ACTRESS ON-ANONG JIRAKAN,

403
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,080
RUMORED TO BE KEPT AS A MISTRESS.
MEDIA SHUT OUT.

404
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Here, this is On-Anong.

405
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,040
But insiders say she was silenced.

406
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,160
Was she… killed?

407
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,760
FORMER ACTRESS SUSPECTED OF LEAKING SHADY
CONFIDENTIAL PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTS

408
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
Leaked documents…

409
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,520
That means there was someone else
who knew about Kritsana Real Estate.

410
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,000
On-Anong…

411
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,600
Actress…

412
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
Mistress…

413
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,840
Silenced…

414
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,360
DISAPPEARED FROM THE PUBLIC EYE AFTER…

415
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,240
This is it.
This is the next lead in our search.

416
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,400
I think everything's connected.

417
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,240
What about the rumor that
she was eliminated?

418
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,360
That's true.

419
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,400
If she had really died,
there'd be a record of it somewhere.

420
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,760
I looked all over, but nothing came up.

421
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,840
Maybe it's just gossip.

422
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,800
If she's alive,

423
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,920
how do we find her?

424
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,000
With all these rumors,

425
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,400
how do we find her?

426
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,920
<i>You're looking into Mom's case too, Marn?</i>

427
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,960
Prai-Fon,

428
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,120
you're digging into this too, right?

429
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,240
Storm and Sairung too.

430
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,680
All five of you,

431
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,400
if you'd stop fighting
and actually team up,

432
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,960
you girls would be like the Avengers.

433
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,960
- There'd be nothing you couldn't do.
- That's nonsense.

434
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,720
Especially when it comes to your mother.

435
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,200
Other girls are also digging into this.

436
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Storm, Prai-Fon, and Marnmok.

437
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,720
If you join forces,

438
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,800
you can crack this thing, you know.

439
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,880
All five of us must work together.

440
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,760
The five of us together
still count as one, Marn.

441
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,520
I don't think that's enough.

442
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
We've got Pat too.

443
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,400
We need three more.

444
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,560
I think this zone is good now.

445
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,080
- Can you check upstairs next?
- Sure.

446
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,040
Thank you.

447
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,400
Marnmok.

448
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,840
This is cool.

449
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,880
You've got your own photo exhibition.

450
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,280
Sky shots?

451
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,480
Not a single one of me?

452
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,600
No more small talk.

453
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,800
I need your help.

454
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm waiting.

455
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,360
I want you to hit on a woman.

456
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,400
Hey, no. Don't be joking.

457
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,600
I meant it. I'm not joking.

458
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,120
You're joking.

459
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,640
I'm a photographer now.

460
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,360
I'm pretty sure your flirting skills
haven't gone anywhere.

461
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,880
Marnmok.

462
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,160
I'm truly sorry

463
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,200
for everything I did to you.

464
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,240
Then make it up to me by helping me.

465
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,280
Prai-Fon.

466
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,040
Don't try to fix something

467
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,840
when it's not broken.

468
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,680
But if it's already broken,

469
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,760
you've got to fix it, Sun.

470
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
If you help,

471
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,440
I will…

472
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,400
talk to you.

473
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,800
De, my beloved little bro.

474
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,960
We've got a new job.

475
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,720
I really couldn't turn this one down.

476
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,120
It's going to be the highest pay
I've ever received.

477
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,720
Welcome, everyone, to my secret base.

478
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,320
It's just a co-working space.

479
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,280
It's hardly a secret base.

480
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,320
Come on, bro. You're killing the vibe.

481
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,440
Once in a while, I get to play detective
and dig up the truth.

482
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,000
- Go back to your seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

483
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,199
The objective, or purpose of this mission,
is to get close to our target.

484
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,719
Based on some of the evidence
my mom left behind,

485
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,159
and the data we've collected,

486
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,400
we've found that this woman…

487
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,040
might be our key lead.

488
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,159
Prai! Just get to the point already.

489
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,040
If you're going to keep going,
do you mind adding subtitles for me too?

490
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,800
And this woman's name is…

491
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,240
O-S? "OS"?

492
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,320
Our target's a foreigner?

493
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,520
It's Thai. "ON"!

494
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,480
Prai.

495
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,160
Why don't you let Marn take it from here?
It'd be easier for everyone to understand.

496
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,720
Okay, okay. You're not the only ones
who find me hard to follow.

497
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,680
The target I want you to hit on
is named On-Anong.

498
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,440
She's a former actress
rumored to have been Kritsana's mistress.

499
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,840
But we're still not sure
if she's alive or dead.

500
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,000
If she's still alive,

501
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,600
where is she?

502
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,080
I think this is something
De can help us with.

503
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,560
You got it, boss.

504
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,600
Once De gets some leads about On-Anong,

505
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,120
it's your job

506
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,240
to get close to her
and get the info we need from her.

507
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,360
Once we have everything,
we'll regroup and discuss our next move.

508
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
Marn,

509
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,680
check this out.

510
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,480
"Body of man found on riverbank."

511
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,480
"Rope marks found on neck."

512
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,520
"Victim was a veteran boxing coach
recently released from prison."

513
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,000
"Police suspect
it was a silencing murder."

514
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,440
Isn't he Storm's boxing coach?

515
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,080
Right after Storm got near Coach Chatch,

516
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,000
he was taken out.

517
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,680
Marn, you really need to be careful.

518
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,000
Let me know
every time you're going somewhere.

519
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,080
Bro, it's time for you to get to work.

520
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,440
That's On-Anong's location in real time.

521
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,360
How did you do that?

522
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,320
Phone number, credit cards, or bank info,
they're all for sale on the grey market.

523
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,960
I got it from an insurance telemarketer.

524
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,920
It's really not that hard.

525
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,040
You're really scary.

526
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Anyway, bro.

527
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,440
You need to check whether
the owner of the phone

528
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,600
and the person who's using it
are the same person.

529
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,760
Okay.

530
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,320
Where is that?

531
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,360
Hlung's bar.

532
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,080
You know that place?

533
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,080
Yes, it's my usual spot.

534
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,120
You also used to…

535
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,800
Sairung also used to go there. But…

536
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,000
why is the target so close?

537
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,160
How about we go there now?

538
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,640
No, you can't.

539
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,120
You wait here.

540
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,240
I'm going there with Sun.

541
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,400
- But I…
- You saw what happened to that coach.

542
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,600
Just wait for updates here.

543
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,440
Leave the risky task to me.

544
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,000
You hired me after all, right?

545
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,000
Just wait here.

546
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,640
I'm coming with you.

547
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,000
If you get stabbed again,
it will only slow things down.

548
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,000
Bro.

549
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,000
There she is. On-Anong.

550
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,800
I'm Sun.

551
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,600
Am I too young?

552
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,520
Am I too old
for us to get to know each other?

553
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,560
Slut!

554
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,400
What a slutty Sun!

555
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,000
Relax. He's just doing his job.

556
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,400
This place isn't fun anymore.

557
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,520
Let's go have fun somewhere else.

558
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,480
<i>Come on.</i>

559
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,600
She knows.

560
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,960
If she already knows, it might actually
make things easier for you.

561
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,360
What if it makes things
even more dangerous?

562
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,720
Even Coach Chatch got taken out.
Sun stands no chance.

563
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,640
Give me the location. I'm going there.
