1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,360
My mother really didn't take her own life.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,240
What about the news
saying it was an affair?

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,960
It was fake news.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:08,880
Fake news?

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,520
Shit. Who was behind it?

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,280
The one who wrote it was the reporter.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,000
But the one who twisted the story?

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,320
Who else do you think it could be?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,560
The person who released the story

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,920
about my mother having an affair
and overdosing…

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,960
Shit.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
…was my father?

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,640
"A newspaper journalist
took her own life by overdosing."

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,400
"Suspected cause:
Family issues related to alleged affair."

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,560
What does that have to do with you?

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,680
That alleged affair was with my father!

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,680
Was it this fucking hand that wrote
the fake news that ruined my life?

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,200
Pat!

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,280
Get a grip. Come on.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's make it right

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,120
the right way, Pat.

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
Pat drank himself to sleep.

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
I told De and Gudji to watch over him.

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Dad.

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,600
Don't let what everyone lost
be for nothing.

26
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,440
Mom was a victim.

27
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,680
Pat and I are also victims in this,

28
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,600
and so are you.

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,040
Even if we stay silent and safe,

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,000
we'll have to live with the doubt
for the rest of our lives, Dad.

31
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry, Marnmok.

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,160
I'm truly sorry for everything I did.

33
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,960
Let's make it right, Dad.

34
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,000
From now on,

35
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,400
whatever lies ahead,

36
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,280
we'll face it together.

37
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,040
But…

38
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,280
all the evidence we had was burned.

39
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,800
We'll have to find another way.

40
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,160
I've still got some of the evidence
from Mom's house.

41
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,480
But I couldn't find this tape.

42
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,520
Any chance On-Anong has a clue?

43
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
Most of the evidence was burned.

44
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,480
But not all of it.

45
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
I couldn't bring myself to burn this one.

46
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,560
ACTRESS UNDER SCRUTINY

47
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,720
<i>I still think about your mom.</i>

48
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
As for what happened that day…

49
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,720
Even if I could go back,

50
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I probably would've made the same choice.

51
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
<i>Back then,</i>

52
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,800
Pornnapa, Sairung,

53
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,440
and my career,

54
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,680
<i>not to mention Pat's parents…</i>

55
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,000
There was no easy choice.

56
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,360
But today,

57
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,000
I have to make a choice again.

58
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,560
This time, I know
I'm not facing it alone anymore

59
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,640
because you're an adult now.

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,320
Let's make this thing right together.

61
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,520
Thank you so much, Dad.

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,400
Sun, can you plug this cord in?

63
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,320
<i>How long have you been working</i>
<i>for Kritsana Real Estate?</i>

64
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,160
<i>I'm entering my seventh year this year.</i>

65
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,640
<i>What's your responsibility?</i>

66
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,800
<i>I work in project development.</i>

67
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,440
My main responsibility is land management.

68
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
Was this Pat's father?

69
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
Yes.

70
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,040
With this much evidence,
both documents and witnesses,

71
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,160
it might be enough
to spark a deeper investigation.

72
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,320
And then everyone will know

73
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,320
that the reporter named Pornnapa

74
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
wasn't a coward.

75
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,120
She did her job as a journalist
the best she could.

76
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,960
Honey,

77
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,560
I'm in this with you now.

78
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,320
<i>I know an investigative journalist.</i>

79
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,440
<i>I'll talk to him</i>
<i>and pass all this evidence along.</i>

80
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,159
<i>I'm sure it's going to</i>
<i>blow up into a big story.</i>

81
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,840
Please take care of it for me.

82
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,080
Yes, what's up?

83
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,440
<i>Check the news now, bro.</i>

84
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,200
<i>In addition to numerous leaked</i>
<i>confidential documents,</i>

85
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,480
<i>there is witness testimony as well.</i>

86
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,800
<i>This has prompted both the police</i>
<i>and forensic authorities</i>

87
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,240
<i>to reassess their practices</i>
<i>with increased scrutiny.</i>

88
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,600
<i>There are widespread rumors</i>
<i>linking Mr. Kritsana</i>

89
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,920
<i>to a past relationship</i>
<i>with a former top actress,</i>

90
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
<i>with allegations that he physically</i>
<i>assaulted her multiple times.</i>

91
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,120
<i>If these claims turn out to be true,</i>

92
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,720
<i>this could become a scandal</i>
<i>that shakes both the business world</i>

93
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,360
<i>and the entertainment industry.</i>

94
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,360
I hope it's not something
that comes and goes like the wind.

95
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,280
<i>Mr. Krisana has reported</i>
<i>to police for questioning.</i>

96
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,720
<i>Confidence has plunged as buyers</i>
<i>pull out of Kritsana Real Estate projects.</i>

97
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
<i>Kritsana Real Estate's stock</i>
<i>continues to drop steadily.</i>

98
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,880
<i>Foreign investors have immediately</i>
<i>suspended all joint ventures.</i>

99
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,560
Things are finally being made right, Dad.

100
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,880
How about feeding me
with those chopsticks?

101
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,440
You've got your own chopsticks.

102
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,920
Your hand works just fine.

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Why do I have to feed you?

104
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,000
How about feeding me
with those chopsticks?

105
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
Close your eyes then.

106
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,360
Look who's being sweet now.

107
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
Want another bite?

108
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,880
What the heck, boss?

109
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,280
You ruined my mood.

110
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,080
Hey there, young man.

111
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,680
Have you eaten? Would you like to join us?

112
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,160
I've eaten.

113
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,440
I'm here to tell you all

114
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,120
that I'm going to quit.

115
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
My time here is done.

116
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,120
Things are falling into place
where they should be.

117
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,520
There's nothing more I can do here.

118
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,200
Please accept my apology, boss,

119
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,720
for everything that happened.

120
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,520
I owe you an apology too for what I did.

121
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,680
I didn't mean it.

122
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,400
I was lame.

123
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,640
Everyone was, boss.

124
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm sorry, Marn.

125
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,840
What for?

126
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,040
For… not being sincere
with you all this time.

127
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,120
Please forgive me.

128
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,000
Actually, you don't really have to quit.

129
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,240
Dad still needs a good reporter
on his side.

130
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,680
I still can't face everyone,

131
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,800
at least not for a while.

132
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
But if things settle down,

133
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
I'll come back to work with you, Marn.

134
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,320
And you too, boss.

135
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,480
May I offer you a warning?

136
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,800
I don't know when Kritsana will find out
who got hold of the evidence.

137
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,920
Please be careful.

138
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
I'll see myself out.

139
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Hey.

140
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
We haven't really talked yet.

141
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
I've got to hand it to you.

142
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
Hand what to me?

143
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,520
I'm letting you have this one.

144
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,600
If it's what's best for Sairung,
Marnmok, and the others.

145
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,800
It's probably what I want too.

146
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,080
Do you always have to sound so cool?

147
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,840
Really? If that sounds cool,
then I guess it's just my natural self.

148
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,560
If you were a girl, I'd probably
be flirting with you right now.

149
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,840
What kind of vibe is that?

150
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,680
See you around.

151
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
See you.

152
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
This is yours.

153
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,000
Just throw it. Throw it away.

154
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,920
Fahsai.

155
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,360
Fahsai.

156
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Fahsai.

157
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,400
Sairung.

158
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,120
Is Sairung there?

159
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,400
Sis, what are you doing?

160
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,600
I'm checking
if Sairung is doing all right now.

161
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,760
Things with her mother
are all sorted, right?

162
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,080
Yeah, you're right.

163
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,360
- I'll help too.
- Okay.

164
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,600
Prai-Fon, yoohoo!

165
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,960
Are you there?

166
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Prai-Fon.

167
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,640
What's with you two? What are you doing?

168
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,680
We're checking in
to see how Sairung is managing her DID.

169
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,360
Storm.

170
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,440
Storm.

171
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,200
Bro, I think she's doing better now.

172
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,800
Only Marnmok is left.

173
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,920
She's doing okay now, I bet.

174
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
We did it. Yeah!

175
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,200
Okay my butt!

176
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,920
You're being ridiculous!

177
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm not hung up on my mom anymore.

178
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,760
But I, Fahsai, am in here
with everyone just the same.

179
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,600
I'm not going anywhere.

180
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,600
We've got both Storm and Fahsai.

181
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,920
And things are turning out
the way Mom wanted.

182
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm okay to be like this.

183
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,080
Don't worry about me.

184
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,680
Prai-Fon's here too.

185
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,720
Full party.

186
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,200
Or could it get worse?

187
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,520
There's still my theory.

188
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,400
"Where there's love, there's life."
Mahatma Gandhi.

189
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,520
The power of love. It has the ability
to make you do anything.

190
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,240
Oi!

191
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,880
Okay.

192
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,320
So how do you feel now?

193
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,160
Feel?

194
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,200
What do you mean?

195
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,520
How do you feel about Sun?

196
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,839
Dad!

197
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,839
I told you, right?

198
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,160
No matter what method
it takes to help you heal,

199
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,680
I'm ready to try it.

200
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,000
LIGHT AND SHADOW GALLERY

201
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,200
Why did you bring me here this late?

202
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,400
Your exhibition's not even
open to the public yet.

203
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,000
Think of this as a soft opening.

204
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,040
Come on.

205
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,680
I've got something for you to see.

206
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,960
Wait.

207
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,920
Close your eyes first.

208
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,520
What now?

209
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
Come on.

210
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,960
Now open your eyes.

211
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,560
Just like your dad asked…

212
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,480
How do you feel about me?

213
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,040
Not just Marnmok.

214
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,320
I also want to hear from Sairung,

215
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,240
Storm,

216
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,560
Prai-Fon,

217
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,920
and Fahsai.

218
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,800
This time, I want the answer…

219
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,200
not for work,

220
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,440
not for your dad,

221
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,480
but for myself.

222
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,640
All five of you…

223
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,800
how do you feel about me?

224
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,960
The other four already answered you.

225
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
What about you, Marnmok?

226
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,640
How do you feel about me?

227
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Marnmok?

228
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,280
Marnmok will…

229
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,080
open her heart and give you a chance.

230
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,800
But I want to ask you something too.

231
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,200
If I manage to heal from the trauma,

232
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,000
that might mean
I end up living as a single identity.

233
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,640
Please do not ask me.

234
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,520
I can't choose.

235
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,560
That's not an option, Sun.

236
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
You have to answer.

237
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,920
Who will you choose to carry
the final version of us?

238
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,200
It's time.

239
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
You have to choose…

240
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,400
the one you love the most.

241
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
<i>If I manage to heal from the trauma,</i>

242
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,960
that might mean
I end up living as a single identity.

243
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,000
Please.

244
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,400
Please do not ask me.

245
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,320
I can't choose.

246
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,160
That's not an option, Sun.

247
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,800
Who will you choose to carry
the final version of us?

248
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,680
It's time.

249
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,440
You have to choose…

250
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,960
the one you love the most.

251
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,840
With you,

252
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,280
I feel warm inside.

253
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,800
<i>You coming into my life</i>
<i>has brought so much more color to it.</i>

254
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,240
Let's fly out of the book together.

255
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,720
Let's fight this together.

256
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Sairung.

257
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,240
How are you doing?

258
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,640
Marnmok will open her heart
and give you a chance.

259
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,560
Whoa, Sun.

260
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,120
You really know how to create
touching moments.

261
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,480
I didn't do it for that.

262
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,280
I really wanted to do this for them.

263
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,120
I called you guys here
because I need your advice.

264
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,600
I honestly don't know what to do.

265
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,120
It's a really hard question to answer.

266
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,760
Maybe I don't have to. I can just
keep living with them like this.

267
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,960
Why would you do that?

268
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,960
Are you out of your mind?

269
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,920
Wasn't the whole point
to help her get better?

270
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
If it were me,

271
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,320
I would choose Fahsai.

272
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,120
She's fun, cute, full of life,
and drama-free.

273
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,280
Being with her makes me feel at ease.

274
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,960
But Prai-Fon's pretty interesting too.

275
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,440
She's super positive.

276
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,880
Being with her makes me feel at ease too.

277
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
Just gotta be ready to listen a bit.

278
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,240
She talks a lot.

279
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,360
Why wouldn't you choose Sairung
or the other three?

280
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,440
With Sairung?

281
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,240
I wouldn't be able to keep up.
She'd have me spinning with her games.

282
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,680
But I think Sairung is kinda intriguing.

283
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,840
She's hot.
There's something exciting about her.

284
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,480
How about Storm?
She's like the national's dream hubby.

285
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,480
Being with her would feel
super warm and cozy.

286
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,680
So Marnmok's not even in the running?

287
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,120
I'd pick Marnmok!

288
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,040
Hey, boss. Come on in. We're
in the middle of an intense discussion.

289
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,120
What's all this about?

290
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,600
This is a big matter.
We need to brainstorm.

291
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,000
He was free, so I invited him.

292
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,760
Sis, are you out of your mind?

293
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,280
How could you ask him to choose
when it's his own daughter?

294
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,440
I'd pick Marnmok.

295
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,080
She might give off a strict impression,

296
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,080
but when she opens up to someone,

297
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,760
she's really sweet.

298
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,080
I agree.

299
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,360
Do you know Marnmok that well?

300
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,320
I do.

301
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,720
Is this your sixth personality?

302
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,960
Lightning or Thunderbolt?

303
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,320
No. I'm Sairung.

304
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,520
What's that?
You don't seem like Sairung.

305
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,120
Is everything all right?

306
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,520
You seem a bit strange.

307
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,640
No, I'm okay.

308
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,040
Marnmok has her chill side too.

309
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,400
But she gets scared easily.

310
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,000
You knew that was Marnmok all along?

311
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,200
But I played along

312
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,000
so I could get to know her better.

313
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,400
Choosing a woman
really depends on age and timing.

314
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,800
If I were still a teenager,

315
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,880
definitely Prai-Fon.

316
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,680
It's got that vibe,

317
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,720
like a junior crushing on a senior.
You know what I mean?

318
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,120
She's got it all, maturity and wisdom.

319
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,360
Checks every box!

320
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,760
Or Marnmok.

321
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,640
With her, not only do you get a senior,

322
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,560
you get a new mom too.

323
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,560
Hi, Mom.

324
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,560
But if I were a bit older,

325
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,560
say, 30,

326
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,240
I'd go straight there.

327
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Sairung.

328
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,800
She's pretty, outgoing,
and a lot of fun to be around.

329
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,120
Or Storm.

330
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,800
You have another tough guy
to keep you company.

331
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,600
But if you're more grown-up,
really serious and mature,

332
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,560
then Fahsai is your answer.

333
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,440
Fahsai brings
all the brightness and energy

334
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,200
that adults need.

335
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,840
He's picking from his own daughters.

336
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,400
He's super weird.

337
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,720
It just feels wrong on every level.

338
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,640
Fie, De!

339
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,560
Sunday, sir.

340
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,680
That's your name, you dork.

341
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,800
Fie, De!

342
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,000
I thought he was saying "Friday."

343
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,000
I heard everything you said
behind my back.

344
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,320
But never mind.

345
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,480
Let's get to the point.

346
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,520
You have to choose.

347
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,760
When you're with them,
which one makes you the happiest?

348
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,560
Or who makes you happier than the others?

349
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,080
Or…

350
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,200
which one of her
makes both of you happiest?

351
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,360
Thanks so much for helping, everyone.

352
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,960
I really hope this will help
Sairung get better.

353
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,200
I've been waiting for this day
for so long.

354
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,480
If she really does get better,

355
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,920
your theory is going to shake
the entire medical world.

356
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,040
That's true.

357
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Just like the movie <i>Lorenzo's Oil.</i>

358
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
"Are you a scientist?"

359
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,400
"No, I'm just a father."

360
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,800
Call me <i>Theppachai's Oil.</i>

361
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,400
- What's he rambling about?
- Who's that?

362
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,120
That movie came out before I was born.

363
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,000
Sis.

364
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,960
Seriously? A couple has to eat
or drink the same thing?

365
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,080
What are you talking about?
Who's a couple?

366
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,200
By the way, De. That place you asked me
to reserve, I already took care of it.

367
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,400
Sun!

368
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,400
You're about to have your own sweetheart.

369
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,800
Here. For you.

370
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,320
Hey! What secret are you two hiding?

371
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,160
Hey, guys.

372
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,400
Kritsana Real Estate just launched
a brand new mega project.

373
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,160
<i>After major reports exposed</i>
<i>forced evictions through arson</i>

374
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,480
<i>and bid-rigging in several</i>
<i>Kritsana Real Estate projects,</i>

375
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,760
<i>no one has come forward</i>
<i>to answer questions.</i>

376
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,680
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Kritsana Real Estate has announced</i>

377
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,280
<i>a new development megaproject</i>
<i>worth a massive billion baht instead.</i>

378
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,920
<i>Mr. Kritsana, may we get an interview?</i>

379
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,680
<i>- Just a quick interview, please!</i>
<i>- Of course.</i>

380
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,800
<i>Will this mega project push your company</i>
<i>into the country's top three?</i>

381
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,840
<i>I don't really see it as a "mega project."</i>

382
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,560
<i>It's just another important step forward</i>
<i>for my company. That's all.</i>

383
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,680
<i>There are reports claiming</i>
<i>a certain minister supported this project,</i>

384
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,000
<i>which made approval much easier.</i>
<i>Is that true?</i>

385
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,440
<i>Doing business</i>
<i>without connections or support,</i>

386
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,720
<i>is that even possible?</i>

387
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,040
<i>Wouldn't you agree?</i>

388
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,640
<i>I just received a little help, that's all.</i>

389
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,360
<i>But the scandals from the past</i>

390
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,920
<i>haven't been officially addressed.</i>

391
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,640
<i>Our legal team is already working on that.</i>

392
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,680
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

393
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,320
<i>All the documents are verifiable.</i>

394
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,760
<i>Let the matter be settled in court.</i>

395
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,160
<i>It won't affect the company in any way.</i>

396
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,040
<i>But there's both documented</i>
<i>and oral evidence.</i>

397
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,480
LAUNCHING MAJOR PROJECT
AMID SCANDAL BACKLASH

398
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,160
<i>Just a few documents</i>

399
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,640
<i>and a handful of people</i>
<i>trying to discredit my company.</i>

400
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,200
<i>I don't see that as a major problem.</i>

401
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,160
<i>If I can take Kritsana Real Estate forward</i>
<i>to the Asian and global stage,</i>

402
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,040
<i>isn't that something</i>
<i>we should all be proud of as a country?</i>

403
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,520
<i>So I'd appreciate your support</i>
<i>on this matter.</i>

404
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,960
<i>The launch of</i>
<i>Kritsana Real Estate's new project</i>

405
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,920
<i>has turned the company's stock around,</i>
<i>sending it back into positive territory</i>

406
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,680
<i>with prices soaring even higher</i>
<i>than before.</i>

407
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,240
"Just a few documents
and a handful of people…"

408
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,440
Damn. We're no match for him.

409
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,320
He could basically take over
the whole country.

410
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,960
That's terrifying.

411
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,960
Listen.

412
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,800
Follow me.

413
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,200
I want you all to see something.

414
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,280
What is it, Dad?

415
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,680
It was just installed yesterday.

416
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,440
The project that was just announced.

417
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,160
A man like Kritsana,

418
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,200
he's made it this far.

419
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,600
This little scandal
won't even scratch him.

420
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,720
Money isn't God.

421
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,080
Money is power.

422
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,880
The kind of power
that makes everything go his way.

423
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,600
It commands the poor, the powerful,

424
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,360
the police, the military,

425
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,720
and even the courts.

426
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,240
It can turn wrong into right.

427
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,400
It can even decide who lives or dies.

428
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,719
But we can still cause a ripple.

429
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,080
A powerful wave starts with a ripple.

430
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,000
If there's no ripple at all,

431
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,960
there'll never be a wave strong enough
to crash Kritsana Real Estate down.

432
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,120
At the very least,

433
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,000
what we did
has become a digital footprint.

434
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,080
And people will know

435
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,000
that a journalist named Pornnapa
wasn't a coward who committed suicide.

436
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,480
<i>You have to answer.</i>

437
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,400
Who will you choose to carry
the final version of us?

438
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,920
<i>Ms. Marnmok.</i>

439
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,960
Yes, Sun?

440
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,680
Can we see each other?

441
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
Sure, I have no plans.

442
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,720
And the others too.

443
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,920
I mean…

444
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,040
Sairung,

445
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,160
Prai-Fon,

446
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,280
Storm,

447
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,560
and Fahsai too.

448
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,680
Ah, sure.

449
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,600
<i>What's up, Sun?</i>

450
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,720
You've got me excited.

451
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,360
Treating you to something sweet.

452
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,560
Interested?

453
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,920
Please be mindful of our HbA1C levels.

454
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,520
They're almost as high as Everest.

455
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,520
What's that?

456
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,040
Sugar in the blood. Duh.

457
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,800
Prai, you're exaggerating again.

458
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,560
Have you seen how much sugar you eat?

459
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,920
Not that much. Come on.

460
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,120
Cut it out.

461
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,000
Here comes the storm.

462
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,480
Well, where should we meet, Sun?

463
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,360
I'll send you the location, dear.

464
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,200
You made such a big deal
when asking us out.

465
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,800
Isn't this just a café?

466
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,240
Fahsai started it.
She was the first to get all excited.

467
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,120
Want something to drink first?

468
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,080
Nah.

469
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,840
But seeing how you're acting here
does get me a little excited.

470
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,640
I'm going to give you the answer.

471
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,040
I'm listening.

472
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,480
Got your pick?

473
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,360
To get better from this condition…

474
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,280
there has to be
only one of us left, right?

475
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,480
That's true.

476
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,600
I'd like to apologize again.

477
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,080
What brought us together isn't exactly
something worth remembering.

478
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,960
Still, it's something
that can't be unremembered.

479
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,320
All five of you taught me
what sincerity really means.
