1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,640
<i>Just a few documents</i>

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,680
<i>and a handful of people</i>
<i>trying to discredit my company.</i>

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,160
<i>I don't see that</i>
<i>as a major problem.</i>

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,240
At the very least, what we did

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,760
has become a digital footprint.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,200
Marnmok will open her heart
and give you a chance.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>It's time.</i>

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
You have to choose…

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,400
the one you love the most.

10
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,720
Sis, careful. Walk slowly.

11
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,560
- This way.
- You fool, De.

12
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,000
Are you luring me into the woods
to kill me or something?

13
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,440
Seriously, stop it.
You're making me nervous.

14
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,240
Why would I hide you in the woods?

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,840
The trees there wouldn't welcome you.
They want peace and quiet.

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
De!

17
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,520
Keep walking and stop complaining.

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,080
Stay right here.

19
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,840
What the heck are you doing, De?

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,840
You do know this is the place

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,120
that made me cry for three days
and three nights, right?

22
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,240
Take it easy, sis.

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,720
If you don't take us seriously,
that's fine.

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,440
Just leave me alone.

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,440
Wait. Hear me out first.

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Calm down. Don't get mad at me yet.

27
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,160
I wanted you to start over.

28
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,760
What?

29
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,640
So I brought you back to
the day that hurt you.

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,000
So that from now on, you'll remember…

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
there's someone else who…

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,480
Come on, speak faster.

33
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,200
Sis Gudji, can I make a move on you?

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,560
I'm saying this because
I'm serious about you.

35
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,720
You don't have to answer right now.

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Take all the time you need

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,920
till you're sure that I could be the guy
who can truly help you move on.

38
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,640
I didn't catch all of that. Say it again.

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
Sis Gudji, can I make a move on you?

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm saying this because
I'm serious about you.

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,080
You don't have to answer right now.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,120
Take all the time you need

43
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
till you're sure that I could be the guy
who can truly help you move on.

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,960
Will I get to understand anything today?

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,680
But you told me to speak faster.

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,960
Are you messing with me?

47
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,680
Say it again.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,160
Sis Gudji, can I make a move on you?

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,160
I'm saying this

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,120
because I've thought it through,
and I'm serious about you.

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,640
You don't have to answer right now.

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,400
Take all the time you need

53
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,360
until you're sure that I could be the guy
who can truly help you move on.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,280
This is going to be an important piece
of evidence you just gave me.

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,560
If you are not really serious about us,

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,760
this is what I'll use
to hold you accountable.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Wow, you're good at blackmail.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,400
Stop it. You talk too much. I'm hungry.

59
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,600
All right, all right.

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,560
Please, ma'am.

61
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,400
What?

62
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,800
Hey, hey! What do you think you're doing?

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,160
Don't be such a perv.

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,839
I'm about to make this moment
even more special than you imagined.

65
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,800
Lee Min-ho, Park Bo-gum,
Cha Eun-woo, Jaehyun…

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,240
Do any of them like you as much as I do?

67
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,240
De, you fool. This is way too much.

68
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,640
Do you like it though?

69
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,200
You did really well.

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,920
Go sit down.

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,720
From now on,
I'm not calling you "Gudji" anymore.

72
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,840
What will you call me?

73
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,520
Gudji, my darling.

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
Ugh. You're making me puke.

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,920
All right then, I'm not calling you
De anymore either.

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,680
What will you call me?

77
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,280
My De.

78
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,480
Stop it. Quit playing around.
I want to eat now.

79
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,800
I'd like to apologize again.

80
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,240
What brought us together isn't exactly
something worth remembering.

81
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,480
Still, it's something
that can't be unremembered.

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,000
Throughout this time,

83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,360
I've learned so much.

84
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
More importantly,

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,160
I've come to know myself

86
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,160
and understand my own feelings better.

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,160
And I've also learned

88
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,120
what it is we both really want
in this relationship.

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
What is it?

90
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,960
Sincerity.

91
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,920
And to give back too.

92
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,600
All five of you taught me
what sincerity really means.

93
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,480
I…

94
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,400
love all five of you.

95
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,000
All this time, each of you taking turns
to step into the light…

96
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,360
it was really something
out of the ordinary, you know.

97
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,680
But it was also a lot of fun.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,880
So when you asked me to choose…

99
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,360
I couldn't.

100
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,000
And I'm not going to choose either.

101
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,000
Because choosing one would mean
making the other four disappear.

102
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,920
I could never do that.

103
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,480
If it's not you,
then who's supposed to choose?

104
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
All of you.

105
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,960
You all have to decide

106
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,800
which one of you
will carry the final version.

107
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,800
How are we supposed to do that, Sun?

108
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,600
Which one of you

109
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,000
can make us

110
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,880
and the other four the happiest?

111
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,680
Have you ever thought about this?

112
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,480
That from the very first night
we met at the bar,

113
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
it's brought so much chaos to our lives
all the way through to today.

114
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,520
No, I haven't.
I haven't thought about that at all.

115
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
But you know something, Sairung?

116
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,520
Out of all five of you,

117
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,760
you weren't the first one I met.

118
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,000
Really?

119
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,720
How come you never told me that?

120
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,880
I met Marnmok first.

121
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,280
Love at first sight?

122
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
I think…

123
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,600
it's possible.

124
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,600
You okay?

125
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm okay.

126
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Hey, Sun.

127
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,440
If we've made our decision,

128
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,240
then what will happen next?

129
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,560
Yes, what do we do?

130
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,960
How about this?

131
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,800
The final version of us

132
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,160
will come see you.

133
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,280
So we have to choose then?

134
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,560
We have to choose.

135
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,240
To get better from this condition…

136
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,280
there has to be
only one of us left, right?

137
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,320
It's what we've always wanted

138
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,360
so we could live a normal life,
just like other people do.

139
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
That's true.

140
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,920
Who then?

141
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,120
Sun!

142
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,240
He's so mean.

143
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,320
How could he make us be
the ones to choose?

144
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,320
Theoretically, it's the right choice.

145
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,600
Love should be between two people.

146
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,920
I understand.

147
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,800
But how do we choose?

148
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,520
Honestly,

149
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm starting to get used
to living like this.

150
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,040
When things get tough, it's hard, yeah.

151
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,000
But every day, we take turns
stepping into the light.

152
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
We get to do things and be different.

153
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,800
That's truly a benefit
of the life we have.

154
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,120
I used to think

155
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,800
that if I were someone else
looking back at Sairung,

156
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,520
I'd probably be jealous of how fun she is.

157
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,480
On the days we need to go through
a tough fight,

158
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,680
we've got Storm, our tough girl.

159
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,360
On the days we need to go against
our targets or tough opponents,

160
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,720
you're an amazing coach to us,
you know that?

161
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,160
And you, Sairung.

162
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,080
You lead us to explore the world
in a new light.

163
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
Like there's nothing that can scare you.

164
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,480
Even if I sometimes lead you all
into risky situations.

165
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,120
It's because I've got you, Marnmok.

166
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,000
You're our self-defense mechanism.

167
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,680
The one who helps keep us safe.

168
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,000
I love you, Marnmok.

169
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,720
I love you too, Sairung.

170
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,000
Hold up!

171
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,160
You all are each other's something.
What about me? Am I the useless one?

172
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,200
You're something too.

173
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,000
What am I to you?

174
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,080
You're our source of diabetes!

175
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
You keep adding sugar, you know.

176
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,600
Hey, be serious, Prai-Fon. Come on.

177
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,440
We can't be without you, Fahsai.

178
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,920
Because you're our sunshine.

179
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,440
<i>All five of us may not seem normal,</i>

180
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,320
<i>but in truth,</i>

181
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,880
<i>every human has multiple emotions</i>
<i>and sides to their personality.</i>

182
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,600
<i>It's just that</i>

183
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,200
<i>those sides aren't</i>
<i>clearly divided like ours.</i>

184
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,120
That means that
even if we return to being one,

185
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,480
the other four will still remain

186
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,400
in this body, in the same shared space,

187
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,680
and we'll love ourselves the same.

188
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,480
I love you all.

189
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,600
I love every one of you.

190
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,800
I love the way you are as Prai-Fon,

191
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,560
the way you are as Storm,

192
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,640
the way you are as Fahsai,

193
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,840
and the way you are as Sairung.

194
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,280
I'm truly glad to have known you all.

195
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,920
So… it's time to choose now, right?

196
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,240
INCLEMENT WEATHER DAY:
A DAY OF UNPREDICTABLE WEATHER

197
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,560
<i>The camera signal's working.</i>
<i>It's crystal clear.</i>

198
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
Why are you all so nosy?

199
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,319
Come on, bro.
Like we could just sit back and wait.

200
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,160
Yeah, I'm so excited
I can't even hold it in.

201
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,079
Oi, I need to pee.

202
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,800
Why are you here too, boss?

203
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,680
Didn't you see what your own daughter
was wearing when she left?

204
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
I didn't wake up in time
to catch that this morning.

205
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,200
Besides, it's way more fun
to see it right now.

206
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,560
Right? This is more exciting.

207
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,600
You called me over.

208
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,400
I thought something serious had happened.

209
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,120
- Aren't you curious though?
- I am.

210
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
Knew it. Come here.

211
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,800
You came back just for that?

212
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,280
I came just to see Sairung's happiness.

213
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,720
I didn't come here for you.

214
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,320
There you go, being cool again.

215
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,880
<i>It's time. Is she there yet?</i>

216
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,200
<i>Is she there?</i>

217
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,440
There she is.

218
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,400
Yeah!

219
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,520
So the final version is you?

220
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,000
Marnmok.

221
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,800
Told you not to mess with the system.

222
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,240
I'm her bestie, okay? Do you know
how many years I've known her?

223
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Don't test this dark force.

224
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,480
Look who just lost the bet.

225
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,880
Gambling is strictly prohibited
in this office.

226
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,800
This bet is void.

227
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,560
You lost. Accept it.

228
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,040
You've got grey hair. Take the loss.

229
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,560
What kind of father doesn't even know
his own daughter?

230
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,120
Money smells so good.

231
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,360
You look disappointed.

232
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,200
Not at all, I'm actually happy.

233
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,800
I came to say thank you.

234
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,200
Thank you for having fought through this
together with me.

235
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Today, I can finally overcome it.

236
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
And…

237
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,800
Thank you for being sincere.

238
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,200
But…

239
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,120
The final version

240
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,520
isn't me.

241
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,600
Plot…

242
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,560
twist!

243
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,760
That means the money's still in play.
I still have hope.

244
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,000
If it's not Marnmok,
that means Gudji's out!

245
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,080
I still have a chance.

246
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,560
Everyone

247
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,200
chose me.

248
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,320
Sairung?

249
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,080
Told you not to mess with the system.

250
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,200
What kind of father doesn't even know
his own daughter?

251
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,640
Oh, and you didn't even get to
cheer for your pick.

252
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,120
Get me a drink, I'll give you 1,000.

253
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,360
Go get it.

254
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,240
You look stunned.

255
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,880
Why would I be?

256
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,200
They're all you.

257
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,000
By the way,

258
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,320
why here, of all places?

259
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,160
There's something I want you to see.

260
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,160
I used to come here.

261
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,120
I feel like this place brings me
closer to the sky.

262
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,160
I finally get to give this back to you.

263
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,360
I hope you remember it.

264
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
I meant to leave it with you.

265
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,200
Destiny…

266
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,880
Sometimes it's shaped by people.

267
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,760
So…

268
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,320
I want you to keep it.

269
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,800
There!

270
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,440
It's happening now.

271
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,680
I used to see it here.

272
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,920
Offer light and kindness

273
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,920
to someone going through a hard time.

274
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,720
<i>Hey, hey, guess what day it is today?</i>

275
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
<i>What day?</i>

276
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,480
<i>I asked you what day it is today.</i>

277
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,400
<i>Saturday. How do you not know that?</i>

278
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,160
<i>Wrong.</i>

279
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,200
<i>Answer. Today is the first day</i>
<i>we're officially together.</i>

280
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,560
<i>Hey, why so quiet? Are you sad?</i>

281
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,200
HAVE YOU GONE TO BED?

282
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,680
NOT YET, WATCHING A MOVIE.
WHAT'S UP?

283
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,040
- GIVE ME A BREAK. CRAZY IN LOVE?
- I REALLY MISS YOU.

284
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,280
- WE JUST MET. SO CLINGY.
- I ALREADY MISS YOU.

285
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,200
- PLANS TOMORROW?
- WORK, DUH!

286
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,520
SEE YOU IN THE EVENING.
LET'S GO EAT.

287
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,920
1 YEAR LATER

288
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,720
<i>Hey, hey, guess what day it is today?</i>

289
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,840
<i>This again… it's Wednesday!</i>

290
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,480
<i>Wrong! It's our 1-year anniversary,</i>
<i>my girlfriend.</i>

291
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,240
<i>I knew that.</i>

292
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,320
<i>So where are you taking me to celebrate</i>
<i>our anniversary, my boyfriend?</i>

293
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,920
<i>What about you?</i>

294
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,320
<i>Got anywhere in mind</i>
<i>you wanna go for the anniversary?</i>

295
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,480
<i>Nah, no idea.</i>

296
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,720
<i>Me again!</i>

297
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,440
<i>I whispered that to myself.</i>
<i>How'd you hear it?</i>

298
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,480
ME AGAIN!!

299
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,480
<i>You typed it out!!!!</i>

300
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,760
<i>You wanted me to see it. Come on.</i>

301
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,200
<i>So where are we going?</i>
<i>Say it!</i>

302
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
<i>Nope. You'll find out soon.</i>

303
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,120
<i>Hmph!</i>

304
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,680
<i>But De ruined the vibe.</i>
<i>He wants to interview us.</i>

305
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,240
<i>Yes, what's that about? I'm confused.</i>

306
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,080
<i>No clue either.</i>

307
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,000
What are you doing, sis?
You're gonna erase the footage.

308
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,040
It's too dark! Can't you see that?

309
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,240
Come on, I adjusted the brightness
to be easier on my eyes.

310
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,360
Oi!

311
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,400
What's going on here?

312
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,520
You called us in for an interview,
but you can't even work the camera?

313
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,520
What's up with you, Decha?

314
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,280
It's her, bro.

315
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,800
What are you two even doing?

316
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,360
Well,

317
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,440
after Sun quit his heartbreaking service,

318
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,360
this man here lost his job too.

319
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,920
If I don't find him a decent job to do,
he'll definitely grow up to be a scammer.

320
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,120
"Grow up"? I'm not your kid, sis.

321
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,200
So I came up with the idea of writing
a new column for <i>Truth Today.</i>

322
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,240
It's going to be about love.
Sweet, fluttery, hopelessly smitten.

323
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,880
And we'll kick it off
with your love story.

324
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
And we're calling it…

325
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,560
"I Love All Five of Her!"

326
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,160
"Her, her, her…"

327
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,640
Wait, bro!

328
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,400
Where are you going? Sit back down.

329
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,360
What is this?
What kind of nonsense are you pulling?

330
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,400
Today's our anniversary.
We're going on a date.

331
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,320
Exactly why it's the perfect day for this.

332
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,520
It has to be today.

333
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Are you out of your mind?

334
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,480
And what's with that cheesy title?
This isn't some K-drama.

335
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,320
Don't you want to know
what Sairung really thinks about you?

336
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,240
All this time,

337
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,240
we've heard how you feel about
loving a woman with five personalities.

338
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,200
But we haven't heard from all five of them
about how they feel about all of this.

339
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,920
We've really thought this through.
This isn't just some silly joke.

340
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,160
Three, two, one.

341
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,360
So today, a year later,

342
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,360
how do I feel?

343
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,480
First of all,

344
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm glad I met you.

345
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Also…

346
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,400
Sis! Didn't you say you knew
how to work this thing?

347
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,160
What now? I already hit the record button.

348
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,920
No, the button you hit
turned the power off.

349
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,640
Oh.

350
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,120
What do we do now?

351
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Start over!

352
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,720
You do it.

353
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,000
Haven't we been here
too many times already? This bar.

354
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,680
Different occasions, different vibes.

355
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,240
Even the same place
can feel totally different.

356
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,280
I get the "occasions" part.

357
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,480
I just don't see how the vibe
could really change.

358
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,120
Well…

359
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,600
I reserved the whole place.

360
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,960
It's just us tonight.

361
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,280
You're incredible.

362
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,640
Oi.

363
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,560
It's spilling.

364
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,200
Here's to our anniversary.

365
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,880
Happy anniversary.

366
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,640
You closed the whole bar tonight?

367
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,560
You really went all out for this.

368
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,320
I have a confession.

369
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,320
The bar was already closed
for AC repairs in the kitchen.

370
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,200
What?

371
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,800
That's so not romantic.

372
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,640
Isn't it good there's just the two of us?

373
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,560
Right?

374
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,840
Let's eat.

375
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,800
<i>How is it after a year?</i>

376
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
I'm really glad I met you,

377
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,680
Mr. Sun.

378
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,040
Thank you.

379
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,600
Thank you too.

380
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,160
Thank you.

381
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,360
Don't do it unless you're told.

382
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,560
- What did you just say?
- Nothing important.

383
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,880
- What was that?
- Nothing.

384
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
What the hell?

385
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,360
Everything that happened…

386
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,840
I never wanted to go through it.

387
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,160
It wasn't easy for me, or anyone else,
to go through it.

388
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,880
But I'm grateful

389
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,000
to everyone for trying to help.

390
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,280
For doing their best
to find a way to help me overcome it.

391
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,640
My girlfriend,

392
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,280
time to stop staring at your phone.

393
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,640
<i>If I'd never seen your smile</i>

394
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,720
<i>If you and I had never locked eyes</i>

395
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,600
<i>When you were unaware</i>
<i>When you were shy</i>

396
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,600
<i>Had I not been right there</i>

397
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,800
Come up here and sing with me.

398
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,800
<i>I've tried to resist, to resist</i>

399
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,040
<i>But it's not easy, not a bit, not a bit</i>

400
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,800
<i>I wanna be just a friend</i>

401
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,520
<i>Nothing more than that</i>

402
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,320
<i>But my heart won't listen</i>

403
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,320
<i>Too close not to have my thoughts wander</i>

404
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,320
<i>Too close for me to handle</i>

405
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,080
<i>Someone next to you trembles</i>

406
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,920
<i>Have you realized this at all?</i>

407
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,480
<i>The more I get closer…</i>

408
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,280
<i>But I was able to overcome it,</i>

409
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,560
not just because of Sun's love,

410
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,720
but because of the love from all of you.

411
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Sun,

412
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,920
De,

413
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,680
Gudji,

414
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
Pat,

415
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,120
Mom,

416
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,640
and Dad.

417
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
That kind of love really can heal.

418
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,680
But the main source of love
is from Sun, right, Rung?

419
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
She didn't ask you.

420
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,800
<i>Don't be mad if I catch feelings for you</i>

421
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,880
<i>To be honest,</i>

422
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,520
<i>all this time,</i>

423
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,600
<i>I've never really felt like</i>
<i>I was just Sairung.</i>

424
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,320
<i>Sometimes, I'm full of energy,</i>
<i>overly alert,</i>

425
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,320
<i>and act a little childish like Fahsai.</i>

426
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,719
<i>Sometimes, I'm impulsive,</i>
<i>easily worked up,</i>

427
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,320
<i>and I feel like exerting myself,</i>
<i>like Storm does.</i>

428
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,679
<i>Sometimes, I feel low,</i>

429
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,360
<i>don't want to talk,</i>

430
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,159
<i>get irritated easily,</i>
<i>and feel like nothing's right,</i>

431
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,719
<i>just like Marnmok.</i>

432
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,760
<i>And then, Prai-Fon.</i>

433
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,280
<i>There are many times that I</i>

434
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,720
<i>get nerdy, curious,</i>
<i>and don't overthink things.</i>

435
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,960
<i>And I turn into Sairung</i>

436
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,000
<i>when I'm in the mood to do what I want,</i>
<i>just the way Sairung does.</i>

437
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,840
<i>Everyone has come together inside me.</i>

438
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,080
<i>If one day I can't hold it in</i>

439
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,400
<i>Don't be mad if I catch feelings for you</i>

440
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,040
It's like Sun has come
to help organize each part of me,

441
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,920
putting everyone in the right place.

442
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,280
No one disappears.

443
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,400
They're all still inside me.

444
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,520
Like the colors in a Rubik's Cube.

445
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,240
Yes.

446
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,200
It's already been a year. Time flies, huh?

447
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,160
I kinda miss Fahsai, Prai-Fon,
Marnmok, and Storm too.

448
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,000
I miss them too.

449
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,360
Can't you still talk to them?

450
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,240
No, I can't. If I could, it would mean
I hadn't really overcome it.

451
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,520
How was I supposed to know
how things worked in there?

452
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,680
You'd just close your eyes,
drop your chin,

453
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,800
and then the other girls would show up.

454
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,560
I was like that? Really?

455
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,520
Yes. Plenty of times, actually.
Like in a movie.

456
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,000
Why don't you try now?

457
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,720
Try?

458
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,400
No. What if it actually works
and I can't undo it?

459
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
What would I do then?

460
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,920
Would you start all over
and hit on me again?

461
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,360
I'm fine with that.

462
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,240
Hey, Sun. I want to sing this song.

463
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,040
Your singing mode's still on?

464
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,120
<i>There might be rain</i>
<i>And thunder in the sky</i>

465
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,640
<i>There might be winds</i>
<i>That twist and terrify</i>

466
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,160
<i>There might be change</i>
<i>That comes from time to time</i>

467
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,000
<i>Please understand</i>

468
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,120
<i>There might be days</i>
<i>Too hot to bear the heat</i>

469
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,480
<i>And icy chills</i>
<i>That come in waves and greet</i>

470
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,040
<i>There might be skies so nice to meet</i>

471
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,640
<i>But not for long</i>

472
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,880
<i>Even so</i>

473
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,040
<i>I want to learn each day more and more</i>

474
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,920
<i>Though I can't guess which way it'll go</i>

475
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,200
<i>Still, I can't help but gaze at the sky</i>

476
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,000
<i>And I'll keep looking as days go by</i>

477
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,320
<i>Through every season, every twist and tide</i>

478
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,240
<i>Still beautiful as always</i>

479
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,320
<i>Just like how I will love no one but you</i>

480
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,800
<i>Because I love every version of you</i>

481
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,600
<i>No matter what weather it is today</i>

482
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,600
<i>My eyes will always find their way</i>

483
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,920
Wow. That is way too sweet.

484
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,360
What the hell are you two doing here?

485
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,200
We're celebrating our anniversary.
Come on.

486
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,600
We're part of your love story too,
aren't we, Sun?

487
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,280
Exactly. How could you two
sneak off and leave us out?

488
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,200
Yeah.

489
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,080
Are you planning
to annoy me all day, Decha?

490
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,880
<i>Still, I can't help but gaze at the sky</i>

491
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,560
<i>And I'll keep looking as days go by</i>

492
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,720
<i>Through every season, every twist and tide</i>

493
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,840
<i>Still beautiful as always…</i>

494
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,120
No one will ever match your type
or preferences perfectly.

495
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,200
Everyone has their own identity

496
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,560
and unique mix of traits within them.

497
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,640
If you like…

498
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,320
or love someone,

499
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,080
let it be for who they truly are.

500
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,720
Love them as the version they are.

501
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,520
That's the best.

502
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,200
One, two, three.

503
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,600
Oh, sorry.

504
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,560
Cut!

505
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,240
Come wipe it off. Wipe it off.

506
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,480
- Right here.
- Wipe it off.

507
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,360
- Whoa! Wait!
- Let me go first.

508
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,640
Bro!

509
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,640
Keep rolling, okay?

510
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,040
Just as chaotic as the beginning.

511
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,520
- It's spoiled.
- All right. Let's do it.

512
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,160
- I'm in a rush.
- Let me go before you.

513
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,600
- No, no, no.
- No, no.

514
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,760
No!

515
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,720
That's too accurate!

516
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,640
No!

517
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,960
Let's cut.

518
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,880
No!

519
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,040
Do we have it in storage?

520
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,960
Do you want it?

521
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,640
What's with that? Why did you have to…?

522
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,560
Sorry!

523
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,000
Sorry. I did that automatically.

524
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,720
Hello!

525
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,680
Boom!

526
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,280
Take this with you, just in case.

527
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,080
It's good stuff.

528
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,880
Oh, shit! My eyes!

529
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,040
Cut.

530
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,840
- Damn it. It hurts my eyes!
- I shouldn't have turned it on. Sorry.

531
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,320
Wanna kiss? Like fitness couples do.

532
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,960
Ugh, shit, did you wash?

533
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,200
Get me a drink, I'll give you 1,000.

534
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,080
He just improvised anything
he wanted. Seriously!

535
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,720
After the truth came out that day,

536
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,920
Boss Thep spit quite a lot.

537
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,600
Cut.

538
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,120
It should be "spilled," right?

539
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,120
Spilled? What did I say?

540
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,560
- "Spit."
- Damn.

541
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,800
After the truth came out that day,

542
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,280
Boss Thep spit quite a lot--
spilled, sorry!

543
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,200
Spilled.

544
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,520
- Spilled, spilled!
- Spilled.

545
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,560
After that day,
Boss Thep spit quite a lot.

546
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,000
Spilled.

547
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,040
- Shit, I kept forgetting it.
- Spilled, dear.

548
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,440
That's okay.

549
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,320
"To be in the live…"
No, that's wrong.

550
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,720
"To live in the body…"

551
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,840
Let me do it again.
I can do it now. Sorry.

552
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,760
"To live in the body of…" what?

553
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,560
"To live in the body of a survivor…"

554
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,680
Let's do it again!

555
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,880
One more time, please. My tongue twisted.

556
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,200
- Just go slowly.
- All right.

557
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,200
"To live in the body of a survivor,

558
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,280
there's no way to escape the pain…"

559
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,120
Argh! Almost there.

560
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,120
You can breathe slowly right there.

561
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,880
- Noted.
- Camera's rolling.

562
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,920
Cut. Let's take a break.

563
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,920
Okay. Touch-ups!

564
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,360
Action.

565
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,680
Please be mindful of our HbA1C levels.

566
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,840
- I said that with an accent, right?
- All right.

567
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,440
Oh. Shall we go again?
That was quite a loud hit.

568
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,000
- This damn door.
- It went boom!

569
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,400
Sun tricked me into going to his room.

570
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,080
Cut!

571
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,880
Hey, hear me out first.

572
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,200
Hi, everyone.

573
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,400
Can you help me find Storm?

574
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,600
Where is Storm?

575
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,960
I'll record it
and edit it out later, okay?

576
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,000
Action.

577
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,920
That's dirty, girl.

578
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,480
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

579
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,720
It's totally okay.

580
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,280
I'm sorry, wrong side.

581
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,040
It's a right hook,
but you went the other way.

582
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,200
- It should be a right rook.
- I'm confused!

583
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,200
I'm sorry. Can I do it again?
I'm so sorry.

584
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,280
- Cut!
- That was…

585
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,840
- Did that get you?
- I'm fine.

586
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,000
- Hurry. He won't scold you.
- Hurry.

587
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,120
Action!

588
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,160
Thanks so much for helping, everyone.

589
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,920
I really hope this helps
Sairung get better.

590
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,920
I've been waiting for this day
for so long.

591
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,200
If she really does get better,

592
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,960
your theory is going to
medical world shake…

593
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,240
"Medical world shake"?

594
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,960
Are we going with that?

595
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,680
Are we going with that
medical world shake?

596
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,840
Logic.

597
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,640
Shake the entire medical world.
