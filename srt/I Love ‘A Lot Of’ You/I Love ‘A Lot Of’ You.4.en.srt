1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,080
<i>Will you be okay</i>

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,000
<i>if I want you in the ring with me?</i>

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,000
<i>That mentor you mentioned…</i>

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
<i>Why do you want to learn from him?</i>
<i>Is he that good?</i>

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,800
<i>I want to talk to him more.</i>

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,280
What was that drink? It's insanely strong.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,520
In the real-time sound, I heard Sairung
keep mumbling that she's drunk.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,320
I don't know what's going on with her.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,200
Sairung, you okay there?

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,800
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,040
<i>I won't run from anyone again.</i>

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,680
What type do I seem like, then?

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,800
Cute.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,680
This is the first time

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,280
I've seen a candid photo
of myself like this.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,560
<i>Let's take a photo.</i>

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,760
How did I get here?

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,080
Marnmok?

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
How did I get here?

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,880
Marnmok?

21
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Yes.

22
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,240
How did I get here?

23
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,760
Hey, calm down.

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
Don't come near me. Stay back!

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,080
Take it easy.

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,280
Sairung had a bit of a situation,
so I brought her here to rest.

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,760
Just to rest? Then why sit that close?

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,040
Come on, it's a long story.
Hear me out first.

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,040
Don't follow me.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
Hey, wait. Hey!

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,280
Marn!

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,880
Hey.

33
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,640
Hey! Hear me out.

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,320
Why are you so mad at me?

35
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,200
I didn't do anything to your daughter.

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,360
If you didn't,
then why was she that upset?

37
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,640
She came home at 1:00 a.m.,

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,400
and I could already feel her bad mood
before she even walked in.

39
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,880
Is she ever not mad at someone?

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
Hey, I heard that!

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Did Marnmok also tell you
why Sairung ended up in my room?

42
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
She didn't.

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,920
Last night,
Sairung got so drunk at the party

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,360
that she was barely conscious.

45
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,680
I went back to get her out

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,400
and brought her to my room to sober up.

47
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,440
If you don't believe me, ask Gudji.

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
Is that true, Gudji?

49
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,160
Uh… yes.

50
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,040
Then why didn't you tell me?

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
Sun was getting scolded.

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
I wanted to watch.

53
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,360
It was kinda satisfying!

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,959
I saved your daughter.

55
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,680
You call yourself a news editor?
You only read the headlines.

56
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,120
I give you an inch
and you question my work ethic?

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,840
I don't care.

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,280
But keep this in mind,

59
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,280
whatever tricks you're using
to make my daughter fall for you,

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,920
you must not take advantage of her!

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Got it?

62
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,800
Got it.

63
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,240
But honestly,

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't think this plan will work.

65
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,800
What now?
Didn't we already talk this through?

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,680
Well, look.

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,040
How do you see this ending?

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,640
You want all five daughters of yours…

69
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,120
I mean, all five personalities…

70
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,040
to fall in love with me.

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,040
Maybe she'll overcome that condition,
but then what?

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,800
Am I supposed to stay with her?

73
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,800
Or do you want me to break up with her?

74
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,560
What if I do leave

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,920
and it breaks her heart so badly
she goes back to square one?

76
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,520
No.

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
Once she gets through this,
it won't happen again.

78
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,080
There's no way I'd let her
get hurt like that ever again.

79
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,200
Okay now?

80
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,640
What's that supposed to mean?

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,400
Yeah, I wonder too.

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,960
So you're just gonna keep blackmailing me?

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,880
I don't know.

84
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,000
That's hard to answer.

85
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm not thinking that far ahead.

86
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,560
Let's just take it one episode at a time.

87
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,800
We shouldn't reveal future episodes.
That'd be a spoiler.

88
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
Right?

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,160
Okay?

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
Man, this is hard.

91
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
Getting an earful?

92
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,880
I saw you last night.

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,760
What were you doing at my condo?

94
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,440
What are you up to?

95
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,000
Were you following me?

96
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
I wasn't following you.

97
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,320
I was following Sairung.

98
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,960
I don't know what you're up to,

99
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,360
but I think I've figured you out.

100
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,920
Sairung, Marnmok, Storm, Prai-Fon, Fahsai…

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,240
they all have feelings.

102
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
Don't do anything to hurt them.

103
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,400
And what does this have to do with you?

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,360
Who are you to them?

105
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,640
I…

106
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,200
used to be…

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
7 YEARS AGO

108
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,080
Classical dance?
Like Thai classical dance?

109
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,040
<i>I met Sariung in college.</i>

110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,480
<i>She was a charming person.</i>

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
<i>Everything she did had a big effect on me.</i>

112
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,600
<i>I liked her.</i>

113
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,680
<i>She liked me.</i>

114
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,400
<i>So we started dating.</i>

115
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,280
But this whole time,
I didn't know that it was…

116
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
<i>I knew about her multiple personalities.</i>

117
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,480
Sairung.

118
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,080
Sairung?

119
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Sairung!

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,400
<i>But I didn't think it would actually</i>
<i>become an issue.</i>

121
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,720
I never knew when she'd be sweet,

122
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
when she wouldn't trust me,

123
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,920
when she'd be fragile or strong,

124
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,000
or when she'd feel nothing for me at all.

125
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,960
It might sound awful,

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,840
but I admit it.

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,800
I couldn't love all of her personalities.

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,920
Especially Marnmok.

129
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,400
She never gave me space to step in.

130
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,760
Is that why you broke up with her?

131
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,720
Yes.

132
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,240
That's also what caused
Sairung and Marnmok to fight, right?

133
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,400
Yes.

134
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
And I've felt guilty about it ever since.

135
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,360
I don't want Sairung
to go through that again.

136
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,440
So those five girls
agreed to take turns in the light

137
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,640
because that guy, Pat, broke their hearts?

138
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,040
He was probably their first love,
so it hit them hard.

139
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,040
What?

140
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,600
A guy like him broke someone's heart?

141
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,600
My bro here is way better looking.
He's broken way more hearts too.

142
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Seriously?!

143
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,840
Are you a doctor or something?

144
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,880
Why do you keep injecting me
with compliments?

145
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,240
Anyway, I texted you at 1:00 a.m.

146
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,760
Why didn't you reply?

147
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,800
Were you asleep?

148
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,280
Or were you with a girl?

149
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
No girl.

150
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,200
After you texted that Sairung was safe,

151
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,520
Sis Gudji started scolding me
about the pen recorder.

152
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,000
She said it was a privacy violation,
this and that.

153
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,320
She went on for like an hour.

154
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
An hour, really?

155
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,160
Yes. I ordered two bowls of rice soup.

156
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,840
I finished them both
and she was still nagging.

157
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,080
Whoa!

158
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,960
You went out to eat with Gudji?

159
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,200
It was just a meal.

160
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,120
Whoa!

161
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,360
Cut that out. Nothing happened.

162
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,840
Fine, I believe you.

163
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,400
I can't picture it either,

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,840
you and Gudji.

165
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,400
When you crushed her heart,
she even threatened to ruin your future.

166
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,200
If I messed with her too,

167
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,680
she'd probably poison my drink.

168
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,200
I wanted to talk to you about this too.

169
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,680
We need to do something

170
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,160
about that blackmail clip.

171
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
What do you want to do? Erase it?

172
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,880
They've probably backed it up.

173
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,520
I think I've found a way.

174
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
We can't let them blackmail us
and call all the shots.

175
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,920
Everyone has a past.

176
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,920
It's just that

177
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,960
we need someone…

178
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,760
to dig a little to find it.

179
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,560
What do you want?

180
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,880
Stop mumbling. It's annoying.

181
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,840
Sis. I… ah…

182
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,200
If you want one, just say so.

183
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,920
Don't expect people to read your mind.

184
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,880
What are you watching?

185
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Nothing.

186
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,280
I'm just waiting for De.

187
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,640
Don't let me find out
you're secretly planning something.

188
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,920
Come on.

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,440
You still don't trust me?

190
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,960
I really didn't do anything
to you last night.

191
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,160
I even saved you.

192
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,320
We have another interview this afternoon.
Go get your camera ready.

193
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,840
Make sure it doesn't overheat again.

194
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,080
Who are we interviewing today?

195
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,760
Didn't you check your email?

196
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,880
Just focus on your camera.

197
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,520
Make sure it doesn't overheat again.

198
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,600
Okay, ma'am.

199
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,120
It won't overheat this time.

200
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Last time, I was just looking at you.

201
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,600
Why were you looking at me?

202
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,040
When you're so into your work,

203
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,000
it's captivating.

204
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,160
Hey, listen.

205
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,920
You don't need
to cross your arms around me.

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,240
I'm not going to hurt you.

207
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,240
The government's fertility-boosting policy
doesn't align with today's cost of living.

208
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,880
So we're interviewing people
in the industry to get their take on it.

209
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,760
Next time, check your email.

210
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,080
What happened?

211
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,640
It's probably stuck.

212
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,600
Hello? Somebody help.

213
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,000
We're stuck in here.

214
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,560
Hey, take it easy.

215
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,200
Hello.

216
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,960
Help, we're in the elevator.

217
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,000
Hello!

218
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,200
<i>There's an issue with the elevator system.</i>
<i>Please give us a moment.</i>

219
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,120
Wow, sis.

220
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,560
This is so good.
The sweet dip is amazing, sis.

221
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,360
- You made it yourself?
- Yeah.

222
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,920
It's just me here. Who else?

223
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,240
Sell this.

224
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,760
Go sell this!

225
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,880
It's seriously good.

226
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,760
You really nailed this dip, sis.

227
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,920
When I had the green mango
on its own, I was like,

228
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,520
"Way too sour."

229
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,960
But with this sweet dip?

230
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,080
Wow.

231
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
It's mellow, smooth-o, ding-ding!

232
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Come on.

233
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,360
You and your weird wording…

234
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,880
Seriously, how did you land
a journalism job?

235
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,920
You already know.

236
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,200
I didn't come here by choice.

237
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,400
What about you?

238
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,280
How'd you end up working here?

239
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,960
I studied this field, so I applied
for jobs in this line of work.

240
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,720
What's so strange about that?
Your job's the weird one.

241
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,360
Can I ask you something?

242
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,080
Why'd you take on this kind of gig?

243
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,400
I just needed to make money.

244
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,160
Whoever hires me, I do the job.

245
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,680
But Sun,

246
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,960
he's the real specialist.

247
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,960
Then…

248
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,000
why did Sun take on this kind of job?

249
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,120
<i>We're still working on it.</i>
<i>Please hang in there a little longer.</i>

250
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,320
But it's been a while
since we called for help.

251
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,600
Please hurry.

252
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
We've got things to do.

253
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,440
This is getting annoying.

254
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,200
Do they even know what they're doing?

255
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,080
Hey, can you breathe a little quieter?
We've got limited air in here.

256
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,640
Sun!

257
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,320
Sun…

258
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,960
Calm down.

259
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,800
Pull yourself together.

260
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,000
Try to pull yourself together.

261
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,520
Calm down.

262
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
Why did Sun take on this kind of job?

263
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
<i>Well,</i>

264
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
<i>Sun was kind of an unexpected child.</i>

265
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,680
Are you okay with it overall?

266
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,880
Totally!

267
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,280
You're really impressive.

268
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,400
If everything's good, how about
we go ahead and sign the contract?

269
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,079
There's just one thing though.

270
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,720
You brought your little one along,

271
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
so we couldn't really talk in detail.

272
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,080
There was no one at home,
so I had to bring him.

273
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,320
But if you're interested in
buying two units,

274
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,600
I might be able to find some time
to go over the details with you.

275
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,280
Like, in full detail.

276
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,440
Do you want me to get you a new toy?

277
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,640
I've seen you playing with that one
for months now.

278
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,480
What's wrong?

279
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,360
Don't you want anything?

280
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,320
I don't want you to do this job anymore.

281
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,240
That old man grabbed your hand.

282
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,040
I don't like it.

283
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,080
Sun, I have to make a living.

284
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,640
Don't make a big deal out of it.

285
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,040
Do all my friends' moms
have to do this too?

286
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,520
Everyone's life is different.

287
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,200
There's no point comparing.

288
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,520
Sun.

289
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,600
I know you're a smart boy.

290
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,200
You know what's right and wrong.

291
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,320
Sometimes, life doesn't give you
many choices.

292
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,640
I have to earn a living.

293
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,040
There are many ways to do that.

294
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,000
We may even have to trade off
what we have.

295
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,640
And I don't think that's wrong.

296
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,560
Come on. You'll understand
when you're older.

297
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,520
Let's go. Let's get something to eat.

298
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,400
- How about pizza?
- Pizza, yes!

299
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,560
Let's go.

300
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
Going up.

301
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,800
Can I have ice cream after pizza?

302
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,920
Sure.

303
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,680
Your son?

304
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,120
He's cute.

305
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,600
Is it just the two of you?

306
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,480
It's just the two of us.

307
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,880
Where are you two going?

308
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,080
No plans yet.

309
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,360
Aren't we going for pizza, Mom?

310
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,760
What brings you here?

311
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,200
Just meeting a friend to catch up.

312
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,320
What about you?

313
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,000
I sell units here.

314
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,400
Got any nice rooms left for me?

315
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,040
Any specific type you're looking for?

316
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm interested in all types.

317
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,800
Please calm down.

318
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,360
Calm down.

319
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,920
Slow your breathing.

320
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,680
Pull yourself together.

321
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,520
I'm right here.

322
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,560
Slow your breathing.

323
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
Pull yourself together.

324
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,960
I'm right here.

325
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm right here, all right?

326
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,200
Someone's coming.

327
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,400
Stay calm.

328
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,000
Help him first. He's not well.

329
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,800
Are you okay now?

330
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,160
I'm okay.

331
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
Should we go?

332
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,800
- Our sources might've been waiting…
- You're really okay?

333
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
I'm okay.

334
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,240
Thanks.

335
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,800
If it weren't for you,
I could've been in real trouble.

336
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Then don't let yourself get to that point.

337
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Next time, if you're not feeling well,
say something right away. Got it?

338
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,280
I'm thinking of canceling
today's interview.

339
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,800
Why? Didn't our sources wait?

340
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,560
You almost died in the elevator,

341
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,600
and you still want to work?

342
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,880
Besides, if something happens to you,
I'm the one who gets in real trouble.

343
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,920
Oh, I get it.

344
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,760
You're just worried about
getting in trouble,

345
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,920
not about me, right?

346
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,760
That's right.

347
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,960
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

348
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,920
Hey.

349
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,160
Let's do our work.

350
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,080
I'm really okay now.

351
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
You sure?

352
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm sure.

353
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,440
Then move.

354
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,240
What do you think about the government…

355
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,920
I disagree.

356
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,920
Well, if our infrastructure isn't ready…

357
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,080
Hey, Sun. Back up the file and send it
to me right away, okay?

358
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,560
- I'll finalize it and pass it to editing.
- Got it.

359
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
Not heading home yet?

360
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm just about to.

361
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
What's wrong, Sun?

362
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,560
Got a cramp in your lips?

363
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,320
Buzz off.

364
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,320
Wow, really?

365
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,680
Marnmok saved you there?

366
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,880
Yeah.

367
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
With that all-day grumpy face of hers.

368
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,760
Honestly, with someone like her,

369
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,120
letting me die would've made more sense!

370
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,560
That's a bit much.

371
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,840
But isn't it clear now?

372
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,440
No matter which personality it is,

373
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,080
the conscience behind
all five personalities is the same.

374
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,920
They have hearts. They feel.
They can love.

375
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
They can hurt, just like us.

376
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,800
Did you go talk to a monk today?

377
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,480
Didn't I tell you to talk to Gudji?

378
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,040
Why do you suddenly sound like
a walking Dharma book?

379
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,440
It's not Dharma talk.

380
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,720
I'm just trying to put myself
in her shoes.

381
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,520
Sun.

382
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,680
Seriously…

383
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,640
Do you ever feel guilty
doing this kind of work?

384
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,040
After talking to Sis Gudji today,

385
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,080
I feel even more guilty.

386
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,000
To you guys,

387
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,600
feelings might not seem like a big deal.

388
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
But for me,

389
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,880
just a girl on her own,

390
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,360
every single feeling matters, you know?

391
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,360
Even when I watch movies.

392
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,920
When Tony Stark died,
I cried for three days,

393
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,760
and I knew it wasn't even real.

394
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,760
At the time,

395
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,560
even though I knew I was being played,

396
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,160
when Sun ditched me, it still hurt.

397
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,080
So imagine

398
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,680
how someone who doesn't even realize
they're being lied to would feel.

399
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,360
How devastated they would be.

400
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,040
What if you actually get all five of
Sairung's personalities to fall for you?

401
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,640
Then what? You're gonna ditch her
like you did with the other clients?

402
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,960
Should we just stop now, Sun?

403
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,760
I understand where you're coming from, De.

404
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,040
But my gut says…

405
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,720
it's gonna turn out good this time.

406
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,080
THE FILE IS COMPLETE AND GOOD TO USE

407
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,360
<i>I have no idea either, but…</i>

408
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,240
I have a feeling it's gonna be
a good ending.

409
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,320
<i>I've never really gotten jealous before.</i>

410
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,200
I know we are not a thing.

411
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,080
But I didn't like
how he talked to you back there.

412
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,760
What type do I seem like, then?

413
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,400
Cute.

414
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,880
At first,

415
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,040
I thought I felt this way
only for Sairung.

416
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Holy shit!

417
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,800
Sun…

418
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,200
Are you in love?

419
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,760
Hey, Sun.

420
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,200
Letting emotions in like this
will make it hard to do your job.

421
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,880
Why are you putting your heart into it?
You know it's just a job.

422
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,480
I can't say what'll happen in the future,

423
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,280
but what I do know is that everything
I'm about to do from now on,

424
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,960
I'm doing because
I genuinely care about her.

425
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,520
You know what, bro?

426
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,560
Seeing an asshole show they've got a heart

427
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,200
makes me so happy I could float.

428
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,880
I'll pull you right back down,

429
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,120
you little shit!

430
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,840
- It was a compliment. A compliment.
- A compliment or a dig?!

431
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,600
What about the task I gave you?
Did you get anything?

432
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,480
It's me.

433
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,600
Of course I did.

434
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
I got both

435
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,360
a smile

436
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,560
<i>and a ball of sunshine.</i>

437
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,280
<i>And once I got closer,</i>

438
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,040
<i>I realized…</i>

439
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,960
she's actually kind of cute.

440
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
I paid for Premium. Skip the ad.

441
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,920
Get to the point!

442
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,960
All right, got it.

443
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,400
So here it is.

444
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,720
Sis Gudji told me

445
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,720
that Boss Thep used to be
a big-name newspaper journalist.

446
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,880
He worked on investigative scoops
over 20 years ago.

447
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,800
Why so many questions?
Digging for information?

448
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,680
No! I'm not digging for anything.

449
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,800
I work here. He's my boss.

450
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,680
I should know about him.

451
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,360
What he likes, what he doesn't.

452
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,600
Usually, office workers gossip
about their bosses all the time.

453
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,840
You think everyone in the world
gossips about their boss?

454
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,360
That's absolutely true!

455
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,240
What's more entertaining at work
than that?

456
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,080
From what I've heard,

457
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,880
Boss Thep didn't used to be like this.

458
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,840
But after his wife died
and Sairung turned out the way she did,

459
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,080
he completely fell apart.

460
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
He quit his job
to raise his daughter alone.

461
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,880
Isn't all that information that
everyone already knows?

462
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,440
Just the intro, baby.
What everyone knows is about Sairung.

463
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,800
But the cause of his wife's death…

464
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,200
- His wife's death?
- Yes.

465
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,120
An accident?

466
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,960
She took her own life?

467
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,040
Yes.

468
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,520
I was shocked when I heard it too.

469
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,800
Boss Thep has never shared
the details himself.

470
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,360
People who do know mostly just feel
sorry for both father and daughter.

471
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,400
It was this dramatic,

472
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,760
so no one really wanted to dig any deeper.

473
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,560
<i>His wife died,</i>

474
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
and no one looked into the cause?

475
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Why?

476
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,960
Maybe they respected his decision.

477
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,680
Or maybe they just wanted to forget.

478
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,600
That might be true for anyone else.

479
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
But this is Theppachai
we're talking about.

480
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
You know he doesn't give up that easily.

481
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,920
And he was a journalist.

482
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,160
That instinct to dig
has to still be there.

483
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,560
So you think it's strange?

484
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,040
Yeah, kind of.

485
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,240
Anyway, keep looking into it for me.

486
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,080
But does someone dying a long time ago
really have anything to do with us?

487
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,440
It does.

488
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,640
This is the man
holding our lives in his hands.

489
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,440
And the story's already strange enough.

490
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,480
If we find something that explains
what's going on with Sairung,

491
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,160
it might actually make our job easier.

492
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,880
In that case, where should I start?

493
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,240
Start with the basics.

494
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,560
Look up any news related to the case.

495
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,240
I'll check in with a more reliable source.

496
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
You have a source?

497
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,240
She's not exactly that into me yet,

498
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,600
but… she's at least the one who's
opened up to me the most so far.

499
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,280
Now, please make your way out.

500
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,800
We've still got some posters left.

501
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,160
What's your order?

502
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,880
- There are three designs.
- Three mugs, please.

503
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,800
One XL, please.

504
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,480
The print on the shirt is like this.

505
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,680
This one's XL.

506
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,160
Ugh, am I gonna get them?

507
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,120
Please, let me get them! Please, please.

508
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,880
Please leave me the T-shirt, the cards,
and the autograph too!

509
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,200
Let's do this.

510
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,160
While we're waiting in line,

511
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,280
show me if you can solve
the Rubik's cube the way I taught you.

512
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,840
Trust me, if you can do it,

513
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,840
you're gonna have good luck today.

514
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,600
Yes. Here, the mug.

515
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,640
All right.

516
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,520
For the soap, if you start using it…

517
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,480
Almost there.

518
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,520
Come on.

519
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,120
You've got this.

520
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,120
You've got this!

521
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,040
You did it!

522
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,320
T-SHIRTS SOLD OUT

523
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,400
You remembered what I taught you.
Well done.

524
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,239
I'm happy about it,

525
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,760
but I still missed out on the shirt!

526
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,560
Who says you missed out?

527
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,840
You pulled it off.
You deserve a reward, right?

528
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,239
Turns out, each person can buy
up to two T-shirts.

529
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,199
And luckily,

530
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
we've got a kind-hearted fellow fan here.

531
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,920
Well, you did beg with tears in your eyes.

532
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,800
Hey, we've gotta help each other out.

533
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,600
You said it was for your girlfriend…

534
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,040
I just added a little flair to the story.

535
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,560
…who has terminal cancer and is dying.

536
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,920
A bit of drama

537
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,160
makes it more believable.

538
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,600
- You think I actually believed all that?
- Then why'd you sell it to me?

539
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,640
Money, duh. You paid so much.
Of course I sold it.

540
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,000
Cancer, really?

541
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,840
Whoa…

542
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,560
But props for the effort.

543
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,520
With lies that smooth, he could
be a con artist. Be careful.

544
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,560
Enough, lady.

545
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,840
Anyway, I really appreciate this.

546
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,760
It's been a long time
since anyone's been this kind to me.

547
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,520
The last person might've been my mom.

548
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,760
You seemed really close to your mom.

549
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,600
Close?

550
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
I'm not sure.

551
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,440
It's like…

552
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,800
my memories of her are faded.

553
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,080
Like, I kind of remember,

554
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,360
but it feels like jump cuts.

555
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,040
<i>Just broken fragments here and there.</i>

556
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,040
<i>I think each of us</i>
<i>only remembers a piece of her.</i>

557
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,320
But that day, it was really great.

558
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,760
Being with her, just the two of us.

559
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,280
Can I play it too?

560
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,640
Can I play it too?

561
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,840
If I could turn back time,

562
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,120
I'd go back there again.

563
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,160
Maybe I'd remember more about my mom.

564
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Where is that?

565
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,360
A park.

566
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,320
My mom took me there to ride a bike.

567
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,440
Wanna go there together?

568
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,240
Yeah.

569
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,680
I'd love to.

570
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,840
How about this Saturday?

571
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,760
Saturday's good.

572
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,840
Hey.

573
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,280
It's raining.

574
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,000
Let's go.

575
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
Why are you smiling?

576
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,240
Am I doing anything like
what your mom did again?

577
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,800
No.

578
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,600
No one has ever done
something like this for me.

579
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,400
Thank you so much.

580
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,360
Let's go.

581
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,440
Losing her mom like that…

582
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,920
It must've been devastating.

583
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,560
She was still just a kid.

584
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,760
She probably built a wall
to keep out all the bad feelings…

585
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,280
and then the painful memories faded too.

586
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,960
Have you become a therapist now?

587
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,120
I'm not some expert or anything.

588
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,600
I just feel sorry for her.

589
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,800
Think about it.

590
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,680
What must she have gone through

591
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,960
to break into
five different personalities?

592
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,160
Good thing Fahsai has started
to open up to me.

593
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,040
Otherwise, I'd barely understand her.

594
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,880
But you're meeting Prai-Fon tomorrow.

595
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,320
Have you figured out what you're gonna do?

596
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,440
She's just as hard to understand.

597
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,000
Don't tell me

598
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,080
you already have a plan?

599
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,440
The best plan is no plan.

600
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,000
With someone like Prai-Fon,
you've gotta take it slow.

601
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,200
If you want someone
to open their heart to you,

602
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,720
you've got to give yours first.

603
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,080
Handsome. Cool. Smart.

604
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,560
Sharp.

605
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,000
And sincere too.

606
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,080
It's sincerity

607
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,280
that will open the way for me.

608
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,440
<i>I can sense that Sun is approaching her</i>
<i>with a hidden agenda.</i>

609
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,760
And I can sense that you've got
some strange intentions here too.

610
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,680
Are you free today?

611
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,200
Why?

612
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,920
<i>I want to take you to study outside.</i>

613
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,840
<i>If you do bad things,</i>
<i>the law won't go easy on you.</i>

614
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,960
Before you became a boxing coach,
what did you do?

615
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,600
Are you digging into Kritsana?

616
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,240
<i>You should stay out of this.</i>

617
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,360
<i>If what I believe is true,</i>

618
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,080
I might be able to overcome
this dissociative identity disorder.
