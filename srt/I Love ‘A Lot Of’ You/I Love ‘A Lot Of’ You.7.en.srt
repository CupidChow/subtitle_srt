1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,600
What does all of this have to do with
your mom's suicide?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,960
Mom didn't kill herself.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,600
Mom didn't kill herself.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,840
- Fahsai.
- She didn't. Mom wasn't a coward.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,960
Then who did, Fahsai?

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,320
- Mom didn't kill herself. She didn't.
- Who did? Fahsai!

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,640
<i>This matter doesn't concern you.</i>

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,080
Marnmok?

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,600
Have you been secretly following us
while we're in the light?

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,760
Quit trying to be our mom.

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,200
It's because I lost Mom!

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,080
That's why I can't bear to lose
any of you again!

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,840
<i>Stop being afraid already, Marnmok.</i>

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,120
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,680
I think I do.

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,200
All right then.

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,600
You're my boyfriend from this second on.

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,680
- I want you to take a look at this.
- That's Coach Chatch!

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,760
Does Storm know about this?

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,000
Why are you following me?

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,160
BODY FOUND BY RIVERBANK
MOTIVE REMAINS UNCLEAR

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,640
Come on in, girl.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,520
Whatever you want to know,
come ask it close to my face.

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,680
That's dirty, girl.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Damn!

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,600
Answer me. What did you do before?

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,760
Dirty work, right?

28
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,240
What the hell do you want?

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,880
I want the truth.

30
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,880
Truth my ass!

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,920
What did you do 19 years ago?!

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,880
19 years…
What the heck are you talking about?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,400
Do you seriously remember
what you did that long ago?

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,440
Did you kill someone?

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,920
Are you the kid of someone I took out?

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,640
And now want revenge?

37
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,360
Good. I'll take you to my boss.

38
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
You okay?

39
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,280
What the…?

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,360
Who the hell are you guys?

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,080
- Her ex.
- Huh?

42
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,600
- Her new boyfriend.
- Wait.

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,760
All right.

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,120
Why not all come in at once?

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
Take this with you.

46
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,200
If they can't see you,

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,640
they can't hit you, right?

48
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
Damn it.

49
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,680
Who the hell is this now?

50
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,440
My name is De.

51
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,360
Come on. You all can just
come at me at once.

52
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,360
Sun, take this.

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,920
Can't you toss it more gently?

54
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,880
Okay, got it.

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,520
Sun, take this.

56
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
You're dead.

57
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,200
De.

58
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
De.

59
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,600
De.

60
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
De!

61
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,480
De. Hey, call an ambulance now.

62
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,960
De, stay calm.

63
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,920
We need an ambulance right now.
Someone got stabbed.

64
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,720
Stay with me, De.

65
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,280
Why can't I find the wound?

66
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,560
There's no wound.

67
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,280
I don't feel any pain.

68
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,400
Then whose blood is this?

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,160
Who got stabbed?

70
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
- Sun. Sun!
- Sun!

71
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,640
Sun. Sun. Sun.

72
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,520
- Hey. Hey!
- Sun. Sun.

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,960
- Sun. Sun.
- Sun!

74
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,640
Sun! Sun!

75
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,520
Sun!

76
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,520
Hello, yes?

77
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,880
We're outside the emergency room.

78
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,920
You can come in.

79
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,680
Sweetie, you all right?

80
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,720
Yes, Dad. I'm okay.

81
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,400
And you?

82
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm okay. Just a few bruises.

83
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I'm okay too.

84
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,080
But Sun, Dad…

85
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,400
What were you all doing?

86
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,080
Can someone tell me what happened?

87
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,680
It was an accident.

88
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,320
Well…

89
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,440
I got into a bit of trouble.

90
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,400
Sun and the others came to help,

91
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,840
and Sun took the hit.

92
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,800
A bit of trouble?

93
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,760
How's that "a bit"? Do explain.

94
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,680
De? Are you okay?

95
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,320
How did you end up there?

96
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,800
You little fool.
You nearly got yourself killed.

97
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,040
Next time, run. Got it?

98
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,080
De!

99
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
You got stabbed?

100
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,480
That's a huge tear.

101
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,840
Should we get a doctor? Doesn't it hurt?

102
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,840
Sis.

103
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,360
It only got my shirt.

104
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,240
I dodged it in time.

105
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,200
But because I dodged it,

106
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,800
Sun took the hit.

107
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,640
Hey! Tell me straight.

108
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
What did you want from that boxing coach?

109
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,040
Why were you following him so closely?

110
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,600
Shouldn't you all be worrying
about Sun right now?

111
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,960
I also want to know what you were doing.

112
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,600
What I want to know more is
what they did in the past!

113
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
"They"?

114
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,080
Who?

115
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,920
Storm, I've been doing
everything I can to keep you safe.

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,920
Do you understand?

117
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
Are you getting yourself
into something dangerous?

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
If you are, step back right now.

119
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,040
If you don't have the guts to do it, fine.

120
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,920
Don't worry.

121
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,400
I can take care of myself.

122
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,160
So Storm's digging into Kritsana too?

123
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,680
And who's the boxing coach you mentioned?

124
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,400
BODY OF MIDDLE-AGED
REAL ESTATE TYCOON FOUND BY RIVERBANK

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
Holy shit!

126
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,400
He's a hitman?

127
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,000
Gosh.

128
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,480
I'm worried about Storm, De.

129
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,960
That's why I wanted to quit.

130
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,600
I've had a bad feeling about this
for a while.

131
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,320
Now that I think about it,

132
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,280
if Sun, Pat, and you hadn't stepped in,

133
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,400
Storm would have been the one in the ER.

134
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,120
Keep looking out for her, okay?

135
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,640
Seriously, sis.

136
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,520
Right now, the love team
has turned into detectives.

137
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,720
They've gone from breaking hearts
to getting stabbed in the heart instead.

138
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,240
But you made it through,
didn't you, kiddo?

139
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,520
Have… you been sober since that night?

140
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,440
That night…

141
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,360
Which night?

142
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
The night you were on your period

143
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,040
and drank until you lost your mind.

144
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,880
I had a terrible hangover.

145
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,520
You should've stopped me from drinking!

146
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,520
Do you remember anything?

147
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,520
I was on my period.

148
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,760
It was red everywhere.

149
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,040
I was crying, ranting about my love life.

150
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,360
And…

151
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,400
And what else?

152
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,240
I slammed the table.
I chugged all the beers.

153
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,640
I felt like I wanted to kill Sun.

154
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,000
And…

155
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,760
We kissed! Ptooey!

156
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,200
<i>Come back, Sun's awake.</i>

157
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,640
Sun's awake.

158
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Hurry up then.

159
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,920
The patient has woken up.

160
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,200
You two wait here.
Let me be with him alone first.

161
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,560
- Here, your water.
- How's Sun?

162
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
My dad's with him.

163
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
How are you holding up?

164
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,080
Thanks for helping me, by the way.

165
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm okay.

166
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,960
What matters is you're safe.

167
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
Anyway, why were you following me?

168
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,320
Well,

169
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,120
I was actually following Sun
because he was following you.

170
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,440
Honestly, something feels off about Sun.

171
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,000
Like he's not here for the job,
but has some other agenda.

172
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,120
So I was tracking him.

173
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,480
Without him,
I would've been in serious trouble.

174
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,040
Are you still digging into
what happened 19 years ago?

175
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,680
You do know that
has always been on my mind.

176
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,560
Don't tell me to stop like my dad did.

177
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,440
I'll keep digging
until I get to the bottom of it.

178
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm not telling you to stop.

179
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Keep going until you get
to the bottom of it.

180
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,360
A wound in the heart, if left untreated,

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,360
just keeps hurting.

182
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,080
No one wants to get hurt
for the rest of their life.

183
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,320
Am I right?

184
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,520
Maybe

185
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,400
the one who might make
all these personalities disappear

186
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,520
could be Sun.

187
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,640
No.

188
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,480
It's the truth about your mother's death
that'll help you heal.

189
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,440
That's it.

190
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
I just want to say,
go all the way through with it.

191
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,280
If you ever need my help,
just let me know.

192
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,120
I'm on your team.

193
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,960
You're done?

194
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,960
Let me see him first.

195
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,160
Ouch!

196
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,320
Why are you laughing, you fool?

197
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,880
Now I get why funny people
shouldn't visit patients.

198
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,080
What's so funny?

199
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,640
Look at how you apologized.

200
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,680
Well, I feel guilty.

201
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,680
I got there too late.

202
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,880
You took quite a few hits yourself.

203
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,160
Does it hurt?

204
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,880
Before you start worrying
about other people,

205
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,440
worry about your own self first.

206
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
I'll be fine.

207
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,000
But next time,
if you want to do something like this,

208
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,600
don't go in alone.

209
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,000
Just let me know.

210
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,120
I'm on your team.

211
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,600
You need to get my daughter
out of this mess completely

212
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,520
before things get even worse.

213
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,280
Why?

214
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,000
You're lying in a hospital bed like this.
Isn't that clear enough for you?

215
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,600
Remember, your only job is
to flirt with my daughter,

216
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,920
make her feel good,

217
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,480
and let love heal
what she's going through.

218
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,760
That's your only job.

219
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,480
As for everything else,

220
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,880
it's my family matter.

221
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,240
Don't forget.

222
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,240
I can expose you anytime.

223
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,440
Consider this your warning.

224
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,760
Finding out the truth about your mother
must be really important to you.

225
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,760
Really, really important.

226
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,880
You also don't believe…

227
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,200
that your mother took her own life?

228
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,560
It feels unresolved

229
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,680
because…

230
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,360
the mother I knew

231
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
was a brave person.

232
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,600
She was so much stronger than that.

233
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,720
She was too strong…

234
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,200
to kill herself.

235
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,120
A murder?

236
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,280
If that's true,

237
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,000
then what you're doing is dangerous.

238
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,119
If your mom were alive…

239
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,880
would she want you
putting yourself in danger like this?

240
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,280
It's okay to be scared, Storm.

241
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,360
You don't always have to be strong.

242
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,840
Fight.

243
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,880
Wanna fight this together?

244
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,800
Of course.

245
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,600
But let me get out of here first.

246
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
Is this your way of waking me up?

247
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,360
You're awake?

248
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,120
You slept like you were hit
with an elephant tranquilizer.

249
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,240
That was probably
the longest I've ever slept.

250
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,840
Does it hurt?

251
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,800
See?

252
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,560
Was that necessary?

253
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,840
It doesn't hurt that bad.

254
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,720
Thank you so much for saving Storm.

255
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,040
I don't know how she ended up
in something like that.

256
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,160
Because…

257
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,240
I don't know either.

258
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,400
We may find the culprit soon.

259
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,120
Can I ask you something?

260
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,160
Shoot!

261
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,320
Why do you believe that your mother
didn't take her own life?

262
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,000
Because she wasn't that kind of person.

263
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,400
Though I was small, I remember

264
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,880
how serious and strong she was.

265
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,760
And she made so many promises to me.

266
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,600
There's no way
she'd forget all of that so easily.

267
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,680
I hope what you believe is true.

268
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,880
For you.

269
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,880
And…

270
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,200
I've got a surprise.

271
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,200
Give me a moment.

272
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,200
Our scars have the power to remind us
that the past was real.

273
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,680
Prai-Fon?

274
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,080
Don't be too shocked.

275
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,200
We've already agreed on how each of us
gets to come out in the light.

276
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,560
If we didn't come to visit
the person who saved Storm,

277
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,080
that'd be too heartless.

278
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,320
Such a shame though.

279
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,720
I only ever get to read fight scenes
in novels.

280
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,400
If I had been there that day,
seen it with my own eyes,

281
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,360
that would've been a level-up for my life.

282
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,080
Am I a case study in your life now?

283
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,080
It's a good thing
you didn't experience it yourself.

284
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,120
Real-life danger is real sometimes.

285
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,760
You're better off reading about it
in your books.

286
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,640
Here.

287
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,280
While you're here,

288
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,080
let the world in the books
keep moving for you.

289
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,800
Prai-Fon.

290
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,720
I saw you trying to search the news
from 19 years ago.

291
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,680
Does it have something to do
with your mother?

292
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,880
Do you know about my family?

293
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,000
It was that day with you at the library.

294
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,760
There's some unresolved feeling
in my mind.

295
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Let's just say that
if I ever get the answer for this,

296
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,200
you'll be one of the first to know.

297
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,680
Hey. Hurry up and get better already.

298
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,200
Storm, weren't you out
in the light yesterday?

299
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,880
This is a special occasion.

300
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,280
Why? You're afraid of getting hurt again
by seeing me?

301
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
It's not that.

302
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,640
I'm just waiting for someone
to come make it up to me.

303
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,440
Close your eyes.

304
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,520
Time to eat.

305
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,520
Eat it.

306
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,480
You feel so guilty you think you need
to take care of me like this?

307
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,520
Just eat.

308
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,800
I don't even do this for my dad, you know.

309
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,040
I know. Never doubted it.

310
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,920
Seeing you in the light
in Fahsai's clothes

311
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,000
is kind of a refreshing change.

312
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,280
I know, right?
I'm not comfortable in this either.

313
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,480
You should wear this
to the boxing gym sometime.

314
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,560
Do I look like someone to mess with?

315
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,840
Watch it.

316
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,360
The next one is Sairung, then.

317
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
This is getting fun.

318
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,720
Sairung asked to be the one
to take you home.

319
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,720
What about Marnmok?

320
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,800
Do you think she'll actually come?

321
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,680
But don't read too much into it.

322
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,000
She probably has her own reasons.

323
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,640
Here's your medicine.

324
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,880
Please get some rest too.

325
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,360
I'm about to leave anyway.

326
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,080
You rest up.

327
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,680
See you at the gym.

328
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,280
<i>Having you, even if I'm scared,</i>
<i>I won't be fighting alone anymore.</i>

329
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,560
THE MINDS OF BILLY MILLIGAN

330
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,600
It's you all

331
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,680
who need to go together.

332
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,760
If you're not resting yet,
mind if I visit you now?

333
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,560
Thanks for visiting me.

334
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,320
But I doubt that's the only reason
you're here.

335
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,520
You've got a lot of get-well gifts
from just one person.

336
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,760
I haven't even thanked you for helping me.

337
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,720
But what I really want to know more is…

338
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
why were you following me?

339
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,440
What were you after?

340
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,000
I should be the one asking that.
What are you really after?

341
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,480
You applied to work with us,
dragged De along,

342
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,840
and got close to Sairung like that.

343
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,560
Do I need to answer all that?

344
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,400
I'm just worried about Sairung
and the other personalities.

345
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,160
If you really care about her,
then make her stop digging into this.

346
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,600
I won't.

347
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,120
Do you know something about
what they're trying to find out?

348
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,080
If you know it's dangerous,

349
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,880
shouldn't you warn them?

350
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,520
She must not stop
looking into this matter.

351
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,080
I believe if she finds out the truth,
she'll become whole again.

352
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,160
And I've already made up my mind…

353
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
I'm going to try
winning Sairung's heart again.

354
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,440
This time,

355
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,000
it won't end like before.

356
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,160
Oh, and one more thing, Mr. Sun.

357
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,640
If I find out your intentions
toward them aren't genuine,

358
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,520
the trust they have in you?

359
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,480
It'll be gone for good.

360
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,400
Where's Sairung?

361
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,320
Why hasn't she visited me at all?

362
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
So mean.

363
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,280
You had three ladies visit you,
all with the same face.

364
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,640
Still not enough to make up for Sairung?

365
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,280
Hey, I didn't hear you ask for Marnmok.

366
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,800
She might feel hurt, you know.

367
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,400
If she comes,
there might be a flood today.

368
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,240
Just go in.

369
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,200
A grand entrance, as always.

370
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,640
Long time no see, huh?

371
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,560
Recovery at the condo is boring.

372
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,040
Why don't you come with me?

373
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
Knock yourself out.

374
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,120
But taste it first
as it might be too spicy.

375
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,280
This is my favorite place.

376
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,000
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's get one thing straight first.

377
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,720
Is this your sixth personality?

378
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,320
Lightning or Thunderbolt?

379
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,480
I'm Sairung.

380
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,200
And why are you taking me out for noodles?

381
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,280
Don't be surprised or anything.

382
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,920
I just want to get to know you.

383
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,760
So we get to know each other better.

384
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,040
You never run out of surprises.

385
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,760
I like you so much.

386
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,000
I mean, I like you

387
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,280
as in I'm impressed.

388
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,720
Anyway, your wound's
fully healed now, right?

389
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,360
Yes.

390
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,840
Thank you for asking.

391
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,480
I want to thank you too for helping Storm.

392
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,480
Otherwise, she would've been
in serious danger.

393
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,960
Hey! Isn't Storm also you?

394
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,240
That's true.

395
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,040
What's that?
You don't seem like Sairung.

396
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,840
Are you not well?

397
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,960
I'm perfectly fine.

398
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,560
Hurry and eat before it gets cold.

399
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,360
- Eat up.
- Okay, okay.

400
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,000
We've still got a lot of places to go.

401
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,520
It was quick, but I woke up by myself.
The grief wasn't there…

402
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,680
- It's been days, right?
- It's here.

403
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,680
This?

404
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,760
Lady first.

405
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Hello. What can I get you, ma'am?

406
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,800
Can I have

407
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,480
one blueberry cake and a cold Earl Grey?

408
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,360
- Yes, sir.
- You?

409
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,040
We're in a coffee shop. Why not coffee?

410
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,320
If the coffee is not great,
I won't have it.

411
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,000
Simple logic.

412
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,960
How am I supposed to order coffee now?

413
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,280
One jasmine tea, please.

414
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,840
Don't you want some coffee?

415
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,480
I'm okay to have it, but like I said…

416
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,680
One black coffee, one toffee cake,
and an iced Espresso Champion, please.

417
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,720
Put it all on his bill.

418
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,480
Hi, Decha.

419
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,200
Hi, Sun, my bro.

420
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,240
Who's this? So pretty.

421
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,520
Is she your girlfriend?

422
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,520
Pretty, yes.

423
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,880
Girlfriend, not yet.

424
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,760
Ouch.

425
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,200
Why did you bring me here?

426
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,720
And why are we following these two?

427
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,120
Gudji, it's been a while.

428
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,360
Let's sit together.

429
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,760
Rung,

430
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,960
Sun just got out of the hospital.

431
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,960
Why are you dragging him around like this?

432
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,960
I'm okay.

433
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,960
This is nothing.

434
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,520
Your order's ready.

435
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,640
Thank you.

436
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,640
Come here.

437
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,760
- What's up?
- It's been a while since we talked.

438
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,960
So, are you out on a date
now that he's out of the hospital?

439
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,760
There's nothing much to it.

440
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,360
We're just grabbing a bite to eat
and some coffee, that's all.

441
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,480
You like him already, don't you?

442
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,080
Come on. Not yet.

443
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,360
Not yet.

444
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,600
I just…

445
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,320
It's not that yet.

446
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,520
But…

447
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But what?

448
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,280
Is there something I should know?

449
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,199
Nothing.

450
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,360
Then what's with the hesitation?

451
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,320
I'm just asking because I want to know
how you really feel about Sun.

452
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,719
Is everything all right?

453
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,800
Have you already fallen for Sun?

454
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,400
Sounds like you're trying
to warn me about something.

455
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,560
Why are you following us?
What's wrong?

456
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,080
Come on, bro.

457
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,960
If I don't follow you and you get stabbed,

458
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,560
who will take the hit for you,
Mr. Hero De Niro?

459
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,400
De Niro my ass.

460
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,720
I got stabbed because of you.

461
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,400
If you hadn't dodged,
I wouldn't have been.

462
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,240
Come on. I'm sorry.

463
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,920
It was just my reflex.

464
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,680
I honestly wanted to protect you,

465
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,360
but my body wasn't on the same page.

466
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
Just forget it.

467
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,840
Why's Gudji here?

468
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,960
If something goes wrong,
she won't be a burden, right?

469
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
Hold on.

470
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,640
De, my bro.

471
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,600
Yes?

472
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Do you have a crush on Gudji?

473
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,880
We ki…

474
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,640
We kis…

475
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,560
We kissed.

476
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,200
What the hell?
Can you not mumble for once?

477
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,320
- Gudji and I already kissed.
- Shit!

478
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,440
No shit.

479
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,600
You…

480
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,360
You and Gudji kissed?

481
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,920
Damn, damn, damn, damn you.

482
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,560
- No, damn you!
- Damn who?

483
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,640
That day felt like something
out of a movie.

484
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,280
Seriously, that moment,

485
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,360
if you had grabbed the brass knuckles!

486
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,520
You threw them away.

487
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,800
Not that, bro. I mean the other moment.

488
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,040
If you'd gotten hold of the knife baton
thing, that boxer dude…

489
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,400
You threw that to him as well.

490
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,840
I nearly got killed because of you.

491
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,240
Seriously, De.
Were you helping the attacker?

492
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,000
Well, well.

493
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,360
All right, all right.

494
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,080
What matters is you're all safe.

495
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,520
But next time, don't throw yourselves
in danger like that, okay?

496
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,360
Storm too.

497
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,120
And I already warned her.

498
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,400
Come on.

499
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,160
She's safe.

500
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,800
Let's split from them.

501
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,600
I still have a lot
I want to talk to you about.

502
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,320
Lead the way, Ms. Sairung.

503
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
We're off first, then.

504
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,400
- See you, bro.
- See you.

505
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,440
The cake here is good, sis.

506
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,640
Hey.

507
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,280
Is everything all right?

508
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,520
You seem a bit strange.

509
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,520
No, I'm okay.

510
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,760
Strange how?

511
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,320
After you talked with Gudji,
you seemed different.

512
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,360
What were you two talking about?

513
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,960
It went on for quite a while.

514
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,120
Have you already fallen for Sun?

515
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,800
Sounds like you're trying
to warn me about something.

516
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,280
Well, I'm worried about you, Rung.

517
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,040
Even though I know you're strong enough,

518
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,960
it might not be the case
for Marnmok, Fahsai, or the others.

519
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,720
They might not be able to understand
or deal with love.

520
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,640
Rung,

521
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,960
how sure are you about Sun?

522
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,000
What if I said…

523
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm confident in Sun?

524
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,960
I'm confident

525
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,320
that he's a good guy.

526
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,480
A good guy?

527
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,920
You're confident.

528
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,280
What about Marnmok?

529
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,040
And what about Fahsai,
Prai-Fon, and Storm?

530
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,440
Are they as confident about Sun
as you are?

531
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,840
Gudji.

532
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,800
If you've got something to say,
just say it.

533
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,120
I met up with him today

534
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,200
because I wanted to spend time with him
so that I can get to know him better.

535
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,560
So that I can be certain

536
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,800
that what Fahsai, Storm,
Prai-Fon, and Sai…

537
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,400
What those four believe is true.

538
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,920
Don't tell me…

539
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,760
You're not Sairung?

540
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,440
Marnmok!

541
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,760
Do you remember that night?

542
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,240
I told you I didn't, didn't I?

543
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,040
That night, I was wasted. Blackout.

544
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,160
I had a terrible hangover.

545
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,120
<i>It's as messy as what I'm saying, De.</i>

546
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,320
Why don't you just say
every girl's already fallen for you?

547
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,440
Only Marnmok's left.

548
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,560
What? Is that true?

549
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,400
Seems like it.

550
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,640
They're all the same person.

551
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,880
The ones who've been with you are all me.

552
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,640
Are you dating him?

553
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,600
He's a total asshole.

554
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,600
Nail and bail.

555
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,200
And you did that?

556
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,120
What the hell is this?

557
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,800
What exactly are you doing?
