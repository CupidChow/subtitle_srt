1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,120
<i>This is probably one of</i>
<i>the first times in years</i>

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
<i>that my heart's actually</i>
<i>raced for someone.</i>

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,680
<i>People who don't know us might think</i>
<i>you just confessed your love to me.</i>

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,840
<i>Confessed my love?</i>

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
But maybe someday.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,760
Who knows?

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,120
Didn't you want to see me again?

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,080
The person you met wasn't me.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,320
Stop making things up.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,440
I want you to flirt with my daughter.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,920
I have just one daughter,

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,560
but she has…

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
five personalities.

14
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,120
Anyway,

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,640
if I come across a doctor or someone
who can actually help you,

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,040
I'll let you know.

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,440
But for now, I have to go.

18
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,680
<i>He knows exactly what I like.</i>

19
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,640
<i>The type I'm weak for.</i>

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
<i>Feels like he was made to be</i>
<i>my perfect match.</i>

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,840
<i>Makes me fall in just a few days.</i>

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,760
<i>And in the end,</i>
<i>I fell right into his trap.</i>

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,199
This is not a request,

24
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,480
but an order.

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,240
He snaps his fingers like Thanos.

26
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,880
That's the love karma!

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,800
It makes you do any…

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey!

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Anything.

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,520
Damn it!

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,240
And you said yes?

32
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Seriously, bro, are you really that dumb?

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,960
Calling me dumb? You might as well
drop the whole big bro respect shit.

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,440
Bro, are you that dumb?

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
Come on, De.

36
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,400
Did you seriously believe that?

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,880
That whole mysterious, complex condition,
does it even exist, Sun?

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,920
It's called
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
Doesn't it only exist in movies?

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,520
But from what I've seen of Sairung,

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,200
she does seem to have
multiple personalities.

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay, let's say this condition does exist.

43
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,120
Is you flirting with her

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,920
seriously going to cure it?

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,920
I don't know yet.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,800
But here's what I do know.

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,200
If you and I turn this job down,

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,760
our business is screwed.

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Or worse,

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,960
we could be rotting in jail together
for years.

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,040
Shit.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,080
So, you have to flirt with five girls.

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,320
Yes.

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,400
Don't you think it's weird,

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,200
going after girls who all look the same?

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,280
But don't forget.

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,080
Even if they all look alike,
they have different personalities.

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,800
They're basically different girls.

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,960
So it's like five times the work.

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,480
Yes. That's why the pay
is five times higher.

61
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,400
500K?

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,280
He already paid some in advance.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,480
Well then, I'll do whatever you say.

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
There's no other option.

65
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
If you abandon me again,

66
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,280
I'll be the one dragging you to hell.

67
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,640
These are the five girls
you have to flirt with?

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,560
Yes.

69
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,640
These are the five girls that we must do
whatever it takes to make fall for me.

70
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,640
Bro, should we leave now?
There's still time to change our minds.

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,240
No, there isn't.

72
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,480
This is De, a junior of mine.

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,360
He's the one I said would help me out.

74
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,160
Nice to meet you, Mr. Theppachai.

75
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,640
Take out your ID card and follow me.

76
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,600
What do you need it for?

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Not for an election, duh!

78
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,120
It's for your employee contract.

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,720
I've already prepared the paperwork.
I'll bring it here for you to sign.

80
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Okay.

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,760
Thank you.

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,480
Based on my research, all five girls
have separate social media accounts.

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,480
Fahsai is the real fangirl.

84
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,040
She's into anime, idols, music…

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,560
She even shares posts from pre-order shops
to win free tumblers.

86
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,520
She's always in colorful outfits.

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
She'll probably be the easiest one
to get close to.

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,280
You just need the right approach.

89
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,640
DAY 1
FAHSAI

90
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,400
You like MARS too?

91
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
Yes! You're a MARS fan too?

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,520
Let me guess.

93
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,080
Your bias is Jun?

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,240
Whoa! How did you know?

95
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,760
People always think my bias is Nano.

96
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,000
Look at this.

97
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,160
At this recent event,
Jun was really handsome.

98
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,960
How are we supposed to know
when her personality switches?

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,400
What are their shift times?

100
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,880
According to Mr. Theppachai,
her personality shifts every day.

101
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,680
If it's Fahsai on Monday,
it'll be the other girls the next day.

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,680
Five days, five personalities.
It's like a movie.

103
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,960
If it's an easy one that day,
it'll be no sweat.

104
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,840
But if it's a tough one,
it'll be a nightmare.

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,400
Like this one in the sweatsuit.

106
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,360
She'll be the hardest, I'd say.

107
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,840
Seriously, Sun. What's the rush?

108
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,280
Can't you see?
There's no freakin' handrail. It's scary.

109
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,760
Let me go first then.

110
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,200
- No! Don't squeeze past me!
- Sun.

111
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,720
Let me go first. Bro!

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,600
DAY 2
STORM

113
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,640
If you're going to play around like this,

114
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,760
go play at home.

115
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,320
Oops.

116
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,440
Sorry. That didn't hurt too bad, right?

117
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,960
But you!

118
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,160
Nice reflexes.

119
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,800
Wanna meet me at the gym sometimes?

120
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,640
Sor… sorry.
That didn't hurt too bad, right?

121
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,400
- Come on, hurry!
- You!

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,640
This is Prai-Fon.
She's a walking encyclopedia of this era.

123
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,760
She knows everything.

124
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,360
Every single detail
about everything on this planet.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,120
Is that so?

126
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,280
Take a look at this.

127
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,040
LIME: VEGETABLE OR FRUIT?

128
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,080
THE TERM FRUIT, IN GENERAL USAGE…

129
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,520
She never gives simple answers.
She explains even when no one asked.

130
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,320
If you walk up to her dumb,
you'll walk away educated.

131
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,160
- You're not gonna be dumb, right?
- Someone like me?

132
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,560
DAY 3
PRAI-FON

133
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,400
Is that book good?

134
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,200
I'm thinking of buying it.

135
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,680
It's quite good. They analyze Columbus'
thoughts before he started his voyage.

136
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,000
Whoa. He's my favorite American, you know.

137
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,000
Columbus was Italian.

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,960
Ouch!

139
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,840
Why not just slam the brakes on so I crack
my skull open and die while you're at it?

140
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,440
The brake pedal on this car is shallow.

141
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,800
I stepped on it normally.

142
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,920
You hit the headrest yourself.
Why are you blaming me?

143
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,040
Your driving sucks.
Can't you just admit it?

144
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,840
Or do you actually want me dead?

145
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,880
Trying to get rid of the one person
who knows about your scam squad, huh?

146
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,120
Seriously, sis.
You're taking this way too far.

147
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,799
I'm driving just fine.

148
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,480
You can't control your own neck,
and somehow it's my fault?

149
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,840
How dare you talk back to me?!

150
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,240
Just get out of the car already.

151
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,160
Aren't you tired from working all day?
Go get the rest you clearly need.

152
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,320
Sun, next time we go out
to meet sources, you drive.

153
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm not doing it anymore.
She's seriously too much.

154
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,240
I missed one U-turn and she yelled at me
like I'd run someone over.

155
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,280
She must be really mad at both of us.

156
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,120
And here we are, paying for our sins.

157
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,200
Are you two gonna keep chatting
till tomorrow?!

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,400
Come help me unload this stuff already!

159
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,600
Hey, Sun.

160
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,520
Are we gonna just be pretending
to work at this news agency?

161
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,160
When we're out in the field
like we were today,

162
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,960
we can't be with our target.

163
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,160
That will mean we have to wait
until next week

164
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,640
to meet all five personalities.

165
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,000
I guess so.

166
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,160
I have no clue
who appears each day either.

167
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,320
Honestly, just meeting three of them
has already been exhausting.

168
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,080
If we meet all five,
are we even gonna make it?

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
My ride's here.

170
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm off. See you.

171
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
See you.

172
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,960
DAY 4
SAIRUNG

173
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,120
Sairung.

174
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,760
So the new staff member is you.

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
When we're passionate about something,

176
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,800
it has a way of bringing us together.

177
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,240
Why aren't you going home yet?

178
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
I just got back from meeting
our sources with Gudji.

179
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,120
We only finished unloading a minute ago.

180
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,080
How many days have you been working here?

181
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,560
Four days.

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,440
Do you like it here?

183
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,000
I do.

184
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,280
Which day have you liked the most so far?

185
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,640
Day four.

186
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,680
Would you like to grab a drink with me?

187
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,400
I'll give you a ride back.

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,520
Maybe next time.

189
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,400
I'm already worn out today.

190
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,880
Next time… when?

191
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,560
After the rain.

192
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,120
LIKE MEDUSA, ACCIDENTALLY LOCKING EYES
WITH HER COULD TURN YOU TO STONE.

193
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,640
Coffee, sir.

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,400
Whoa, Sun. You didn't style your hair.

195
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,200
And you put on way too much perfume.

196
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,720
You definitely got up late today.

197
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,040
Could it be that
you went to bed late last night?

198
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,720
And?

199
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,600
I saw you've already updated
our shared file on the five personalities.

200
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,520
So, which one's Medusa?

201
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,520
You must like that one.

202
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,640
Stop talking nonsense.

203
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,480
Don't tell me you stayed up late
thinking about her.

204
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,600
Come on, Sun. Don't be such a noob.

205
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,600
You're supposed to make them fall for you,
not the other way around.

206
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,480
Can you stop picking on me?

207
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,320
After you left, I ran into Sairung,

208
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,760
so I updated her part last night.

209
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,760
I just typed it real quick.
I didn't know how to describe her.

210
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,440
That means we're meeting
the last personality today.

211
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,040
Five days, five personalities, all met.

212
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,560
What's the name of the last one?

213
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,480
Pamarn?

214
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,960
Marnfah? Marnok? Marnjai?

215
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,360
Fahpha? Fahrong? Marnrood?

216
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,040
None of those.

217
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,240
<i>Chin up, shoulders squared,</i>
<i>arms folded low.</i>

218
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,360
<i>Walled up, but fully focused</i>
<i>and deeply determined.</i>

219
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,480
Marnmok.

220
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,400
Yes.

221
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,320
My name is Marnmok.

222
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,760
DAY 5
MARNMOK

223
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,120
Sun.

224
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,400
I snooped through her socials.

225
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,200
Marnmok's the type who
keeps her walls high.

226
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
She's got one hell of
a self-defense system.

227
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,040
She always has something to say about
everything, like a rant machine.

228
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Yeah, she does seem like that.

229
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,280
Out of all five,

230
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,240
Marnmok seems like
the hardest one to approach.

231
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,000
You've gotta break through
her walls somehow.

232
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,080
Think of her as the final boss.

233
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,160
Let's see who's got the most power.

234
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,280
Hey.

235
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,320
Can't you say something before popping up
like that? You startled me.

236
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,560
Didn't you get startled
because of my voice?

237
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,400
Still good at talking back, I see.

238
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,880
So you do remember me.

239
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,200
My name is Sun.

240
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,960
I'm your new employee.

241
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Thanks for the intro,

242
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,040
but I read the office updates every day.

243
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,600
Now that we know each other,
get back to work.

244
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,400
There's no need for much interaction.

245
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,960
How could there not be?

246
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,680
We're co-workers, aren't we?

247
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,560
You do know, don't you?

248
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,120
I have a condition.
I'm not like other people.

249
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,320
If by "condition," you mean you and…

250
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,640
the other four,

251
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,440
yeah, I know.

252
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,160
And that won't be a problem
for you working here?

253
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,200
I've already made friends
with the other four.

254
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
Now,

255
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
it's just you.

256
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,960
Just focus on your work.

257
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
You don't have to try to get to know me.

258
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,200
I don't have to try at all.

259
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,200
The way you look at me with your chin up?

260
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,320
You do that to intimidate me.
To make yourself feel superior.

261
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,160
But at the same time,

262
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,560
you're folding your arms tight,
like you're protecting yourself

263
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
because you don't trust me.

264
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,320
And the fact that you could throw coffee
at someone who simply greeted you

265
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,280
just shows how guarded you always are.

266
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,400
And you…

267
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,160
you probably came to work here
with some personal agenda,

268
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,400
not just for the job.

269
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,080
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
this good at reading people.

270
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,400
Being good at reading people

271
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,400
is actually good for this job, isn't it?

272
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
Then get ready.

273
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,320
We're heading out into the field
in 20 minutes.

274
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,080
Show me how good you really are
at working.

275
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,320
Your bro is really something.

276
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,040
Usually, Marnmok
doesn't talk to anyone that easily.

277
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Decha.

278
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,800
Amazing.

279
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,520
Sun will always find a way.

280
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
- Anyway, Boss Thep…
- Yes?

281
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,319
My name is De, from Debut.

282
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,079
Where did you get Decha from?

283
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,079
Come on…

284
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,920
De…

285
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,040
Cha.

286
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,680
Deal with it.

287
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,400
Sun…

288
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,280
"Day." Perfect!

289
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,280
You got a friend named "Mon" too?
Then we'd have Mon "Day."

290
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,600
He enjoys making names up, huh?

291
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,400
Got it.

292
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,680
From Truth Today.

293
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,440
Hey, Marnmok.

294
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,440
Which floor are we going to?

295
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,080
The 29th floor. Why?

296
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
No reason.

297
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,400
Are you okay?

298
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,760
Can you still work?

299
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,320
I'm okay.

300
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,440
Are you okay?

301
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,160
I…

302
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,840
I tend to get nervous when meeting people,

303
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
especially someone like him.

304
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,120
Keep doing that.

305
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,280
Whenever you feel insecure,
just fold your arms like that.

306
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
It's a gift for my new colleague.

307
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,800
I hope we can work well together.

308
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,800
Would you like some coffee?
I'll have my secretary prepare it for you.

309
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,520
No, we're good.

310
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,840
Thank you.

311
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,040
Shall we begin the interview?

312
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,160
We don't want to take up
too much of your time.

313
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,200
Don't worry, it's no trouble at all.

314
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,800
We'd like to ask about
your "Single House" project.

315
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,400
We've heard Kritsana Real Estate is
currently developing this project

316
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,200
This project actually started from
my own experience raising my kids.

317
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,560
That's why "Single House" was designed

318
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,720
as a housing development that directly
meets the needs of modern parents.

319
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,600
The project includes a full range
of facilities to support that lifestyle.

320
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,960
Let me ask specifically about a topic
that's been a recurring issue

321
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,800
over the past few years.

322
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,240
About the claims that Kritsana Real Estate

323
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,160
often acquires land for development

324
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,800
in ways that aren't exactly by the book.

325
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,920
What do you mean?

326
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,320
Coercion.

327
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,280
Backdoor influences.

328
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,800
For example,
the slum eviction case involving arson.

329
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,680
That incident led to fatalities,

330
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,520
both directly and indirectly.

331
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,800
Some made the news.

332
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,880
Others did not.

333
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,960
This topic

334
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,040
wasn't sent for approval
beforehand, was it?

335
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,160
Well, it's a follow-up question.

336
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,160
I've been in this business
for a long time.

337
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,520
Everything can be legally inspected.

338
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,120
But the claims used to discredit me
that you mentioned,

339
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,280
I've never seen any verifiable evidence
to support them.

340
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,840
Could that be due to
the backdoor influences

341
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,960
which I mentioned earlier?

342
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,160
That's why nothing can be scrutinized.

343
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,360
I have a theory worth mentioning.

344
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,560
One about a new no-name news agency

345
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,520
that's desperate for views and engagement.

346
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,560
They provoke a real estate entrepreneur,
hoping to catch footage of him losing it.

347
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,320
What do you think of this theory?

348
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,440
Are you accusing me?

349
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,760
Are you accusing me?

350
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,320
Every accusation made against me,

351
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I've proven my innocence
through the justice system.

352
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,640
There's no need to reopen old wounds
for the benefit of others.

353
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,080
That's all the time Mr. Kritsana has
for the interview.

354
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,400
I have another meeting.

355
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
Please excuse me.

356
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,920
Pack up the camera. We need to go now.

357
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,440
Are you crazy?

358
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,600
You're telling me
the interview footage is gone?

359
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,600
The camera overheated and shut down,

360
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,880
so the last part of the file got deleted.

361
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,800
I'm sorry.

362
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
All you had to do was press record.

363
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,480
You couldn't even manage that?

364
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,320
Hey, I didn't mean for this to happen.
It was an accident.

365
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,840
I apologized, didn't I?

366
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,680
Can your apology bring the footage back?

367
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,440
Hey, lady.

368
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,640
Is it really losing the footage you're
upset about, or losing to him?

369
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,840
Hey!

370
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,120
That's Marnmok. Always gloomy and cloudy.

371
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
You better get used to that.

372
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,840
Yes, bro.

373
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,400
Don't bother trying to win against her.
Her ego's as high as Everest.

374
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,360
Seriously, bro.

375
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,600
You've handled all kinds of uphill tasks,

376
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,200
but you tripped at an overheated camera
and lost the footage?

377
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,800
What got into you?

378
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,480
Even my fourth-grade nephew
knows how to record a TikTok video.

379
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,320
I need your help,

380
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,880
not salt in the wound.

381
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,000
Right now, just help me recover the file.

382
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,520
How am I supposed to do that?

383
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,280
If the file had just been corrupted,
maybe I could recover it.

384
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,240
But this?

385
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,240
There's nothing recorded.
What do you want me to bring back?

386
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,920
What should I do?

387
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,960
Didn't you say

388
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,800
they were just arguing about
whether or not he did the wrong thing?

389
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,360
There's not much else to it, right?

390
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
I don't know.

391
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
But…

392
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,160
the interview today
seemed important to Marnmok.

393
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,960
He seems like he's
connected to her somehow.

394
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,760
Yeesh.

395
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,880
- Sun.
- Yes?

396
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,480
Did you use the recording pen I gave you?

397
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,760
It's showing as online.

398
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,360
<i>Every accusation made against me,</i>

399
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,720
<i>I've proven my innocence</i>
<i>through the justice system.</i>

400
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,280
I've got a way out!

401
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,880
Okay.

402
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,920
Mom,

403
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,960
I met that man today.

404
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,080
Hey!

405
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,320
Wake up.

406
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,240
Yeah!

407
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,920
Yes, we're home.

408
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,320
Why do you always take me out?

409
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,480
Are you fighting with Mom again?

410
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,760
What makes you think that?

411
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,400
Because every time
you two yell at each other,

412
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,560
you end up taking me somewhere.

413
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,920
Here's the deal.

414
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,280
I promise that
Mom and I won't fight anymore.

415
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,280
Promise?

416
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,280
Promise. Now go.

417
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,320
Let's go in.

418
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,120
No running!

419
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,600
Watch your step.

420
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,400
Dad, something's wrong with Mom!

421
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Porn!

422
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,640
Honey.

423
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,800
Honey!

424
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,640
Honey.

425
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,680
I've got an injured person here.
It's an emergency.

426
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,000
Please hurry!

427
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,200
I don't know. I don't know. Please hurry!

428
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,240
I don't know what happened to her.

429
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,960
<i>Every accusation made against me,</i>

430
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,200
<i>I've proven my innocence</i>
<i>through the justice system.</i>

431
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,160
<i>There's no need to reopen old wounds</i>
<i>for the benefit of others.</i>

432
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,840
We've got everything from start to finish.

433
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,960
Your pen is amazing.

434
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,160
Smart is your thing, sure.

435
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,640
But here, I'm the genius.

436
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,640
What does this guy Kritsana
have to do with our task, though?

437
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,440
I don't know.

438
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,080
Let's just save this audio file for now.

439
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,760
Sure.

440
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,080
Useless.

441
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,800
<i>What kind of cameraman</i>
<i>can't even tell the camera's overheating?</i>

442
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,680
That's real-time voice recording, right?

443
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,080
Yeah.

444
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,920
Marnmok must have taken the pen home.

445
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,640
And she has some harsh things
to say about you.

446
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,200
I warned you, didn't I?

447
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,800
Don't be dumb. Seriously, don't.

448
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,960
Hey, it's almost midnight.

449
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,280
I gotta bounce.
Got a football match to catch.

450
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,520
- All right, see you.
- See you.

451
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,040
<i>But the truth is,</i>

452
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,000
<i>you can't really move forward</i>

453
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,800
<i>if you don't understand</i>
<i>what made you who you are today.</i>

454
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,000
<i>And one thing you absolutely have to do</i>
<i>is stop being afraid to face your past.</i>

455
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,320
<i>Otherwise, you'll keep losing to it</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

456
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,920
It's not that easy to do.

457
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,040
<i>The fear we have of the past</i>
<i>can take away our chance to learn from it.</i>

458
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,200
<i>And if we keep running from it,</i>

459
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,760
<i>we'll never grow into something better.</i>

460
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,080
<i>The past never really goes anywhere.</i>

461
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,120
<i>It will always stay with us.</i>

462
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,280
<i>But what matters most</i>
<i>is accepting and learning from it.</i>

463
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,600
<i>We have to stop running</i>
<i>and find the courage to look ahead,</i>

464
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,160
<i>with the past as a part of who we are.</i>

465
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,680
<i>Marnmok's listening to heavy stuff again.</i>

466
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,680
<i>How boring.</i>

467
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,360
That's Fahsai's voice.

468
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,200
<i>Wow, Jun looks so handsome here.</i>

469
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,000
<i>Gonna swoon over this with Sun tomorrow.</i>

470
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,800
Does she switch her personality
at midnight?

471
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,760
Do you have something urgent to do?
Why are you here so early?

472
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,720
My urgent task is you, Fahsai.

473
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,840
Wanna grab some sweets?

474
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,640
We can talk about
all the stuff we're into.

475
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,040
The band debuted 148 days ago.

476
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,920
I've been a Sphere for 147 days.

477
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,880
MARS' FANDOM NAME

478
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,400
Why weren't you one from day 1?

479
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I wanted you to be the one
who liked MARS first.

480
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,080
Can I ask something serious?

481
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,280
Are you…

482
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,680
shipping anyone in the band?

483
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,560
Thame. Jun. Nano. Dylan. Pepper.

484
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,960
Thame. Jun.

485
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,000
Nano. Dylan. Pepper.

486
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,680
They've got chemistry no matter
who they're paired with.

487
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,640
Whatever they're selling,
I'm buying it all.

488
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,000
That's nice of you!

489
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,320
I don't want the members
to feel pressured by this thing.

490
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,160
I'm really glad I can talk to someone
who's into the same things as me.

491
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,400
Honestly, yesterday's atmosphere

492
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,520
felt completely different.

493
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,520
I couldn't talk to Marnmok and feel
as comfortable as I do with you.

494
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,800
Don't say that.

495
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
Marnmok might feel hurt.

496
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,080
Wait, can she hear this?

497
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,080
No.

498
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,960
Does she know what
we're talking about right now?

499
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
No, she doesn't.

500
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,000
Okay.

501
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,600
Hey…

502
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,719
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

503
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,000
These names,

504
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,760
Sairung, Marnmok,
Fahsai, Prai-Fon, and Storm.

505
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,760
Who came up with them?

506
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,600
They're the names we use for each other
based on our moods and personalities.

507
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,840
Sairung means rainbow in the sky, right?

508
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,800
So our names are like
moods in the sky too.

509
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,120
I see.

510
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,320
Prai-Fon.

511
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,480
Marnmok.

512
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,719
Sairung.

513
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,920
Fahsai…

514
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,320
Those all make sense.

515
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,640
But Storm… kinda sounds like
a Marvel superhero.

516
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,880
Come on.

517
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,600
She's the tough one.

518
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,400
Doesn't Storm suit her perfectly?

519
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,680
I get it.

520
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,480
So…

521
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,960
where are the other girls now?

522
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,360
They're in their personal spaces.

523
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,320
Personal spaces?

524
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,960
We each have our own personal spaces.

525
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,520
<i>Our personal space is like</i>

526
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,160
<i>a room in our mind,</i>

527
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,000
<i>and each of us has our own corner.</i>

528
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,840
<i>Being in the light</i>
<i>means coming out to live.</i>

529
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,880
<i>The five of us take turns</i>
<i>spending time in the light each day.</i>

530
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,720
Monday to Friday, it's one per day.

531
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,080
Do the weekends go by quota or something?

532
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,360
Weekends are special. One of us gets to
be in the light for two days straight.

533
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,600
The turn goes in a loop.

534
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,240
Whoever takes the weekend has to wait
until everyone else has had their turn

535
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,880
before coming out in the light again.

536
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,800
Whoa.

537
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,080
Sounds like a movie, just like De said.

538
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
But…

539
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,040
why the rules?

540
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,000
Who came up with them?

541
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,560
It didn't used to be this strict.

542
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,840
In the past, we were all together.

543
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Any of us could come out
and spend time in the light.

544
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,760
We didn't have
personal spaces or anything.

545
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,040
But…

546
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,000
Sairung, why can't you understand?

547
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,400
This is my life. It's my right.

548
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,600
- What does it have to do with you?
- Just be in your right mind for once…

549
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,440
<i>Sairung and Marnmok had a huge fight.</i>
<i>They decided to live separately.</i>

550
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,800
<i>No one needed to know</i>
<i>how the others lived their lives</i>

551
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,200
<i>as long as they didn't do anything risky.</i>

552
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,360
<i>When something important came up,</i>
<i>we'd just meet and talk face-to-face.</i>

553
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,320
<i>You have no sense of responsibility!</i>

554
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,480
And our conversation right now?

555
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,920
The other four don't know about it

556
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,880
because they don't care to know.

557
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,760
What did Sairung and Marnmok fight about?

558
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,640
It's personal.
I don't think it's my place to tell you.

559
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,520
If you really want to know,

560
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,280
you should ask them yourself.

561
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,120
But you can only do that
when you're close enough with them.

562
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,160
What about us?

563
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,040
Are we close yet?

564
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,080
I like the same boy band as you do.

565
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,920
It feels like
seeing a younger version of myself.

566
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,680
Like this toy

567
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,280
that I feel like is my close friend.

568
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,640
I always play with it when I'm lonely.

569
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,880
That's MARS merch! Rubik Series 1!
It's super rare! How'd you get it?

570
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,760
MARS RUBIK SERIES 1

571
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,840
TOOK FOREVER TO GET MY HANDS ON THIS.
LET ME FLEX A BIT.

572
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,280
My little bro's seriously sick.
Final-stage critical.

573
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,880
This might be the only thing

574
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,400
that can cheer him up
with the little time he has left.

575
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
- Liar.
- How much?

576
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,720
I told you I've been a Sphere
for 147 days.

577
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,280
One day less than you.

578
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,120
So I think

579
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,520
this should go to someone
who deserves it more than me.

580
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,960
Are you hoping for something here?

581
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,040
What would I be hoping for?

582
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,680
I just want us to be close.

583
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,600
Even if you give it to me,
I don't know how to solve it.

584
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,640
It might seem complicated at first,

585
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,760
but once you understand how it works,
you'll start to get the hang of it.

586
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,120
First, you need to find the daisy.

587
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,840
Daisy, right?

588
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,960
Turn the white pieces
to be around the yellow center.

589
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,240
Okay! We're close now.

590
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,560
What's gotten into you this time?

591
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,040
I think Fahsai is kinda cute too.

592
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,200
Actually, she's just like any other girl.

593
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,840
Multiple sides. Multiple emotions.

594
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,320
But in her case, it is a bit different.

595
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,600
Each personality takes turns
coming out each day.

596
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,960
Wow.

597
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,520
You're like a chameleon changing colors.

598
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,240
You can match whoever you're with.

599
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,040
I'm impressed… and a little scared.

600
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,320
So I guess this task's
a walk in the park, huh?

601
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,680
Easy as pie.

602
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,280
Easy my foot.

603
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,640
I just found out they've got an issue.

604
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,040
A big one, actually.

605
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,120
Sairung and Marnmok are at odds.

606
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,640
What?

607
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,560
They're fighting?

608
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,640
I thought if I could
make all of them fall for me,

609
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,560
Sairung might become whole again.

610
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,760
But with two out of the five
not getting along like this,

611
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,320
you think they'll cooperate with me?

612
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,280
I doubt it.

613
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,440
We've gotta fix their issue too?

614
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,640
And this is what I'm assigning you.

615
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,080
Tomorrow, you'll be with Prai-Fon.

616
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,360
What?!

617
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,000
You want me to flirt with Prai-Fon?

618
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,000
This plan of yours is not gonna work.

619
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,480
Not flirting.

620
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,680
I need you out in the field
gathering info.

621
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,680
You really think I can fix things
with all five of them at once?

622
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,040
- If so, why the hell would I need you?
- Chill, bro.

623
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,680
For my 30% cut,
I'd even be willing to die for it.

624
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,360
Where I need to go, what I need to do,
just say the word.

625
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,200
But can I actually pull this off?

626
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,560
Following someone, or stalking,

627
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,240
is the act of following or monitoring
someone over a period of time.

628
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,920
It's considered illegal behavior.

629
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,240
Will you be okay

630
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,280
if I want you in the ring with me?

631
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,080
She's really an Avenger.

632
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,600
<i>Sairung is a bit difficult to work with.</i>
<i>Can he really handle it?</i>

633
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,640
You used to be close to her
for a while, right?

634
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,480
Not gonna give him any advice?

635
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,960
I heard Sairung keep mumbling
that she's drunk.

636
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,600
I don't know what's going on with her.
