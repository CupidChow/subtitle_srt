1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,320
I wanted to get your thoughts
on something.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,120
If Sun got in here and isn't doing
his job like everyone else,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,520
but has some kind of agenda

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,440
won't that risk messing up the work too?

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,200
I can sense that Sun is approaching her
with a hidden agenda.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,520
And I can sense that you've got
some strange intentions here too.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,720
I want to take you to study outside.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,080
You've been with me for hours.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,280
I haven't seen a single text or call.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,440
You've gotta be single, right?

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
What about you?
Don't you want to be with anyone?

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,200
I want someone who understands me.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,320
Can I try too?

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll fly with you.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,040
REAL ESTATE TYCOON
DENIES ALL ALLEGATIONS

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,040
What are you guys doing exactly?

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,560
I'm going to check on Storm.
Something feels off.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,040
You gather this info.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,000
- I'll be back soon.
- Got it, bro.

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,200
Good.

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
Before you became a boxing coach,
what did you do?

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,440
You're not really here to practice boxing.

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,480
You're getting involved
with a real estate tycoon like Kritsana.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,320
- Aren't you worried about Storm's safety?
- Storm is not alone in this.

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,320
I'll help her.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,400
If what I believe is true,

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,800
I might be able to overcome
this dissociative identity disorder.

28
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,520
Hello.

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,920
Where's your mind drifting now?

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
What's wrong? Thinking of your girlfriend?

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,440
No. I don't have a girlfriend.

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,760
I know. If you did, you wouldn't be here.

33
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,680
You girls are smart, all five of you.

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,080
Who's the smartest?

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,600
If all five of you teamed up, I can't
imagine how much of a genius you'd be.

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
That's scary.

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,520
Who's the smartest?

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,440
Answer.

39
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,520
Prai-Fon.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,480
She's like a walking encyclopedia.

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,600
It's gotta be her, right?

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,680
Then who's the prettiest?

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
Sairung, right?

44
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,800
All five of you have the same face.

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,960
That's a weird question.

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,000
That's true.

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,520
And…

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,440
who's the cutest?

49
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,840
If we're talking "cute"
the way most people see it,

50
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
it's definitely you.

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,640
But in my view,

52
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,160
I think

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,360
you all are cute.

54
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,880
Come on.

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,640
You played it safe with that answer.

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,120
Hey, why the sulking?

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,800
Me flattering you
means I'm flattering all five of you.

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,240
Fine, fine.

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,920
I was just sulking for fun.

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,120
- Let me ask you back.
- Okie!

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,160
What kind of guy does each of you like?

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,560
Whoa.

63
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,080
That question is kinda tacky.

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,120
Tacky?

65
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,600
- Ask again.
- Fine, let me change my question.

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,800
What kind of guy
does each of you like to be with?

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,600
How could I answer for the other four?

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
You'll have to ask them yourself, okay?

69
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,440
I'll ask just you then, Fahsai.

70
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,800
Yes?

71
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,960
What kind of guy
do you like being around, Fahsai?

72
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,480
A warm guy.

73
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait up.

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,560
- Come on.
- Fahsai!

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,760
What? Just follow me.

76
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,760
What's the rush?

77
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,360
- Sun, hurry up and follow me.
- Wait.

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
Hey!

79
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,800
What are you playing at?

80
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
What was that for?
Look at the mess you're making.

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,120
It's just water. You'll dry off soon.

82
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,360
It's just water.

83
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,680
You'll dry off soon.

84
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,640
Does that make you feel warm?

85
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,760
It's pretty warm.

86
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,480
This made me… think of Mom.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
Sun!

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,320
I want you to join me for one more thing.

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,960
Mom told me to come here
whenever I feel bad.

90
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,360
It'd make me feel better.

91
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,800
So true.

92
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,080
Anyway,

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
you zoned out earlier.

94
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,040
Do you feel better now?

95
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,520
Well, yeah.

96
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,160
But there's something
I'm still wondering about.

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,720
It's like right now,

98
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,320
Marnmok, Sairung, Prai-Fon, and Storm

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,720
are digging into something.

100
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,960
And it seems a little strange

101
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,360
and kind of dangerous.

102
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Into what?

103
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,360
Your mom's death.

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,600
Storm mentioned some truth.

105
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,360
Do you happen to know

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,360
what the truth is that she mentioned?

107
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
And the real estate tycoon named Kritsana…

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,680
What does he have to do with all this?

109
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,200
And there's that eviction fire from
19 years ago that Prai-Fon's looking into.

110
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,440
Marnmok's also trying
to confront Kritsana.

111
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,920
And Storm's been acting strange
around that boxing coach.

112
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,880
What does all of this have to do with
your mom's suicide?

113
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,160
Mom didn't kill herself.

114
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,800
Mom didn't kill herself.

115
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,560
She didn't do it.

116
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
She was stronger than that.

117
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
She didn't kill herself.

118
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,840
- Fahsai. Fahsai?
- She didn't. Mom wasn't a coward.

119
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,880
- Calm down.
- She wasn't. She was stronger than that.

120
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,640
- Fahsai, calm down.
- She'd never do such a thing. She didn't.

121
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,480
- Fahsai. Fahsai.
- Mom wasn't a coward. The others were.

122
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
Mom didn't do it. She didn't kill herself.

123
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,120
Then who did, Fahsai?

124
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,680
- Mom didn't kill herself. She didn't.
- Who did?

125
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,720
Calm down.

126
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,560
- Fahsai!
- Mom didn't kill herself!

127
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
Fahsai, calm down.

128
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,280
Fahsai.

129
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,400
This matter doesn't concern you.

130
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,160
Marnmok?

131
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
How did you get out here?

132
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,000
It's not your turn.

133
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,440
Don't do this to Fahsai.

134
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,320
It isn't your business.

135
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,880
You're messing everything up.

136
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I don't know

137
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,640
what you are fighting about,
or what you're trying to find.

138
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,159
It's not like I want to poke my nose
into your business.

139
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,919
But if you hear me out,

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,919
what I saw while I was with Sairung
and Storm might actually help--

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,280
Stop talking about things that
don't concern you already!

142
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,440
It's you. You're the one
causing trouble for all of us.

143
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,440
You're the ones turning on each other.

144
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
You don't know us that well.

145
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,840
Don't try to teach us.

146
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,040
Open up, Marnmok.
Open up like the other four did.

147
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,040
No!

148
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,160
And as for you,

149
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,800
stay out of this.

150
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,920
Understood?

151
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
Marnmok, you're breaking our rules.

152
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,440
Can't you see what Fahsai's going through?

153
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
Aren't you gonna help her?

154
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,600
No matter what we're facing,
we're all grown-ups.

155
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,200
We should find our own way through it.

156
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,560
Can't you see how Fahsai is right now?

157
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,600
But this isn't the first time
Fahsai's been like this.

158
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,320
It's a condition caused by trauma,
or a psychological disorder.

159
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,440
One way for her to heal
is to face it on her own.

160
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,920
Get your head out of your books.

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,560
Try living in the real world for once!

162
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,200
Fahsai will grow stronger
if she learns to fight.

163
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,160
Taking someone else's time in the light
only makes things worse like before.

164
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,520
Let Fahsai fight through
the pain for once.

165
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,040
Fahsai, who represents our younger selves,

166
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,240
might finally get through the pain.

167
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,200
Protecting Fahsai

168
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,720
is no different
than protecting all five of us.

169
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,720
If Fahsai breaks or hurts,

170
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,040
we all hurt the same.

171
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
I am you,

172
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,400
and you are me in this body.

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,320
So I don't think what I'm doing
is unreasonable or anything.

174
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,120
Stop blaming each other.

175
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,360
Just help protect us from anything bad.

176
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,200
A knock would've been nice!

177
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,640
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

178
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,760
So urgent you couldn't knock first?

179
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,200
It relates to your daughter.

180
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,680
Your family, your wife, and you

181
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,720
have some history with
Kritsana Real Estate, don't you?

182
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,840
Take a seat.

183
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,000
This'll be a long conversation.

184
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,560
You hired me to go after your daughter.

185
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,880
But instead, I found her

186
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,080
digging into Kritsana Real Estate.

187
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,520
I don't know what this is all about,

188
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,800
but I know you're hiding
something from me.

189
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,800
Sir.

190
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,880
If you're feeding me fake info like this.

191
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,400
I can't finish the job.

192
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,640
I've checked the timelines.

193
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,200
It happened around the same time
your wife passed away.

194
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,760
These two things were related, right?

195
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,840
I don't want to talk about it.

196
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,680
So I have to dig into it myself?

197
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,480
Hi, Gudji. Is it urgent?

198
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm talking with Sun right now.

199
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,960
I can call back later.

200
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,360
But listen, if Sun asks you something,
just tell him.

201
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,840
It's all for your daughter's sake,
after all.

202
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
So I have to, right?
Is that what you're saying?

203
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,680
You don't have to.

204
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,040
I just thought I should help you
see things clearly.

205
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,280
I'm hanging up now.

206
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,400
All right.

207
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,680
I think it's time I found
the courage to talk about it.

208
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,480
You asked if the two things were related.

209
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,480
What happened is…

210
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,000
The eviction fire that occurred back then
was all over the news.

211
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
But like most stories these days,

212
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,920
once the flames died down,
so did the attention.

213
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,000
The main reason was that

214
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,400
there was no solid evidence
linking it to the culprit.

215
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,080
Any media outlet that tried to dig deeper

216
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,120
would get mysterious threatening calls.

217
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,600
All the media stepped back,
one after another.

218
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Only Pornnapa and I kept digging.

219
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,600
These are all key pieces of evidence.

220
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,720
Aren't you even a little excited?

221
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Where did you get it?

222
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,360
From my source
inside Kritsana Real Estate.

223
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
They said there's a lot more evidence

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,960
as long as their safety is guaranteed.

225
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,400
How did you come to know this source?

226
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,720
Through a middleman.

227
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,680
Why are you asking so many questions?

228
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,280
What I'm saying is,
we need to follow up on this.

229
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,560
If this info gets exposed

230
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,720
those parasites at Kritsana Real Estate
are going down for sure.

231
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,560
Well…

232
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,000
let's hand this evidence over
to the police.

233
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,960
Okay?

234
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,200
What's wrong?

235
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
Are you scared?

236
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,200
You know full well that all news outlets
have stopped digging into this now

237
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,840
because they know what they'll be
up against if they keep reporting.

238
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,520
You've been a journalist long enough.
You should know that.

239
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,560
Hey, honey.

240
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,120
We're the media.

241
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,560
No real journalist runs from the truth.

242
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,400
You think I'm scared for my own sake?

243
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,040
Before I met you, you also know

244
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,040
I reported stories like this
countless times.

245
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,520
But now it's different.

246
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,640
I have you.

247
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,520
I have Sairung.

248
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,720
Try to understand me, please.

249
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,480
Hey.

250
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,640
Don't use your family as an excuse.

251
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,760
If you were born to be a journalist,

252
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,280
then your job is to report
the truth, right?

253
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,800
Your daughter and I
know exactly why you have to do it.

254
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,120
Understanding alone is not enough.
Safety matters too!

255
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm worried about Sairung's safety too.

256
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,880
But what I'm even more worried about is

257
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,080
Sairung growing up and finding out

258
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,160
that her parents weren't brave enough
to fight for the truth because of her.

259
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm even prepared to die

260
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,000
if that's what it takes for her
to see me as a good mom.

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,920
I won't let my daughter see me as a coward

262
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,640
who's afraid of the ones
destroying this country.

263
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,040
Fine.

264
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,880
I'll do it myself.

265
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,200
Dad.

266
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,080
Why's Mom coming home late these days?

267
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,480
It's just during this period.

268
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,320
That's Mom's car! Where's she going?

269
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,840
Dad, what's Mom doing here?

270
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,640
Working, dear.

271
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
Let's go to her.

272
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,680
She's working.

273
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,320
We'd better not disturb her.

274
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,160
Let's wait until she finishes her work.

275
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,480
Let's surprise her then.

276
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,800
Good evening, Mrs. Pornnapa.

277
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
How did you come to know this source?

278
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,760
Through a middleman.

279
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,680
Let's get inside.

280
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,880
I know well…

281
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,160
how much it would hurt Sairung

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
if she knew what her mom traded
for that info.

283
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
And things were just getting
worse and worse.

284
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,880
What are you doing in the dark?

285
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,800
Shouldn't you be sleeping by now?

286
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,880
I can't sleep.

287
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,560
We need to talk.

288
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,640
Has Sairung gone to bed already?

289
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,560
If you're asking me to stop covering
the eviction fire case,

290
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,600
I've already made up my mind.

291
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,680
So let's not waste time talking about it.

292
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,240
I'm more curious about
how you got that piece of evidence.

293
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,000
Why were you at that hotel?

294
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,320
So you've been following me?

295
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,040
Instead of helping expose the truth, you
turn around and choose not to trust me?

296
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,200
You want to talk about trust?

297
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,000
I saw you with another man
with my own eyes.

298
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
That guy, right?

299
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,720
Your so-called inside source
who gave you the information.

300
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,120
So it's true.

301
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,840
Is this what you mean by,
"The press must not fear the truth"?

302
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
But the way you went after the truth

303
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,840
was so damn disgusting.

304
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,160
I know it was disgusting.

305
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,840
But it was the only way I could get
my hands on the info.

306
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,680
You think you're some ideal journalist,
don't you?

307
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,440
But do you even realize?

308
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,320
You're a damn terrible mother.

309
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,640
If truth has to come at that cost,

310
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,600
and if, as someone small,
I can do something, shouldn't I?

311
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,480
If no one dares to do it, then where
the heck does truth even stand?

312
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,240
Then where do I stand?

313
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,960
And where does Sairung stand?

314
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,560
Do you even realize how dangerous this is?

315
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,120
Do you know I get threatening calls
every single day?

316
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,520
I didn't tell you because
I didn't want you to be frightened.

317
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,960
And the way you got
that so-called truth… that's just…

318
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,920
All right.

319
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
I'll give you one more chance.

320
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,880
Drop this story

321
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,080
and cut ties with that source.

322
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,920
No.

323
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,600
And I want you to keep going with me,

324
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,120
so my sacrifice doesn't go to waste.

325
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,240
Can you do that?

326
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,440
Fine.

327
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,360
If you won't stop,

328
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,320
don't expect to ever see
your daughter again.

329
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,240
But that wasn't just a threat.

330
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,160
I really took Sairung to stay
at my house upcountry.

331
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,640
I didn't want her to see
her Mom and Dad fighting.

332
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,480
And I wanted Pornnapa
to have time to clear her head.

333
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,080
Because what matters most is our daughter,

334
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,840
not the job.

335
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,600
- Yeah!
- Yes, we're home.

336
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,000
Why do you always take me out?

337
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,160
Are you fighting with Mom again?

338
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,800
Here's the deal.

339
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,040
I promise that Mom and I
won't fight anymore.

340
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,040
I promise.

341
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,320
Let's go in.

342
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
Okay.

343
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,160
No running!

344
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,320
Watch your step.

345
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,080
Mom, I'm back.

346
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,920
Mom, are you asleep?

347
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Mom!

348
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,400
Dad, something's wrong with Mom!

349
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,160
Honey.

350
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,720
Honey!

351
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,000
Honey.

352
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,000
Hello.

353
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,000
I've got an injured person here.
It's an emergency.

354
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,440
Please hurry!

355
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,760
I don't know. I don't know. Please hurry!

356
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,440
I don't know what happened to her.

357
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,760
What she saw that day was too much
for Sairung at such a young age.

358
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,560
Sairung also believes

359
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,040
that was what caused her DID.

360
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,760
Then why is Sairung so interested
in Kritsana's case?

361
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,040
Did she somehow know…

362
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,720
her mom had evidence to expose Kritsana?

363
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,040
I'm not sure about that either.

364
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,840
When did she start looking into this case?

365
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
Probably when she was in college.

366
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,400
So, once you graduate, what kind
of job do you plan to do, Pat?

367
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
Another tough question.
I haven't really thought about it.

368
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,840
Whatever Sairung does, I'll do that too.

369
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,040
With my weird condition,
what could I possibly do?

370
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,480
Come on.

371
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,160
You've got the advantage.

372
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,320
You can do so many things
with all those people inside.

373
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
Is that something to joke about?

374
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,600
Should I ask Storm to come out
and give you a good slap?

375
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,560
I was just kidding.

376
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,000
What if I wanted to apply
to join Truth Today,

377
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,720
run by the once-famous journalist
Mr. Theppachai?

378
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,120
Would you take me?

379
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,560
If you're up for it, be my guest.

380
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,960
Soon, a real estate project
worth hundreds of millions of baht,

381
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,320
led by property tycoon Kritsana,
is set to launch.

382
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,800
This development is highly anticipated,

383
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,720
and marks a major milestone
for Kritsana Real Estate,

384
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,480
as it'll position the company

385
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,440
among the top five real estate firms
in Thailand.

386
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,840
Those corrupt bastards.

387
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,040
Everyone knows they operate in the grey,
but no one can touch them.

388
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,080
Hey, Pat.

389
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,880
If I'm a journalist
and I find solid evidence,

390
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
I'll expose every part of
his crooked business.

391
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,920
That's enough, Pat.

392
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,880
Why, sir?

393
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,320
We're journalists. If something's wrong,
it's our job to bring it to light, right?

394
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
Don't tell me

395
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,200
Truth Today is scared of those with power?

396
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,120
That's enough, Pat.

397
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,360
Mom…

398
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,520
Kritsana.

399
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,960
Sairung?

400
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,840
Mom didn't kill herself.

401
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,800
- What did you say, Sairung?
- Mom didn't kill herself.

402
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,360
- What did you say?
- Pat!

403
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,400
Stop talking about it already.

404
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm begging you.

405
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,880
So,

406
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,440
your wife did take her own life?

407
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,280
At the time,
Pornnapa was under a lot of stress.

408
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
The pills she took

409
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
were the same ones she always used
when she was anxious.

410
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,360
But with everything that was happening
with work, with our daughter,

411
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,760
she probably took too many.

412
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,880
It was an overdose

413
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,600
and her body couldn't take it.

414
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,680
Then why doesn't Fahsai believe
it was suicide?

415
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
She's just a kid.

416
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,680
She loved her mom so much.

417
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,720
She refuses to believe her mom
took her own life because

418
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,600
that would mean
her mom chose to leave her.

419
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,880
What will you do now?

420
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,800
I want Sairung to stop digging.

421
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,120
And who could possibly stop her?

422
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,800
What's the matter now?

423
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,080
Why are we meeting again?

424
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,320
That day, we didn't finish our talk
because Fahsai wasn't feeling well,

425
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,080
and it still bothers me.

426
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,800
How sacred are our rules, really,
if you can just ignore them?

427
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,520
I told you already,
I was just there trying to help Fahsai.

428
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,680
Why didn't you ask first
if she wanted you to?

429
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,200
Marnmok…

430
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
I appreciate your help.

431
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,280
I believe you did it with good intentions.

432
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,880
But as Sairung, Prai-Fon, and Storm said,

433
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,480
sometimes, facing the pain

434
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,160
might be the only way to heal
this panic inside me.

435
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,960
I want to feel it just once.

436
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,240
The pain.

437
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,240
If I never face it,
I'll never be able to overcome it.

438
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,000
But even if I lose,

439
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,680
I'll become stronger.

440
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,440
And another thing.

441
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,720
I was with Sun that day.

442
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,320
I believed he could take care of me.

443
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,360
Sun's the other thing that worries me.

444
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,120
Sun is stepping into our lives

445
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,160
and making everything more complicated.

446
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,560
I can't let him mess with us.

447
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,280
- But I don't think--
- Sun isn't Pat.

448
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,920
Can you just open up?

449
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
Open up?

450
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,520
You mean opening up and getting tricked
into drinking, Sairung?

451
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,560
You too, Prai-Fon.

452
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,440
How could you trust him enough
to go to a love motel with him?

453
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,680
Storm too.

454
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,280
What is it you're trying to prove?

455
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,280
Marnmok, have you been secretly
following us while we're in the light?

456
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,400
I admit that I've done that.

457
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,200
But I'm only awake when I know
you're doing something risky.

458
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,920
I don't know everything you all do.

459
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,120
All I've ever done
is protect the five of us.

460
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,960
But in the end,
Sun proved he could be trusted.

461
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,880
Otherwise, I wouldn't be back here.

462
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,880
I believe Sun can take care of me.

463
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,320
But we've been taking care
of one another for this long.

464
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,440
- Why do we need anyone else now?
- We've grown up now.

465
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,400
You need to let us make our own choices.

466
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,600
Quit trying to be our mom.

467
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,080
It's because I lost Mom!

468
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,920
That's why I can't bear to lose
any of you again!

469
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,080
Stop being afraid already, Marnmok.

470
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,200
The more different we are from others,

471
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,120
the more we have to face the truth.

472
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,920
If we don't fight,

473
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,000
we'll only end up losing.

474
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,320
We lost Mom.

475
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,120
Can we bring her back?

476
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,520
The one thing that we lost
but can still find again

477
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,320
is love.

478
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,720
Though a new love

479
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,960
can't compare to Mom's love,

480
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,400
it can still give us hope

481
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,400
and help us live on, Marnmok.

482
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,720
To live in the body of a survivor

483
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,120
means living with no way
to escape the pain.

484
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,280
Prai-Fon.

485
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,520
I…

486
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,080
will try to understand you all.

487
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,480
You are me.

488
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,120
I am you.

489
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't want to cause any more pain.

490
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,880
Sounds good.

491
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,200
It's Storm's turn tomorrow.

492
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,760
Is there anything
I should be worried about?

493
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,320
Didn't you say you trusted us?

494
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,000
There's just something I need to sort out.

495
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,200
But it's nothing risky.

496
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,160
Sort out what? With whom?

497
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,560
With Sun, maybe.

498
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,480
Whoa… good gracious!

499
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,800
This has gotten way too complicated.

500
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,080
Let's call it quits.
I don't think it's worth it anymore.

501
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,520
You can't quit.

502
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,880
I still have the blackmail clip.

503
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,080
Sis…

504
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,880
Can't you delete it?

505
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,160
Come on, please delete it.

506
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,520
Honestly, I'm starting to get confused.

507
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,480
Whose side should I even take?

508
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,000
Yours or Boss Thep's?

509
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,200
And Sairung…

510
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,840
I only realized how dramatic
it really was today.

511
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,920
I feel bad for her.

512
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,080
She went through so much pain.

513
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,760
It makes sense now
why her personality shattered.

514
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,640
I don't know what Boss Thep is thinking.

515
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,920
His daughter just went through
something traumatic,

516
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,360
and he hired this rogue
and this rascal to help?

517
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,440
I can't believe him.

518
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,600
Come on, sis.
Don't add fuel to the fire now.

519
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,360
You probably just need money,
you don't actually care.

520
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,960
Hey, De.

521
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Since when was Gudji on our team?

522
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
I called you in for a meeting.
Why'd you bring her along?

523
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,360
Because I'm worried about Sairung.

524
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,360
She has to be with bad guys like you two.

525
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,240
Damn!

526
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,920
Stop holding grudges already.

527
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
It's all in the past.

528
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,040
You've never really been in love, right?
You don't seem to get it at all.

529
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,720
That's why you're so damn heartless
and ruthless as hell.

530
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,000
- Take it easy, sis. Please stop.
- Hey, De.

531
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,440
Let's talk later then.

532
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,320
And don't bring her again
or we'll never get anywhere.

533
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,840
You play with women's hearts
and call it work?

534
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,120
How can you do that?

535
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,920
- You're such a total…
- Sis, no!

536
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,200
Please stop, my lovely sis.

537
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,760
I'm heading out.

538
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,960
No, sis.

539
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,440
Let's go.

540
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,680
His daughter just went through
something traumatic,

541
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,520
and he hired this rogue
and this rascal to help?

542
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,800
This made me think of Mom.

543
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,720
Thank you so much.

544
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,880
- Mom didn't kill herself. She didn't.
- Who did?

545
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,680
Because I'm worried about Sairung.

546
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,480
She has to be with bad guys like you two.

547
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,880
Why did I get so worked up like that?

548
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,720
I've never been this mad at anyone before.

549
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
True.

550
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,120
You blew up out of nowhere.

551
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,160
I was confused too. What got into you?

552
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,400
I'm on my period!

553
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,520
Okay, got it. Case closed.

554
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,440
All clear.

555
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,880
But being on my period doesn't mean
I'd be this hurt for no reason.

556
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,000
When I was heartbroken, it was real.

557
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,760
Not all women are the same.

558
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,800
Some can take heartbreak.

559
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,920
But I'm the type who loves hard,

560
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
so when it hurts, it hurts so bad.

561
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,760
Sis, but you and Sun
weren't together that long.

562
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,680
Why are you this mad at him?

563
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,160
What if I told you Sun was my first love?

564
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,440
Shit! For real?

565
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,400
Excuse me.
One more bottle of beer, please.

566
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,159
I know that I'm an adult.

567
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,920
I should understand it was just work.

568
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,600
But messing with love is already hard,

569
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,719
and for someone like me,
who'd never been in love before,

570
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,280
it was even harder, right?

571
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,960
I went to an all-girls school.

572
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,880
I'd never been that close to a guy before.

573
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,760
When I fell in love, I fell hard.

574
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,719
And when I fell hard,
I couldn't hold my heart in.

575
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,080
I just couldn't stop how I felt.

576
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,960
Then, out of nowhere, it broke.

577
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,679
It hurt so bad, Sun, you idiot!

578
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Seriously,

579
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,400
I know I probably seem totally wasted
and out of it right now,

580
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,240
on my period and talking nonsense,

581
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,840
but deep down in my heart,

582
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,320
it's as messy as what I'm saying, De.

583
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,680
Sis.

584
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,520
I want to help you.

585
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,680
How?

586
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,520
By being my boyfriend?

587
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
Yes.

588
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
You gonna fix my broken heart?

589
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,840
Yes, of course.

590
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,320
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

591
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,760
I think I do.

592
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,960
All right then.

593
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,800
You're my boyfriend from this second on.

594
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,440
Trust me.

595
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,360
Once she's sober, she won't even
remember this moment.

596
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,960
Damn it.

597
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,040
Hello, Dog Fight Gym, how can we help you?

598
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,680
I'd like to train with Coach Chatch.

599
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,720
Please hold on. Let me check for you.

600
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,520
Coach Chatch…

601
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,720
He's fully booked right now.

602
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,640
- How about in the evening?
- Evening?

603
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,560
Yes, okay-- Oh, wait.

604
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,920
Actually, not okay.

605
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,120
Coach Chatch just let us know
he's taking the evening off.

606
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
But you said okay.

607
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,000
Sorry, I just saw his note.

608
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,000
It must be something urgent.

609
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,440
Last-minute like this,
maybe he got called into work.

610
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,680
Work?

611
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,440
I really need to see him.
I want to ask him about some techniques.

612
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,600
You can try catching him
in the evening before he leaves.

613
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,600
All right. Thanks.

614
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,080
Bro, are we seriously having
this conversation in this weird position?

615
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,000
You're the one
who turned around like that!

616
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,800
Fine, let me show you.

617
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,440
Doesn't it feel like a scene from an AV?

618
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,120
Now sit up.

619
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,080
Wanna kiss?

620
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,800
Like fitness couples do.

621
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,400
Did you wash your face
and brush your teeth today?

622
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,360
No, I didn't wanna.

623
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,320
And I'm not gonna!

624
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,760
Eww, that's gross.

625
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Are you crazy? Why didn't you
clean up after waking up?

626
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,240
I was just having a moment.

627
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,600
What moment? What did you do yesterday?

628
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,760
Like…

629
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,280
Like… like…

630
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,560
A moment with Gudji?

631
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,440
You went to that somtum place
with her yesterday?

632
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,880
Oh, come on! Are you a snake or what?

633
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,840
What the hell is this
"ngui ngab" gibberish!

634
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,360
'Cause I had my moment…

635
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,560
Decha!

636
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,560
A rogue like you wouldn't even know
what a good moment feels like.

637
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,000
Anyway, why are we talking here?

638
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,160
Today is Storm's turn.

639
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,480
Big storm, remember?

640
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Oh, right on cue.

641
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,000
Last time,

642
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,280
I went boxing with Storm, right?

643
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,800
I didn't warm up.

644
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,800
I ended up with really bad back pain.

645
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,080
I got it.

646
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,240
So, what's this stormy girl up to today?

647
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,880
Are you going in the ring with her again?

648
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,080
Oh, right.

649
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,200
I don't know where Storm is today.

650
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,520
She didn't pick up my call this morning,
and she still hasn't replied to my texts.

651
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,560
Hey!

652
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,400
Can you track where she is right now?

653
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,400
That's the easiest job ever.

654
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
But before that,

655
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,640
go brush your damn teeth, you gross thing.

656
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Not gonna!

657
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,600
Done, sir.

658
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,440
Wow. Seriously.

659
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,280
You're such a genius.

660
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,320
No wonder you're my AV partner.

661
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,120
Hold the flattery.

662
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,520
I threw in an extra one for you.

663
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,360
Chatch who?

664
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,520
Coach Chatch.

665
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,880
Coach Chatch from the boxing gym?

666
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,040
Storm seems very interested in him, right?

667
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,680
So I dug around a bit

668
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,840
and served it up for you, bro.

669
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,880
Seriously, you rascal, De.

670
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,520
You're truly my beloved bro.

671
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,800
But I want you to take a look at this.

672
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,600
"Body of Middle-Aged
Real Estate Tycoon Found by Riverbank."

673
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,720
"Suspect Apprehended Immediately."

674
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,760
"Motive Remains Unclear."

675
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,800
That's Coach Chatch!

676
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,320
Does Storm know about this?

677
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,600
BODY FOUND BY RIVERBANK
MOTIVE REMAINS UNCLEAR

678
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,400
Shit.

679
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,120
Looks like Storm's
heading to Coach Chatch.

680
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,080
Take this with you.

681
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,520
It might come in handy.

682
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,440
But…

683
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,120
only hit the button if you really have to.

684
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,680
Boxers may know how to punch,

685
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,120
but if they can't see you,

686
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,240
they can't hit you, right?

687
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,520
- Follow that bike.
- Yes, miss.

688
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
I've got De.

689
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,480
Do I still need to rush?

690
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,560
STORM, CHATCH

691
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,920
Why is he following Storm?

692
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,200
Pat? Why is he following Sun?

693
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,160
And where's Sun following Storm to?

694
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,120
And why's Storm following Coach Chatch?

695
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,480
And who am I following now?

696
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,320
Could this get any more complicated?

697
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,160
Why are you following me?

698
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,520
I need to ask you something, Coach.

699
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Is that Storm?

700
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,960
I just realized why you look familiar.

701
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,840
If you were wearing a black dress,
yeah, I remember.

702
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,920
You remember me?

703
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,840
Seems like I saw you at an event.

704
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,400
Which event?

705
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,800
An art event.

706
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,560
Art event…

707
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,280
Black dress?

708
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,040
That was Sairung.

709
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,680
My boss likes you.

710
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
Nothing more.

711
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,000
So why are you following me?

712
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,120
Where are you heading?

713
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,080
I wanted to train with you but they said
you had some urgent business.

714
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,480
What do you want, girl?

715
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,560
It's just a job.

716
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,480
BODY FOUND BY RIVERBANK
MOTIVE REMAINS UNCLEAR

717
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,480
You got a death wish?

718
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,680
You followed me here!

719
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,800
Come on in, girl.

720
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,600
Whatever you want to know,

721
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,640
come ask it close to my face.

722
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,520
Storm, stop it here.

723
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,920
We've talked, Marnmok.

724
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,240
Have a little faith in me, Marn.

725
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,600
Come on in, girl.

726
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,520
De!

727
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,720
Knock yourself out.

728
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,160
This is my favorite place.

729
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,200
You never run out of surprises.

730
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,880
I like you so much.

731
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,480
So, what now?

732
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,680
There's nothing much to it.

733
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,680
We're just grabbing a bite to eat
and some coffee, that's all.

734
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,760
I'm just asking because I want to know
how you really feel about Sun.

735
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,760
Have you already fallen for Sun?
