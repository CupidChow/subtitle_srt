1
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,840
WHAT TYPE OF GUY
ARE WOMEN MOST DRAWN TO?

2
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,560
<i>I'm such a sucker for well-dressed guys.</i>

3
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,680
<i>They don't even have to be glam,</i>
<i>just well put together.</i>

4
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,200
<i>That alone makes them attractive.</i>

5
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,040
<i>For real, girls.</i>

6
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
<i>Scent matters too.</i>

7
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,760
<i>Like they're always fresh</i>
<i>out of the shower.</i>

8
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,480
<i>That's definitely a win.</i>

9
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,600
<i>As for looks,</i>

10
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,160
<i>no need to be super handsome.</i>

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,560
<i>Just decent-looking is enough.</i>

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
<i>At least if you get your heart broken,</i>

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,560
<i>you know you cried over</i>
<i>someone good-looking.</i>

14
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,240
Have a good day, Sun.

15
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,400
<i>Should we look for green flags too?</i>

16
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,040
<i>Like, is there even a guy</i>
<i>who ticks all the boxes?</i>

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,680
<i>But at the very least,</i>
<i>I want someone polite</i>

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,720
<i>who cares about people around them.</i>

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
<i>Today's sure gonna be a good day</i>

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,320
<i>because it started with your smile, Mook.</i>

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,800
<i>Or the guys who help others out in public.</i>
<i>That's pretty impressive too.</i>

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,280
- Watch out, miss! Miss!
- Oh!

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,880
Hey!

24
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,520
How about an apology?

25
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,240
Or should I just send your license plate
photo to the police?

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,200
Sorry.

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,640
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,480
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,520
<i>Oh, I just noticed</i>
<i>there's a guy in the audience.</i>

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,960
<i>Would you like to come up</i>
<i>and share your thoughts?</i>

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,880
Hi… I guess I've been caught.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,000
I just wanted to listen in

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,240
and see what women think.

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,960
It might help me improve myself.

35
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,400
<i>But sometimes,</i>

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
<i>we'd like to hear from the guys too.</i>

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,440
<i>Do you mind if I ask you</i>
<i>something in return?</i>

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,640
<i>Do men believe in love at first sight,</i>
<i>like women do?</i>

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,960
Love at first sight?

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,120
I think…

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,680
it's possible.

42
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,040
Hey, boy!

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,480
She already paid. Give that to me.

44
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,960
What's this got to do with you?
Is she your girlfriend?

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,120
- No.
- Do you know her?

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,120
No.

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,520
Secret admirer?

48
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,960
Just give it to me, come on.

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,440
Now go! Watch out for cars too.

50
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,840
<i>Where are you now?</i>

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,839
<i>Mr. Sun, are you still there?</i>

52
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,360
Yeah, I am.

53
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,160
I just want to say

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,480
that for love at first sight to happen,

55
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,120
you have to be completely unattached.

56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
But right now,

57
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,880
that's not the case for me because

58
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,840
there's already someone I'm focused on.

59
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,240
Here we are.

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
Where are you taking me?

61
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,440
Don't open your eyes just yet.

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,680
All right. You can get out now.

63
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
Keep your eyes closed.

64
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,640
Take a few steps forward.

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,160
Here we are.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,720
One, two, three!

67
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,560
Huh? What is this?

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,160
You're taking me to a haunted house?

69
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
No, it's this.

70
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,680
What's with the teasing?

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,120
Isn't it more fun to be surprised twice?

72
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,120
Did you have to go all out like this?

73
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
What's the occasion?

74
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,440
It's our 15-day anniversary.

75
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,120
This way, ma'am.

76
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Thank you.

77
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,880
Feels like a dinner by the Han River,
like in a K-drama.

78
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,600
Do I give off K-drama lead vibes?

79
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,320
Well, if we're talking Lee Min-ho,

80
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,240
Bo-gum, Cha Eun-woo, and Jaehyun,

81
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,960
there's no way
I'd ever get to date any of them.

82
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,960
But the luckiest thing is…

83
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,800
I have you, Sun.

84
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,520
You can make me smile wider
than those four.

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,560
I never thought I could feel this great,

86
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
not just today,

87
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,080
but ever since the first day we met.

88
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,440
I know it hasn't been that long…

89
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
but every day we've talked…

90
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
I've kept thinking over and over

91
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,440
about what this feeling really is.

92
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,360
And today, I'm sure…

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,720
that this feeling I have
just keeps growing.

94
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,080
Are you going to take this seriously?

95
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,840
Then I will too.

96
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
Let's end it right here.

97
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,240
What?

98
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,560
Then why'd you even do all this?

99
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
It's a send-off.

100
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,800
It's exhausting having to do all this
just to please you.

101
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,960
You know, the standards you've set,

102
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,560
they're too high for real life.

103
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,760
Try living in reality for once.

104
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,799
Enjoy your meal.
Consider it my farewell treat.

105
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,520
Sun, go rot in hell!

106
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,600
<i>Job No. 7/2005 is complete. Gudji.</i>

107
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,720
She raises the bar so high
for men to reach

108
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,280
and romanticizes love
like it's some K-drama fantasy

109
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,120
when in reality, it's just not possible.

110
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
She deserves to stay single.

111
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,920
There's no such thing as true love.

112
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,600
Love is just a tool for my work,
nothing more.

113
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Please get out of your car, sir.

114
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,440
Make sure you clean
every corner thoroughly.

115
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,440
I want to take this
as washing away the bad luck.

116
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,880
That's Earnearn 6/2025.

117
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,320
Want me to take a photo for you?

118
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,280
EARNEARN 6/2025

119
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,080
<i>A woman who cheats</i>
<i>deserves to be cheated on too.</i>

120
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,920
Sure.

121
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,800
Shit!

122
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,320
I'll come back to pick up my car later.

123
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,800
Hey!

124
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,520
Go, go, go!

125
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,240
That was almost karma coming for you.

126
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,560
I told you,

127
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,880
angry women are the scariest.

128
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,640
When it was her doing it to someone else,
she didn't seem to feel sorry at all.

129
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,280
I did everything exactly the same
as Earnearn did.

130
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,640
I copied every single detail
down to the last step.

131
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,680
I just did what she did to our client.

132
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,520
And that was something that
happened long ago.

133
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,680
Imagine if it were a fresh wound.

134
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,200
Whoa. She would've gone full meltdown.

135
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,520
Like Gudji…

136
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,040
<i>You asshole!</i>

137
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
<i>Absolute piece of shit!</i>

138
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,840
<i>Sun, you jerk! I hope you die tomorrow!</i>

139
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,400
So brutal.

140
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,000
The angrier they are,

141
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,840
the more it means
we struck the right spot.

142
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,320
Exactly.

143
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
But you've gotta give me some credit.

144
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,160
I dug up all the info you needed

145
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,960
so you could finish each job perfectly.

146
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,280
Maybe a bit overboard, actually.

147
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,760
But seriously,

148
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,240
taking breakup gigs just to get revenge?

149
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,120
Does that really make sense?

150
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,880
7 YEARS AGO

151
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Gale,

152
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,240
for you.

153
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,880
Hey, hey.

154
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,280
Can't you two wait until you're alone?

155
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,880
This is kinda awkward for me, you know.

156
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,320
That's exactly what I feel.

157
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,880
That's why I brought you along.

158
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,480
I wouldn't have the guts
to give it to her.

159
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,480
So what now?

160
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Every time you two go on a date,
I have to come too?

161
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,200
Honestly, it'd be great
to have you with us.

162
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,080
Otherwise, Chin gets so shy
he won't do anything.

163
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,280
GALE: I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS,
I WANT TO HAVE YOU AROUND.

164
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,480
Why'd you want to see me?

165
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
You got something to tell me?

166
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
Let's start with you.

167
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,960
You look like shit.

168
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,960
What's going on?

169
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,200
Man…

170
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,840
I found out

171
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,640
that Gale's seeing a bunch of guys.

172
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,360
She tried the same thing with me.

173
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,800
That's what I wanted to tell you.

174
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,320
What?

175
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,320
I'm seriously pissed, man.

176
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,320
What can I do to make her hurt like I do?

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,000
Just leave it to karma.

178
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,560
I'm supposed to wait
until the day she dies?

179
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,600
We're friends, aren't we?

180
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,360
<i>Help me get back at Gale.</i>

181
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,800
GALE 1/2018
FIRST JOB

182
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,680
<i>Sleep soon or you'll get sick.</i>

183
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,560
Are you sure about this?

184
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,800
Out of all the guys I'm seeing,

185
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,800
I like you the most.

186
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,160
Ow!

187
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,560
But I feel nothing.

188
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,000
I just wanted to have some fun

189
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,640
just like what you did to my friend.

190
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
You asshole, Sun!

191
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,560
GALE 1/2018
JOB DONE

192
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,280
Damn.

193
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,640
This is your freakin' gift.

194
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,920
You could make a living off this.
You'd be rich.

195
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,640
Come on.

196
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,760
Don't go that far.
It's not exactly decent.

197
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,640
Then just do it
to the ones who deserve it,

198
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,560
like those cheating, two-timing girls.

199
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,640
When they get hurt, they'll think twice
before doing it to someone else.

200
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,760
Because they've got you,

201
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
love karma in the flesh,

202
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,240
coming for them in this lifetime!

203
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,240
Serves them right.

204
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,760
You do bad, you get what you deserve.

205
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,440
Karma just showed up
a little faster than usual, that's all.

206
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,520
Being the asshole in someone's life

207
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,080
is something not everyone can pull off.

208
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,600
But you can.

209
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,520
Is that a compliment?

210
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,840
I guess, yes.

211
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,600
Anyway,

212
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560
where's my pay?

213
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,760
Now stop overthinking it.

214
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,560
It's this pay

215
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,600
that answers everything.

216
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,480
Think about it, man.

217
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,080
The more cases we get,

218
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,600
the more money we make.

219
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,480
If this is a sin,

220
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,800
then I'll call it

221
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,920
a sin that puts food on the table.

222
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,960
Just thinking out loud here,

223
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,400
but if all those people knew each other

224
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,000
and teamed up to get revenge on you,

225
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,120
I'm telling you,

226
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,280
the day that happens,

227
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,840
it'll be hell on earth for you.

228
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,880
The deepest level of hell.

229
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,240
So deep no one's digging you out.

230
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,880
Damn you. Watch your mouth.

231
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,360
Or I'll smack it right off your face.

232
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,720
Are you even on my side or what?

233
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm always on your side.

234
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,360
I love you the most, you know.

235
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,240
Even if you're a total asshole,
I still love you.

236
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,040
Let's just say,

237
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,800
once I land a big, juicy sin

238
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,440
that brings in serious money,

239
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,640
I'll quit this job for you, ladies.

240
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,880
I need to go now.

241
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,320
Where are you going?

242
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,000
We just got a new job in.

243
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,480
Nah, I need a break.

244
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
- Let me be myself for now.
- All right, see you.

245
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,320
LIGHT AND SHADOW GALLERY

246
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,880
You know what else
candid street photos are called?

247
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,320
Sneak shots.

248
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
If you'd just asked nicely,

249
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,720
the photos would've turned out better.

250
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,160
"Sauvage."

251
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,880
Do you have to call me
something that harsh?

252
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,800
It's your perfume.

253
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,320
So you're not mad
about the other day anymore?

254
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,120
The other day?

255
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,760
If I had a deep night with someone,

256
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,200
I'd remember them all,

257
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,240
but I don't remember you.

258
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,920
Not that.

259
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,880
There's not only one kind
of "deep night," right?

260
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,920
Talk for ten minutes
and it's already deep.

261
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,480
But we met during the day.

262
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,599
And the stuff you bought

263
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,280
is still with me.

264
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,280
Okay, there's a storyline.

265
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,720
That's kinda cute.

266
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,240
But honestly, that whole
"have we met before" pickup line?

267
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,880
I don't think it really works anymore.

268
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,079
Or maybe…

269
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,680
maybe it still does.

270
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,280
Because I want to get to know you now.

271
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,440
Everyone!

272
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,040
Stop the corrupt monopolies.

273
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,320
Stand against the power
that exploits the powerless.

274
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,920
Stop the corrupt monopolies.

275
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,520
Stand against the power
that exploits the powerless.

276
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,720
Stop the corrupt monopolies.

277
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,840
Stand against the power
that exploits the powerless.

278
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,920
Stop the corrupt monopolies.

279
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,320
Stand against the power
that exploits the powerless.

280
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
You really think this is gonna work?

281
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
STOP CORRUPT MONOPOLIES

282
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,760
If I don't shout,

283
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,000
no one's gonna hear me, right?

284
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,640
Are you the owner of this painting
or something?

285
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,160
No, but it bothers me.

286
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,760
Honestly, I get you.

287
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,600
I get your method too.

288
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,880
But the people you should be targeting

289
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,760
are the ones who actually wronged you,

290
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,720
not the owner of this painting.

291
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,720
You think?

292
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,920
Well, now my target…

293
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,840
is you.

294
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,960
You okay?

295
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,960
Hey… what's your name?

296
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,360
Sun.

297
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,720
I'm Sairung.

298
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,800
Help record all of this for me.

299
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,280
If this is how you want to do it,

300
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,760
then why don't we create
something together?

301
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,640
You can do whatever you want with it

302
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,360
because it won't involve
anyone else anymore.

303
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,640
Now,

304
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,080
you get to say what you want to say
with your whole self.

305
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,440
And I think

306
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,680
this way, it'll be even louder.

307
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
STOP CORRUPT MONOPOLIES

308
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,400
She's so cool.

309
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,840
How did she do that?

310
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,800
How did she do that?

311
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,280
Miss. Miss?

312
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,960
Miss!

313
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,800
ART BOMBER GETS BOMBED BACK,
HAHAHAHA.

314
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,920
Do I still look good?

315
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,080
Thanks for helping out earlier.

316
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,640
Can I treat you as a thank-you?

317
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,800
That line is just as old as
the "have we met before" line.

318
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,520
Then forget the thank-you treat.

319
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,720
Would you like to come?

320
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,600
I want someone with me tonight.

321
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,080
I thought it'd be nice if it were you.

322
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,120
Wrong guess.

323
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,320
So… what's the punishment?

324
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,640
Take a shot of Devil Kiss.

325
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,680
It'll be fun.

326
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,960
Hello, hello. It's time.

327
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,480
Are you guys wasted yet?

328
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,560
It's Saturday night.

329
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,280
Our regulars know it's Open Mic time.

330
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,480
OPEN MIC = TAKE THE MIC AND SING

331
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,440
Five.

332
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,840
Four.

333
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Three.

334
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,560
Two.

335
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,840
One.

336
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,040
No.

337
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,040
Come on.

338
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
There are so many other people.

339
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Come on.

340
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,080
No, no way.

341
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,640
Give it to other people.

342
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,400
Whoa.

343
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,800
She's so cool.

344
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,600
<i>If I'd never seen your smile</i>

345
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,120
<i>If you and I'd never locked eyes</i>

346
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,760
<i>When you're unaware, when you're shy</i>

347
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,240
<i>Had I not been right there</i>

348
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,760
<i>If we'd been just passersby</i>

349
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,000
<i>If, to me, you hadn't been so kind</i>

350
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,720
<i>My thoughts wouldn't wander</i>
<i>So far and high</i>

351
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,160
<i>Had I not been right here</i>

352
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,160
People who don't know us

353
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,440
might think you'd just confessed
your love to me.

354
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,000
Confessed my love?

355
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,280
That's a bit much, don't you think?

356
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,840
But maybe… someday.

357
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,960
Who knows?

358
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,320
<i>Too close not to have my thoughts wander</i>

359
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
<i>Too close for me to handle</i>

360
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,840
<i>Someone next to you trembles</i>

361
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,880
<i>Have you realized this at all?</i>

362
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,440
<i>The more I get closer</i>

363
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,280
<i>You seem to float away further</i>

364
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,320
<i>If one day I can't hold it in</i>

365
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,240
<i>Don't be mad if I catch feelings for you</i>

366
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,160
"Si."

367
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,440
SI: PERFUME NAME

368
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,960
You've got a sharp nose.

369
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,840
Were you a K9 agent before or something?

370
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,960
So I got it right?

371
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,480
<i>Si,</i> you're very right.

372
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,360
SI: YES

373
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,920
<i>This is probably one of</i>
<i>the first times in years</i>

374
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,200
<i>that my heart's actually</i>
<i>raced for someone.</i>

375
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,320
Watch out. You may slip.

376
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,640
I'm not gonna slip.

377
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,800
Look, it's not slippery at all.

378
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,640
Watch out, the ground's wet.

379
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,040
Hey.

380
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
You really don't remember
that face-changing doll?

381
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,800
No, I don't.

382
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,640
Just get rid of it.

383
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,000
That face-changing doll.

384
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
Time to say goodbye.

385
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,960
I need to go home.

386
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,360
I hope we meet again.

387
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,880
What…

388
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,480
What's gotten into you?

389
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,160
You were acting all tough before you left.

390
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,200
I got revived.

391
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,400
You're all over the place, man.

392
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,560
Well, snap out of it.

393
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,400
Help answer this client. They are waiting.

394
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,840
De, I really need a break.

395
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,120
I want to live a little.

396
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,480
What, bro?

397
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,760
Hey.

398
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,160
Don't tell me

399
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,360
you're falling for a girl
and thinking of changing yourself?

400
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,320
Oh, come on. No.

401
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,520
I'm not quitting this.

402
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,440
I just want a break, that's all.

403
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,280
- INTERESTED. PLEASE GET BACK TO ME ASAP.
- I CAN'T TAKE ON THIS JOB RIGHT NOW

404
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,280
Hey!

405
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,800
Are you out of your mind?

406
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,400
You don't care about work and money now?

407
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,760
THEPPACHAI

408
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,400
Hello.

409
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,360
<i>Hello.</i>

410
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
I'm not really available
for jobs right now.

411
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,880
I'm taking some time off.

412
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
<i>How about watching the clip I sent first?</i>

413
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,760
<i>Then let me know if you decide</i>
<i>to stop taking some time off.</i>

414
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,440
<i>He knows exactly what I like.</i>
<i>The type I'm weak for.</i>

415
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,560
<i>Feels like he was made to be</i>
<i>my perfect match.</i>

416
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,400
<i>Makes me fall in just a few days.</i>

417
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,120
<i>And in the end,</i>
<i>I fell right into his trap.</i>

418
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,520
<i>It's a send-off.</i>

419
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,520
<i>It's exhausting having to do all this</i>
<i>just to please you.</i>

420
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,040
<i>You know, the standards you've set,</i>

421
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,680
<i>they're too high for real life.</i>

422
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
<i>I'm hurt.</i>

423
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,600
<i>I'm so pissed. I'm mad.</i>

424
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,160
<i>I want revenge.</i>

425
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,120
"THE HEARTBREAKER FOR HIRE"

426
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,480
<i>Wasn't it fun?</i>

427
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,960
<i>Enjoyed it, didn't you?</i>

428
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,480
<i>That was just a teaser, Mr. Sun</i>

429
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,920
<i>The full clip has plenty more victims,</i>

430
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,520
<i>all ready to expose you.</i>

431
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,200
<i>If you don't want me to release</i>
<i>the full scoop,</i>

432
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,200
<i>come talk to me.</i>

433
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
<i>I'm sure you know where to find me.</i>

434
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,680
This is the place?

435
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,560
Don't die just yet.

436
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,200
Because I'm just getting started.

437
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,000
From now on,

438
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,240
you're my dream,

439
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,600
Mr. Sun.

440
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,080
You do know, right?

441
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,800
I never left you.

442
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,840
I walked you all the way
to hell's door myself.

443
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,200
But I'm not in the clip

444
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,400
so you're on your own now, bro.

445
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,640
You'll be my dream too.

446
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,760
You ungrateful bastard!

447
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,880
What are you waiting for?!

448
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Hey, here you are.

449
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,920
Come on. It was just a greeting.

450
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,320
I'm not gonna hurt you, come on.

451
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,520
Hello.

452
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm Theppachai.

453
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,360
Nice to finally meet you.

454
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,240
I think we should talk
in the meeting room.

455
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,200
There's a lot of details to go over.

456
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,160
Come on.

457
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,400
You can chug it down. It's not poisoned.

458
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,160
SCAMMER!!
WITH A BRAND-NEW TRICK!!

459
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,320
Well, you did mess her up pretty bad.

460
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,120
You should understand.

461
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,000
When girls get hurt, they act like this.

462
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,560
But I didn't think
she'd be this mad either.

463
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,080
Hey!

464
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,840
There, there. Okay, okay.

465
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,320
So this was your plan all along?

466
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,840
Using Gudji to trap me?

467
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,560
Yes!

468
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,360
I kinda had to.

469
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,120
It was the only way to meet you.

470
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,320
What do you want from me then?

471
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,200
You want this scoop
to go viral or something?

472
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,360
It's not what you think.

473
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,960
The truth is,

474
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,440
I want your help.

475
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,760
And it's something you're really good at.

476
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,480
So… who do you want me to break up with?

477
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,240
No, no breakups this time.

478
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,760
I actually want you to do the opposite.

479
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,800
Because the truth is,

480
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,200
your real talent is

481
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,640
how easily you make women fall for you.

482
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,040
Here's the proof.

483
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,280
Hey, would you stop it already?

484
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,240
I want you to flirt with my daughter.

485
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,520
None of that now.

486
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,360
If you don't do what I say,

487
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,200
I'll expose everything!

488
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,160
How did I get to this point?

489
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,040
So this really is your place.

490
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,760
I thought I had the wrong one.

491
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,960
Have you been following me since that day?

492
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,480
What kind of game are you playing today?

493
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,640
I can't keep up anymore.

494
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,600
You always keep me on my toes.

495
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,000
You dropped this,

496
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,840
so I wanted to return it.

497
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,920
Didn't you want to see me again?

498
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,320
What's with the familiarity?

499
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,440
Since when have we been close?

500
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,320
Are you crazy?

501
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,280
The person you met wasn't me.

502
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,680
Stop making things up.

503
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm so confused here.

504
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,360
Why are you pretending
you don't remember me?

505
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,960
If you're here to return something,

506
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,920
then give me back my doll.

507
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,080
I paid for it. It's mine.

508
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,000
Now… you remember that doll?

509
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,920
How could I not remember what's mine?

510
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,680
Now give it to me

511
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,200
and get out of my place.

512
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,480
It all feels bizarre.
There's got to be something I'm missing.

513
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,640
I don't get scammers these days either.

514
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,640
Too many tricks up their sleeves.

515
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,120
What are you and your daughter
trying to pull?

516
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,640
You want to blackmail me, I get that.

517
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,400
But messing with my head like this?
I don't get it.

518
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,160
You're not tricking me
for some dating reality show, right?

519
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,040
What the hell did you run into?

520
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
Actually, I've met your daughter before.

521
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,000
<i>I don't get scammers these days either.</i>

522
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,880
Too many tricks up their sleeves.

523
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,560
And now, suddenly,

524
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,560
I'm a scammer?

525
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,560
Seriously, what is all this?

526
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,400
Good.

527
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,840
Since you saw it for yourself,

528
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
this'll be easier for me to explain.

529
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,840
My daughter is not weird or anything.

530
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,120
When she says she doesn't remember,

531
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,720
she really doesn't.

532
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,120
Because

533
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,800
she's a completely different person.

534
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,520
I have just one daughter,

535
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,800
but she has…

536
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,960
five personalities.

537
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,239
And all five personalities
lead their own lives.

538
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,600
Your real job is,

539
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,159
you must flirt with my daughter,

540
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,040
and you must make all five of them

541
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,520
fall

542
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,360
in love

543
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,440
with

544
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,639
you

545
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,280
successfully!

546
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,440
Love karma

547
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,960
is really making a U-turn straight
back to me.

548
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,280
MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER

549
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,840
DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER:
A PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFENSE MECHANISM

550
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,200
WHERE A PERSON HAS TWO OR MORE
DISTINCT IDENTITIES OR PERSONALITY STATES

551
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,960
Multi personalities

552
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,120
like one person during the day,
another at night?

553
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,920
Something like that,
but it's more than that.

554
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,560
Like I said,

555
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,080
my daughter has five personalities.

556
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,600
Are you joking with me?

557
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,320
I wouldn't joke about
my daughter's condition.

558
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,160
She used to be

559
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,560
just like any other ordinary kid.

560
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,400
<i>Sairung was a sweet kid.</i>

561
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,160
<i>The three of us were</i>
<i>really happy together…</i>

562
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,840
<i>until</i>

563
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,840
<i>my wife passed away.</i>

564
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,360
<i>Sairung became a completely different kid.</i>

565
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,920
You've worn down the blue one.

566
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,760
Sharpen it.

567
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,160
You use it too, don't you?

568
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,520
Why don't you sharpen it yourself?

569
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,960
But I don't use it as much as you do.

570
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,640
<i>Sairung was still so young.</i>

571
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,920
<i>I had no idea what to do back then.</i>

572
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Sairung, come out and play with us.

573
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,880
I have a doll here.

574
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,320
Sairung, come out and play with us.

575
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,560
<i>Losing her mother</i>
<i>affected Sairung's development.</i>

576
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,280
<i>The doctor said</i>
<i>she showed unusual symptoms,</i>

577
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,360
<i>similar to Dissociative Identity Disorder.</i>

578
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,760
<i>But not exactly that.</i>

579
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,240
<i>So I had to take care of her closely.</i>

580
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,440
<i>That's why I quit my job</i>
<i>and started this online news site.</i>

581
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,160
<i>Sairung started to smile again,</i>

582
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,320
<i>and that gave me hope that she might</i>
<i>return to who she was before.</i>

583
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,560
I already named this doll Muffin!

584
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,320
I picked the name before you did.

585
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,320
Just call it Woowoo instead.

586
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,360
- But the color is way more like a muffin.
<i>- I have to admit…</i>

587
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,960
<i>- Sairung is no longer the same person.</i>
- I want to be called Muffin.

588
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,600
<i>I tried every kind of treatment.</i>

589
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,920
<i>From conventional medicine</i>
<i>to all kinds of therapy,</i>

590
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,960
<i>I tried everything to help my daughter.</i>

591
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,280
<i>But none of it worked.</i>

592
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,040
Then I heard about you.

593
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,040
Me?

594
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,240
I'm not a doctor.

595
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,280
Have you heard this quote?

596
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,520
Mahatma Gandhi.

597
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,240
Or this one.

598
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,480
"The power of love and desire…"

599
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,880
"It has the power to make you do anything"

600
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,200
- "The power of…"
- Seriously?!

601
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,600
Those are lyrics from "Pong, Hin Lek Fai"!

602
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,440
Oh, you know this song?

603
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,480
- My mom used to play it.
- Great taste there.

604
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,440
There's also this line.

605
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,600
Stop it.

606
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,920
What exactly are you trying to say?

607
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,240
It's just like what Mahatma Gandhi
and Pong said.

608
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,000
Love has the greatest power.

609
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,680
It has the power to make you do anything.

610
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,360
- The power of--
- Hey!

611
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,920
Okay.

612
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,600
I believe that

613
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,560
if all five of Sairung's personalities

614
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,560
can experience the same kind of love,

615
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
her unusual condition

616
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,760
might actually go away.

617
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,800
Look…

618
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,240
I feel really sorry for you
for everything that happened.

619
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,080
But I stand by what I said.

620
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,920
I'm not capable of helping anyone.

621
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,960
What I do

622
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,640
only ends up hurting people.

623
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,680
You've seen that.

624
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,600
Anyway,

625
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,040
if I come across a doctor or someone
who can actually help you,

626
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,400
I'll let you know.

627
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,640
But for now, I have to go.

628
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,040
<i>He knows exactly what I like.</i>

629
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,560
<i>The type I'm weak for.</i>

630
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,000
<i>Feels like he was made to be</i>
<i>my perfect match.</i>

631
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,120
<i>Makes me fall in just a few days.</i>

632
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,520
This is not a request,

633
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,880
but an order.

634
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,040
That's the love karma!

635
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,600
These are the five girls that we must do
whatever it takes to make fall for me.

636
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,760
What's the name of the last one?

637
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,080
My name is Marnmok.

638
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,120
Marnmok seems like
the hardest one to approach.

639
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,440
My name is Sun.

640
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,240
Just focus on your work.

641
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,000
You don't have to try to get to know me.

642
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,680
It's the final boss.

643
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,640
Let's see who's got the most power.

644
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,960
Prai-Fon, Storm…

645
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,960
Sairung and Marnmok had a huge fight.

646
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
They decided to live separately.

647
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,080
Where are the other girls now?

648
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,320
We each have our own personal space.
