1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,040
<i>Who are you,</i>
<i>and what did you do with my mom?</i>

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm still your mom.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,880
Just an upgraded version, that's all.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,200
Sun.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,800
But now I know

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,720
pure love does exist.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,160
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,400
Tell me honestly.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,080
Did she have an affair?

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,200
Who was it with? Tell me.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,840
Who on earth told you all this?

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,640
Did your wife really kill herself,
Boss Thep?

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,920
Yes! But that's only partly true.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,240
<i>That big fight between you and Mom</i>
<i>before she died…</i>

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,720
What was it really about?

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,000
What about the affair?
What was that really about?

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,640
An affair?

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,400
She got hold of evidence

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,880
that she wasn't supposed to see.

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,160
What evidence?

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,880
- Please, sweetie. Stay out of it.
- Where's the evidence?

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,120
- Stop being a coward, boss!
- I burned it all!

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,960
Did you find anything?

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
"O"?

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,400
On-Anong.

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,720
This is it.
This is the next lead in our search.

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
I need your help.

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
I want you to hit on a woman.

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm truly sorry

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
for everything I did to you.

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,320
Then make it up to me by helping me.

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,480
If you help,

33
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,760
I will…

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,040
talk to you.

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,240
Bro, it's time for you to get to work.

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,480
That's On-Anong's location in real time.

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,520
How about we go there now?

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,360
You wait here. I'm going there with Sun.

39
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,000
Leave the risky task to me.

40
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,160
Bro.

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,120
I've turned it on. Do you see anything?

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,240
It's crystal clear, bro.

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,880
A true con artist, no doubt.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,480
The cam you tried that night?

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Do you want to see the footage
from that night too?

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Not funny, you little rascal.

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Focus on your duty.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,720
<i>We're going in now.</i>

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,760
Go ahead, bro.

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,040
Hey.

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you really serious
about Sairung and the other girls?

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Sairung and I were into each other,

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,040
but I was too young back then.

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,680
I couldn't really adapt to
the way they were.

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Now, I understand the world better.

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,160
I believe I can get along well
with Sairung and the other four girls.

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,880
Also,

59
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,680
Boss Theppachai said
love can heal Sairung.

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,480
I want to be the one who heals her.

61
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,440
<i>You should be glad, right,</i>

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,200
if Sairung gets better?

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you jealous?

64
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
You couldn't be.

65
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,800
Because you were paid to do that.

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,880
It's all right.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,680
Let me help you here.

68
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,200
Pat is not bad though.

69
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,560
There she is. On-Anong.

70
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,000
In the flesh.

71
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm too excited. I need a pee break.

72
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,440
Hey, sis.

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,840
Let's go.

74
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,800
Two beers, please.

75
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,600
So the rumor about her
being silenced isn't true.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,800
I can't guarantee
what I can extract from her.

77
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,840
<i>She was so close to Kritsana.</i>

78
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,760
She must know something.

79
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Just give it a try.

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,960
But how to approach her…

81
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
I'm back!

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,840
All right, sis.

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Thank you.

84
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,960
- Can we have a picture?
- Of course.

85
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,120
Come.

86
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

87
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,640
May I sing too?

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,280
After hearing that beautiful voice,

89
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,760
I hoped to hear one more song from her.

90
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,720
Would you sing one more with me?

91
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,720
Yuck.

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Marnmok, your jealousy's showing.

93
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,680
Slut!

94
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,520
What a slutty Sun.

95
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,840
Oh, it's Sairung.

96
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,840
Another one joining?

97
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,520
Relax, he's just doing his job.

98
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,480
Someone, get me out of here.

99
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,480
Mmm, perfect!

100
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,480
Thank you.

101
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,240
Want to sing one more?

102
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,799
I'm done with that moment.

103
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,480
I think we should move on to the next one.

104
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
I'm On.

105
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,400
On-Anong.

106
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,680
You're one seriously famous actress.

107
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,920
No introduction needed.

108
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,160
I'm Sun.

109
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
SUN: THE SUN

110
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,600
Like my son?

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,960
Just kidding.

112
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Am I too young?

113
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
For?

114
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,480
For getting to know you.

115
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,280
Am I too old

116
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,320
for us to get to know each other?

117
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,840
This place isn't fun anymore.

118
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
Let's go have fun somewhere else. Come on.

119
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,680
Only the devil moves this fast.

120
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,600
Genius. God's perfect score.
10, 10, 10, my bro Sun!

121
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,200
Um… where are we going?

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
My condo.

123
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,840
Where we can have more fun.

124
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,760
Does it really have to go this far?
It's pathetic.

125
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,440
Take it easy.

126
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,240
You're the one who sent him there, Marn.

127
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,240
She's right.

128
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,040
Here we are.

129
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,080
There's nothing
to be afraid of, little kid.

130
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,960
What are they up to now?

131
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Right now, they are about to…

132
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,600
do it!

133
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,080
Dig up. He's about to dig up information.

134
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,720
You brought me here.

135
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,760
I hope no one opens the door and walks in.

136
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,800
I'm single.

137
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,480
If you're really single,
you must be the Eighth Wonder.

138
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,120
What a sweet mouth you have.

139
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,920
I was in a relationship, yes.

140
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,640
But if it's not working,
what's the point in staying?

141
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,680
What about you?
Which number in the Wonders are you?

142
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,680
I'm just an amateur.

143
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,640
Anyway,

144
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,200
the relationship you were once in,

145
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,320
was it connected to the scandal
from back then?

146
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,600
You really are my biggest fan.

147
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,920
Give me a minute.

148
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,680
Don't go anywhere just yet.

149
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,440
Marnmok, what exactly
are you hoping to find?

150
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,800
I seriously don't know what to do next.

151
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,840
I want to know who leaked
the Kritsana Real Estate info,

152
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
or if she knows anything about Kritsana.

153
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,640
How am I supposed to dig that up? Digging
isn't my thing. I only know how to flirt.

154
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,320
Try searching her room.

155
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,600
Well, just try. Do whatever it takes.

156
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,880
Enough talking, kid.

157
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's do something else.

158
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,520
You're this hot.

159
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,360
I wonder who broke your heart.

160
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,960
No more talking.

161
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,960
Is he digging for info, or digging her?

162
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,160
I don't think this is working anymore.
Let's call it off.

163
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,520
Why call it off now? He's getting it now.

164
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,640
Getting what?
He's getting into her pants now.

165
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,960
We still haven't gotten any info.

166
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,480
If Sun can't find anything in this room,
he should try her bedroom, right?

167
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,840
I don't think this plan's working.

168
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,840
- Bring Sun back and we'll regroup.
- Take it easy.

169
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,040
Let's give him a bit more time.
He might find something.

170
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,800
No more talking.

171
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,680
You want to know about
Kritsana Real Estate, huh?

172
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,840
Hey.

173
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,000
I said,

174
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,000
do you want to know
about Kritsana Real Estate?

175
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,440
You know?

176
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,040
Hey.

177
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,080
She knows.

178
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,960
<i>I think we walked into her trap.</i>

179
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,040
Keep digging. You might get something.

180
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
I don't think it's working.

181
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,480
If she already knows, it might actually
make things easier for you.

182
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,360
What if it makes things
even more dangerous, Pat?

183
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,480
She's just one woman.
How could she be a threat?

184
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,640
Even Coach Chatch got taken out.
Sun stands no chance.

185
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,360
I have my own ways.

186
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,720
You don't need to worry.

187
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,520
<i>Sun.</i>

188
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,440
Sun.

189
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,560
Sun.

190
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,440
Damn!

191
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,840
We lost the signal.

192
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,040
What the hell's going on?

193
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,880
Can we fix it?

194
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,600
Hang on.

195
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
What the hell?

196
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
The battery in the camera
hasn't run out yet.

197
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,600
Looks like the signal got cut
from that side,

198
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,440
or Sun turned off the cam.

199
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,320
Or he was eliminated like Coach Chatch?

200
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Hey, sis. Are you out of your mind?
Watch what you say.

201
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,440
He got cut off like that.

202
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,120
He didn't answer the phone either.

203
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,960
Give me the location. I'm going there.

204
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,000
Have you lost your mind, Marnmok?
Why would you go there?

205
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,120
Sun!

206
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,040
I don't think this plan is working.

207
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,920
She seems to know she's being examined,

208
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
so I think I should step back for now.

209
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,400
But before I left, I found this.

210
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,720
I looked at it
and thought it might be useful,

211
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,920
so I took it with me.

212
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,920
But something feels off.

213
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,400
It's like she knows what we're after.

214
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,240
You took something
without asking the owner.

215
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,360
That's stealing.

216
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,480
ON

217
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,200
You're all handling this
like a bunch of kids.

218
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,440
If this were an actual job,

219
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,280
I'd call it a failure.

220
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,040
I'm sorry

221
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,480
for trying to play you.

222
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,640
Oh, his level has dropped.

223
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,320
I just came to tell you to stop.

224
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,040
You've got nothing on him.

225
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,480
You're trying to bring down Kritsana,
aren't you?

226
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,960
Do you have what it takes to do that?

227
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,080
A bunch of kids like you
against that powerful man?

228
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,600
Aren't you afraid of ending up dead?

229
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,560
My mother died because of this.
What more do I have to fear?

230
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,120
That folder. I prepared it for you.

231
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,480
RUMORS SWIRL
SECRET AFFAIR WITH TYCOON

232
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,800
Kritsana was my husband.

233
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,280
Well, not legally.

234
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,600
He already has a wife.

235
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,720
I was his mistress,
just like the news said.

236
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,200
But seriously, no drink for your guest?

237
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,040
ACTRESS "O" BECOMES
TYCOON'S SECRET MISTRESS.

238
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,800
Yes, it was me.

239
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,680
19 YEARS AGO

240
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,320
What are you trying to get
out of going public with that?

241
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,400
Why should I keep hiding?

242
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,920
Reporters keep asking me,

243
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,600
"Are you seeing someone?"
"Can you tell us who?"

244
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,040
How long do I have to keep avoiding them?

245
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,640
Do actresses really want to admit
they're mistresses?

246
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,200
What I gave you

247
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,600
is better than you being exposed.

248
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,320
- Be a little smarter.
- But I'm not just anyone.

249
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,080
I'm an actress.

250
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,120
I could've had anyone for a husband,

251
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,520
but I chose you and became your mistress.

252
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
Give me the right to stand in public.

253
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,720
But this kind of news
could damage my business.

254
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
You know that.

255
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,840
What about my career?

256
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,720
How much longer
do I have to live in the dark?

257
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,280
Okay.

258
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,480
Leave showbiz then

259
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,480
and live in the luxury I provide, quietly.

260
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,800
Are you crazy?

261
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,560
Every woman wants to be seen.

262
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,800
If you don't want people to know
what we are to each other,

263
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,720
this is what I'm going to do.

264
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,360
Okay.

265
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,920
I get your point, On.

266
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,880
If you're no longer an actress,
but only my mistress,

267
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,680
you'll be okay with that, right?

268
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,560
Fine.

269
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,480
I'm taking you out of the industry myself.

270
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Chatch, take care of that for me.

271
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,400
Come to think of it,

272
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,920
I shouldn't have chosen the shortcut
to a comfortable life like that.

273
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,440
If I could turn back time,

274
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,360
I would've chosen to stay single

275
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,360
instead of becoming someone's mistress.

276
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,400
He said he'd take you out of the industry.

277
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,160
What did he mean by that?

278
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,040
You came to see us here

279
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,840
because you want revenge
on Kritsana, right?

280
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,920
I already did that.

281
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
After I left the industry,

282
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
I pretended to be nice to him and waited
for the right time to get back at him.

283
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,800
Then I found out that the wealth
and fortune of Kritsana Real Estate

284
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,760
had a shady background.

285
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,440
MULTIPLE SOURCES REVEAL CORRUPTION

286
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,960
EXTENSIVE CONNECTIONS

287
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,880
CONDOS EVERYWHERE

288
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,600
So I secretly gathered all the evidence
and passed it to someone close.

289
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,880
"Journalist dies tragically."

290
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,440
"Car flips and bursts into flames."

291
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,000
Was that connected to my mother?

292
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,080
JOURNALIST DIES TRAGICALLY

293
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,680
"Pornnapa, a newspaper journalist,

294
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,560
took her own life
by overdosing on sleeping pills."

295
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,800
"Suspected cause: family issues
related to alleged affair."

296
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,560
<i>That was enough for me</i>
<i>to piece everything together.</i>

297
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,640
<i>My right-hand man</i>

298
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,280
gave my evidence
to a journalist named Pornnapa.

299
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,880
And I'm certain
they were both set up and taken out.

300
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,800
My mother really didn't take her own life.

301
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,040
Where's the evidence?

302
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,280
It was destroyed.

303
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,160
What about the news
saying it was an affair?

304
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,880
It was fake news.

305
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,800
Fake news?

306
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,440
Shit. Who was behind it?

307
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,000
The one who wrote it was the reporter.

308
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,280
But the one who twisted the story?

309
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,840
Who else do you think it could be?

310
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,600
The news came out from <i>Truth Today.</i>

311
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,280
The person who released the story

312
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,400
about my mother having an affair
and overdosing…

313
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,440
Shit.

314
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,520
…was my father?

315
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,200
It was Theppachai who started it all.

316
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,440
He wanted to produce a scoop
exposing Kritsana,

317
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,400
but when the pressure from his company
got too intense, he started backing off.

318
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
So that's why your father
didn't want us digging into this.

319
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,680
You remember me, right, Mrs. On-Anong?

320
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,440
Who is this?

321
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,560
<i>We met…</i>

322
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,800
while I was trying to expose
Kritsana Real Estate.

323
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,880
WANG NON
FRIENDS

324
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,560
I'm staying out of this. I won't let
anything happen to my daughter.

325
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,480
You leave us alone.

326
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,840
<i>Theppachai…</i>

327
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,480
the husband of that journalist, Pornnapa?

328
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,440
I wanted to tell you it's not over yet.

329
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,160
I want you to help put an end to it
if someone's looking for you.

330
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,320
Looking for me?

331
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,440
Who's looking for me?

332
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,200
My daughter.

333
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,200
She's trying to dig up this case.

334
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,640
How would I know
which one is your daughter?

335
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,280
<i>I'll send you her photo,</i>
<i>along with everyone involved.</i>

336
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,680
<i>I need your help.</i>

337
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,880
You know very well what your husband
will do if my daughter digs too deep.

338
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,480
You were a coward then.

339
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,040
You're still a coward now.

340
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,440
You've never lost someone
the way I lost my wife.

341
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,880
You--

342
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,240
Mrs. On-Anong. Hello?

343
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,560
Damn it!

344
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,480
But that bar we met at…

345
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,640
It didn't seem like the kind of place
someone like you would go.

346
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,440
And what if I said it was purely
a coincidence that I met you two?

347
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,960
It was just a coincidence.

348
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,760
One night, I was lonely.

349
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,880
I walked up to a rooftop bar.

350
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,520
But what I saw,
which was better than the view,

351
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,800
was a man and a woman flirting.

352
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,800
<i>A coincidence</i>
<i>inside a coincidence does exist.</i>

353
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,360
These documents are the same ones
my mom had, Pat.

354
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,920
You have them too?

355
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,480
I found them at my old house,
in my mother's room.

356
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,840
We can hand these over to the police.
That should put an end to everything.

357
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,800
There are plenty of documents like these.

358
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,480
Pornnapa got some.

359
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,240
Some came from me.

360
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,880
Kritsana has been doing business
this way for decades

361
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,480
before his company got this big.

362
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,080
That means he has
plenty of skeletons in the closet.

363
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,240
Marn, I know some journalists
who could expose this.

364
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,240
Want me to contact them?

365
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
Do you really think
a few paper documents are enough?

366
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,560
How much would be enough?

367
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,000
That's your job.

368
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,760
I tried and I failed.

369
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,040
When I found out someone else
was still going after this,

370
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
I wanted to help.

371
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,440
Because no matter what, I still want to
see Kritsana Real Estate go down.

372
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,800
As for you,

373
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,680
you don't want your mother's death
to be for nothing, right?

374
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,400
I'll be waiting for your update.

375
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,920
REAL ESTATE MOGUL CAUGHT
IN SECRET AFFAIR WITH EX-ACTRESS

376
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Why is everything such a mess?

377
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,760
We started by flirting with a woman
who had five personalities.

378
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,960
How did we end up dealing with
a real estate mogul?

379
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,800
It's totally unrelated.

380
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,040
True.

381
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,840
Are we really going to continue with this?

382
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,040
From what she told us,

383
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,200
we could be in serious danger.

384
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,840
Hey.

385
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,040
Hey!

386
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,720
I'm taking this evidence to my father.

387
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,000
Pat, you're coming with me.

388
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,800
Enjoying your beer, boss?

389
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,520
Great. We can sit down and talk.

390
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,000
About what?

391
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,760
About the bullshit you pulled.

392
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,800
Pat, you're drunk. Go to bed.

393
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,360
Come on, bro.

394
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,600
Talk to me first.

395
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,440
I was out helping your daughter today.

396
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,320
It was tiring as hell.

397
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,120
Oh, right.

398
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,480
You already knew

399
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,680
'cause you had your little chat
with that woman, On-Anong.

400
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,960
You're a real piece of shit,
you know that?

401
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,120
What kind of garbage journalist
covers up the truth?

402
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,040
That's just how things--

403
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,720
Not only did you cover it up, but you even
had the balls to spread fake news.

404
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,440
What fake news?

405
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,560
And the fake news
was about your own damn wife!

406
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,600
Calm down, Pat.

407
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,760
I think you're too drunk.

408
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,920
Go sleep it off. When you're--

409
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,280
Calling you a garbage journalist

410
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,440
is not enough.

411
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,520
You piece of shit!

412
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,840
What's that?

413
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,200
What's going on?

414
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,360
This bastard's the one
who spread the fake news!

415
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,800
Calm down.

416
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,120
"Calm down"?

417
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,560
It was his goddamn fake news
that screwed up people's lives.

418
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,440
What crap are you talking about?
What fake news?

419
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,960
"Pornnapa,

420
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,120
a newspaper journalist,

421
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,760
took her own life by overdosing."

422
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,600
"Suspected cause."

423
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,280
"Family issues related to alleged affair."

424
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,720
What does that have to do with you?

425
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,960
That alleged affair was with my father!

426
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,600
My father had an affair
with your damn wife,

427
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,200
and he was taken out
because of your damn wife!

428
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,760
Your father was the lead

429
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,240
who got the evidence from On-Anong?

430
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,680
I've been following you

431
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,000
since everything went down.

432
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,840
MISS ATHITIYA PAKDEETRAKUL

433
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,800
<i>I remembered that last name vividly.</i>

434
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,800
MEDIA WORLD SHOCKED: PORNNAPA
PAKDEETRAKUL TOOK OWN LIFE…

435
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,080
<i>I never thought I'd cross paths</i>
<i>with Sairung so easily.</i>

436
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,320
Once you graduate,
what kind of job do you plan to do?

437
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,560
Whatever Sairung does, I'll do that too.

438
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,680
<i>How perfect.</i>
<i>Sairung led me straight to you.</i>

439
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,480
You tore my family apart.

440
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,880
But your dad was taken out
because he messed with those people.

441
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,880
- Did you know that?
- It wasn't just that.

442
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,040
You lost your father, and I lost my wife.

443
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,400
Didn't we suffer the same?
What else do you want from me?

444
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,600
But you released that twisted story,

445
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,720
and people believed the wrong thing.

446
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,480
Especially my mother!

447
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,000
You're a goddamn coward

448
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,960
for not having the guts
to report the truth.

449
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,000
And what the hell
did you expect me to write?

450
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,960
"Pornnapa found secret evidence
and got murdered in a staged suicide"?

451
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,720
You expected me to write that?

452
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,360
You think if I'd written that,
Sairung and I would still be alive today?

453
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,000
It was because of that damn affair news

454
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,600
that my mom was heartbroken
and got depressed.

455
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,520
And she died in an accident, you bastard.

456
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,000
See?

457
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,679
I was left all alone
because of your fucking fake news.

458
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,080
I might not have reported the whole truth,

459
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
but the affair wasn't fake news.

460
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,920
Your damn father really did have
an affair with my wife!

461
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,600
I don't believe that.

462
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,239
Marn,

463
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,400
what your mother did,
do you think it didn't hurt me too?

464
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,560
You think everyone else suffered,
but I didn't?

465
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,360
I hurt just as much as anyone else did.

466
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,320
Then why did my family have to be
the one that shattered?

467
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,440
Was it this fucking hand that wrote
the fake news that ruined my life?

468
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Pat!

469
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,080
Get a grip. Come on.

470
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,600
Everyone here has been affected by this.

471
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,360
Think it through.

472
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,880
Where did all this really begin?

473
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,000
Calm down, Pat.

474
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,480
What was the root cause of all this?

475
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,680
Shouldn't we fix it from there?

476
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,080
Let's not let a mistake

477
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,240
turn into more mistakes.

478
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,200
Let's make it right

479
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,360
the right way, Pat.

480
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,480
Pat and I are also victims in this,
and so are you.

481
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,480
Even if we stay silent and safe,

482
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,600
we'll have to live with the doubt
for the rest of our lives, Dad.

483
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
<i>Check the news now, bro.</i>

484
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,680
How do you feel about Sun?

485
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,200
Dad!

486
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,720
No matter what method it takes
to help you heal, I'm ready to try it.

487
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,440
I think she's doing better now.

488
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,000
Only Marnmok is left.

489
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,760
I'm here to tell you all
that I'm going to quit.

490
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,400
It's time. You have to choose…

491
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,920
the one you love the most.
