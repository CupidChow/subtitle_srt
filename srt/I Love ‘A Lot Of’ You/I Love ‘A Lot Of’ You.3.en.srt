1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,160
These are the five girls we must do
whatever it takes to make fall for me.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,600
What's the name of the last one?

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,760
My name is Marnmok.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,960
Are you crazy? You're telling me
the interview footage is gone?

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,120
Is it really losing the footage you're
upset about, or losing to him?

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,280
<i>Marnmok's listening to heavy stuff again.</i>

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,480
Does she switch her personality
at midnight?

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,600
We each have our own personal spaces.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,200
<i>Being in the light</i>
<i>means coming out to live.</i>

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,200
<i>The five of us take turns</i>
<i>spending time in the light each day.</i>

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,720
Sairung, why can't you understand?

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,680
But with two out of the five
not getting along like this,

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,240
you think they'll cooperate with me?

14
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,960
"DEBUT…'S HERE" TYPING

15
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,560
<i>Aren't these books available online now?</i>
<i>Why'd she have to come to the library?</i>

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,640
<i>Because she's Prai-Fon.</i>

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,920
<i>She's a real bookworm.</i>
<i>She loves doing research.</i>

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,360
<i>The feeling of turning physical pages</i>
<i>is totally different from reading online.</i>

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,720
<i>Isn't it nice that</i>
<i>she goes to the library?</i>

20
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,840
<i>You can sneak a peek</i>
<i>at what she's reading.</i>

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,680
<i>That way, I'll know what she's into too.</i>

22
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,680
Gosh.

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Got it. She took this one.

24
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,480
Hold on.

25
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
How do I know which book she took?

26
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,880
Damn it.

27
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
Shit!

28
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,840
I could report you for stalking.

29
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,080
Wanna confess now or wait for your lawyer?

30
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,440
I don't have a lawyer.

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,080
And I wasn't stalking.

32
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Sun sent me here to work.

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,720
FYI, following someone, or stalking,

34
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,480
is the act of following or monitoring
someone over a period of time.

35
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,400
It's considered illegal behavior.

36
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,000
There are two types.

37
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,640
Physical stalking

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,720
and online stalking,
which is called cyberstalking.

39
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm just doing my job.

40
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,480
My paycheck is on the line.

41
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,080
Please don't send me to jail.

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm only here to do my job.

43
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,640
Sun just wants to know
what you're researching,

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,880
so he can help you the best he can.

45
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,080
We both want to do our best
in this line of work

46
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,360
Anything that can help get more
information, we'll do it all.

47
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,280
We just really want it to turn out great.

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,160
Okay. It's great that
you're committed to your job.

49
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
You want to know, right?

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,080
Here.

51
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,880
Whoa, there's a lot.

52
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,240
Enjoy reading them all.

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,720
FIRE AT NIGHT, LADY'S HILL,
SEX EXPERIENCE

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,680
<i>Sex Experience?</i>

55
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,280
Is this what's she into?

56
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,520
What's up with her?

57
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,040
<i>Prai-Fon could be like</i>
<i>a hot-nerd type of girl.</i>

58
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,840
Cut it out.

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,320
<i>What are you up to?</i>

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
<i>Got nothing to do?</i>

61
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,160
<i>Then why'd you send me here?</i>

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm shaking off some rust.

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,000
Gotta get ready for tomorrow.

64
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,120
Hanging up now.

65
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Hi.

66
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
- I've already booked.
- Sign here, sir.

67
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

68
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,280
I've never seen you here before.

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,760
Well, my workplace has changed,

70
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,600
so changing gyms…

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,120
that's not strange, right?

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
Will you be okay

73
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,360
if I want you in the ring with me?

74
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,000
As my practice partner.

75
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,920
I've trained in boxing before.

76
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,760
If you need a partner, I'm happy to help.

77
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,600
But where's your usual one?

78
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,400
Having five days of rest.

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,400
What kind of boxer takes five days off?
He's gonna lose his form.

80
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,600
He's not on leave.

81
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,280
He's in the hospital.

82
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,040
I knocked him out.

83
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,880
If it's too much for you, let me know.

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,560
I'd rather not send two people
to the hospital in the same week.

85
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,480
Sure.

86
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,160
But if it's too much for you, you tell me.

87
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
I don't want to send you to be next
to your old practice partner either.

88
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,440
She's really an Avenger.

89
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,640
Is there anything you can't do?

90
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,400
Are you really that into boxing,
going all in like this?

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,280
Don't change the subject.

92
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,680
If you can't handle it, just say so.
We can stop right here.

93
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,200
No, it's not that.

94
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,600
Here's the deal.

95
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,560
If I land a hit on you, you have to
answer my question. Deal?

96
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,880
Land the hit first, then suggest deals.

97
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Guess I shouldn't hold back anymore.

98
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,600
Hey.

99
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,240
If you want to back out, now's the time.

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,280
So you really love boxing that much?

101
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,560
You chose here to learn.

102
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
There's a mentor here
I want to learn from.

103
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,040
Why'd you cheat?

104
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,200
A guy shouldn't be boxing
with a girl to begin with.

105
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,400
Who's the real cheat, exactly?

106
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,880
Where'd you learn to dodge like that?

107
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,240
- You've learned boxing before?
- Yeah, I used to.

108
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,040
But yesterday I saw a clip of
a pro boxer dodging punches like that,

109
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,960
so I tried it out.

110
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,080
And you pulled it off
just from watching a clip?

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
Show-off.

112
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,320
That mentor you mentioned…

113
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,360
Why do you want to learn from him?
Is he that good?

114
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,960
Actually, I don't really want
to learn from him.

115
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,720
I want to talk to him more.

116
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,400
Hey, De.

117
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,360
I hit a tough one yesterday.

118
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,720
Let's catch up in the meeting room.

119
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,360
Okay.

120
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,680
- Let's go.
- Okay. Go, go.

121
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,160
Just go to hell together.

122
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,120
Take it easy there.

123
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Sorry.

124
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,240
I let my feelings take over a bit.

125
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,760
Why?

126
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,440
Did you and Sun have a fight?

127
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
No,

128
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,560
not a fight.

129
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,960
Just teasing.

130
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,680
Adds a little spice to the office, right?

131
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,160
With a new colleague?

132
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,200
You two got close quite fast.

133
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,440
Did you know him before?

134
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,200
No.

135
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I just met him
when our boss recruited him.

136
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,760
My job's all about coordination, right?

137
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,360
How could I not get close to people fast?

138
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,240
If I couldn't,
then I couldn't do this work.

139
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,600
Sun has to work directly with Sairung,

140
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,000
and our boss is worried
about his daughter.

141
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
So I've been following up with him a lot.

142
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,560
Sairung is a bit difficult to work with.
Can he really handle it?

143
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,760
You used to be close to her
for a while, right?

144
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,400
Not gonna give him any advice?

145
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,320
I'd rather watch from afar.

146
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,520
Boxing? Seriously?

147
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
Whoa.

148
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,920
How far is each personality gonna go?

149
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,680
Picture this.

150
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,040
The other day, I was a fanboy.
Yesterday, I went boxing.

151
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,480
I had to deal with the serious girl
and then the walking encyclopedia girl.

152
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,680
It's drained me more than
my whole career combined.

153
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,680
If all five of them were real people,
they'd probably take over the world.

154
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,080
So what's the plan?

155
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,480
It's been almost two weeks
and there's no progress.

156
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Look at you. It's more like you're just
collecting theme park points.

157
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,400
If Boss Thep gets upset and exposes
both of us, what do we do?

158
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,400
Going there now?

159
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,440
Okay, see you.

160
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,640
It's not all just a game, you know.

161
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
A lot of what I did,

162
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,120
I low-key enjoyed them for real.

163
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,160
Despite how different each of them is,

164
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,600
I think they must share
at least one thing.

165
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,120
I just have to figure it out.

166
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,000
You just said that to sound cool.

167
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,640
You're into girls, admit it.

168
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,760
Hey!

169
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,520
Bro.

170
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,480
LIGHT AND SHADOW GALLERY

171
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,440
Hey, Sun, my dear bro.

172
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,080
It's been a while, huh?

173
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,200
You got in no problem, right?

174
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,800
No problem at all.

175
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
I just said I was your guest
and they let me in.

176
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,880
So, your target's here?

177
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,520
We discussed this before, right?
No talking about that here.

178
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,560
Okay, my apologies.

179
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,120
Just enjoy the party then.

180
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,200
Whoa.

181
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,560
I'd go after someone that pretty
even without getting paid.

182
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
All right, I'll excuse myself now.
Have fun.

183
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,120
In less than two hours, you transformed
from your office look into this.

184
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,560
May I call that your special talent?

185
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,200
You are something too.

186
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,760
In less than an hour,

187
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,040
finding a nice suit isn't hard.

188
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,360
But knowing where I'd be
and following me here…

189
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,920
That's a talent of yours too.

190
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,720
Don't forget that I'm a photographer.

191
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,640
Being at a place like this
isn't that strange.

192
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,720
It doesn't mean I'm following you.

193
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,440
All right, all right.

194
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,680
You weren't following me. Got it.

195
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,880
Because tonight, I've got
someone else to focus on anyway.

196
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,560
Oh, you're that artist.

197
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Me?

198
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
That happening art you created.

199
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,800
I have to say,
you're quite the artist yourself.

200
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm Joe.

201
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,760
And what you're seeing here…

202
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,360
is all my work.

203
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,360
Well, it's because of you

204
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,760
that I'm here.

205
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,480
Someone who can capture
a woman's emotions so deeply

206
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,160
makes me curious.

207
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,520
What kind of charm
does a person like that have,

208
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,560
to make women open up so easily?

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,680
A journalist? I thought you were
a model or something.

210
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,160
I was just about to ask you
to be my next model.

211
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,680
A journalist can model too.

212
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,840
You probably ask every woman you meet
to be one of your models, don't you?

213
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,520
No.

214
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,360
I only invite

215
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,760
the ones I like.

216
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,080
I also like…

217
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,360
these photos.

218
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,240
Let me take you through my other pieces

219
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,960
You're usually so busy.

220
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,200
Do you still have time for photography?

221
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,280
If it's something you love,

222
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,520
you always find time for it.

223
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,560
I've loved beautiful things
since I was a kid.

224
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,280
These "beautiful things" you love…

225
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,200
Do you just like taking pictures of them?

226
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,880
Is there something I can do for you?

227
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,240
I've just got
quite a deep question for you.

228
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
I want to know

229
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,800
if you can give me an answer as detailed
as the ones you gave Ms. Sairung.

230
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,880
Of course.

231
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,920
I've heard stories

232
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,200
about some people in high society
who do photography.

233
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,880
On the surface,
it's all just normal photo shoots.

234
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,680
But behind the scenes,

235
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,720
some models are taken advantage of.

236
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,079
Then they're silenced
with money and influence,

237
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,599
so they don't dare speak out.

238
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Have you ever heard anything like that?

239
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,720
The way you put it makes it sound like
I'm being lumped in with that lot.

240
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,080
People label me as some rich guy
who loves photography.

241
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,720
I haven't mentioned your name yet.

242
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm just curious about whether,
if you came across something like this,

243
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,080
you would speak up?

244
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,000
Honestly, things like this
exist in every industry.

245
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
People come from all kinds of backgrounds.

246
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,520
You can see someone's face,
but not their true intentions.

247
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,000
As for me,

248
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,440
I believe those kinds of people
tarnish art.

249
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
But even if I saw them in person,

250
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,160
I wouldn't go up to them
and call them out directly.

251
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,640
That would be just as rude.

252
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
That's a really interesting point.

253
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,680
If we get a chance,

254
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,680
maybe we can do a deep interview sometime.

255
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,920
Most people only ask me about business.

256
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
Talking about something personal
sounds great.

257
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,560
Actually, after this event,

258
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,480
I've got some free time.

259
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,400
If you don't mind,

260
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,000
how about we find a quiet place
to talk, Sairung?

261
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,840
Too bad, that's not happening tonight.

262
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,440
But you already know

263
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,920
where to reach me.

264
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,080
Please excuse me.

265
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,880
What the hell did I just do?

266
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,280
Hey, photographer.

267
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,400
Can you please walk a little slower?

268
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,640
Didn't you have a deep interview to do,
Ms. Sairung, who's into deep stuff?

269
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,920
Come on.
You're acting like you're jealous.

270
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,280
We're nothing to each other.

271
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,040
I know we are not a thing.

272
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,040
But I didn't like
how he talked to you back there.

273
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,280
He seemed shady.

274
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
I could tell.

275
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm glad you could tell.

276
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,760
And remember not to act like that
with anyone.

277
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,280
Hey, I'm kidding.

278
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,960
I went along with him tonight
because he's a source.

279
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,840
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come here
in the first place,

280
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,400
and that whole incident when we first met
wouldn't have happened either.

281
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,520
Wow.

282
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,240
You really plan things step by step.

283
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,960
You're kinda scary.

284
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,560
But at least,

285
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,880
he's the reason we met.

286
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,400
That's not romantic at all.

287
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,280
Why not blame it on…
destiny or something?

288
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,160
Do you want to go grab a drink together?

289
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
What's wrong?

290
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,680
Actually, I'm here for work.

291
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,680
Let's meet again some other time.

292
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,960
Where are you going?

293
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,600
What's up?

294
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
An old case.

295
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,840
Who?

296
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,960
I've gotta run.

297
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
You've got a lot of old cases.

298
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Excuse me.

299
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,400
That man you were talking to earlier,

300
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,680
where is he now?

301
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,880
He had something to take care of.

302
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Thank you.

303
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,120
LIGHT AND SHADOW GALLERY

304
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,640
One cocktail, please.

305
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,440
You're still here?
I thought you were in a rush.

306
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,320
I had something urgent to do earlier,

307
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,440
but it's done now.

308
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,520
So now you're free?

309
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,120
Yes.

310
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,440
But I've only got time for one drink.

311
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,400
It's just…

312
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,640
I'm not really in the mood
for fun right now.

313
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,680
Do you want me to help bring the fun back?

314
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,760
Try this one instead.

315
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,960
I had it made just for you.

316
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,080
I think my guests
would love something strong.

317
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
At a party,

318
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,160
if you've got a good drink

319
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,120
and a beautiful woman,

320
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,000
it's always a good time, right?

321
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,280
Bottoms up.

322
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,000
Sit down a bit if you start feeling dizzy.

323
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
Once you can handle it,

324
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,720
things will get more fun.

325
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,920
No, I'm good.

326
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,960
I really set a time limit for myself.

327
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,200
I don't go back on my word.

328
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,440
What was that drink? It's insanely strong.

329
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,200
Damn, I'm drunk.

330
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,720
Hello, De. What's up?

331
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Just now I was worried the audio from
the pen recorder might be lost,

332
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,840
so I went in to try backing up the files…

333
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,400
Can you get to the point?
I'm running from an old case right now.

334
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,880
In the real-time sound, I heard Sairung
keep mumbling that she's drunk.

335
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,720
I don't know what's going on with her.

336
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,320
Hello, De.

337
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,960
<i>I can't get hold of Sairung.</i>

338
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,760
<i>Do you hear anything else from the pen?</i>

339
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,080
Right now, it's quiet.

340
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,400
I'm not hearing anything.

341
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,200
Let me try listening again.

342
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,160
Bro, I'm not hearing anything.
It's gone quiet again.

343
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,040
<i>Have you searched for her everywhere?</i>

344
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,200
<i>The real-time audio file's still active,</i>
<i>but there's no sound.</i>

345
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,520
I've looked everywhere.

346
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,040
What's going on, De?
Is everything all right?

347
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,320
It's Ms. Sairung.

348
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,880
She said she was really drunk.
She isn't picking up our calls.

349
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm trying to listen
to the pen's audio now

350
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,680
to figure out where she might be
or find clues that could lead us to her.

351
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,880
It sounds pretty echoey.

352
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,080
There's a loud noise.

353
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,000
<i>And some wind.</i>

354
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,720
And water flushing.

355
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,880
Women's room?

356
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,800
Okay, I'll go check there.

357
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,360
WOONSEN - 03/2025

358
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,760
Long time no see.

359
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,120
Have you been doing well, Sun?

360
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,920
What's the rush?

361
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,040
Aren't you gonna ask back how I've been?

362
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,880
You disappeared from my life
just like that,

363
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,560
and I managed to move on…

364
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,400
until now…

365
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,520
when I saw you again.

366
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
I wish I could slap the anger out of me.

367
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,320
I'm truly sorry.

368
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,320
I'm really in a rush.

369
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,040
Please excuse me.

370
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,720
Sorry. My friend
is probably not feeling well

371
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,960
and is staying in here.

372
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
Hey.

373
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,080
Hey!

374
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,760
Sairung, you okay there?

375
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,680
I thought you'd run off and left me.

376
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,320
I'm sorry.

377
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,240
I won't run from anyone again.

378
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,960
Let's go.

379
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,520
Next time, if I'm not with you,
don't drink like this again.

380
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,640
It's not safe.

381
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,480
That lady went to the women's room.

382
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,560
When I went to get her,
someone was already taking her out.

383
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,040
Never mind.

384
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,240
I have her name card.

385
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,000
I'll manage this later.

386
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,800
Good evening, Mr. Joe.

387
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,840
Oh, hi, Uncle Chatch.

388
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,600
What brings you here?

389
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,600
I just came by to say hello,

390
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,480
and to thank you, especially your father.

391
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,840
Can you tell him I'm truly grateful?

392
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,920
No need to, really.

393
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
You worked for me and my dad.

394
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,200
Of course we'd take care of you.

395
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,800
So, what are you up to these days?

396
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,640
I've got a job now.

397
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,640
I'm working as a boxing coach at a gym.

398
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,760
Where are you taking me?

399
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,320
No idea yet.

400
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,960
Just driving around.

401
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
If you go home like this,

402
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,960
your father might freak out.

403
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,560
SHE'S SAFE NOW.

404
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
What the heck?!

405
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,440
Hey, you scared the hell out of me!

406
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Overreacting.

407
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,480
Aren't you going home?

408
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,680
Sun texted me. She's safe now.

409
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,320
How could I leave?
I haven't cleared this up with you yet.

410
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,840
Why did you have that?

411
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,000
Have what?

412
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,280
That voice recorder pen!

413
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,240
Why did you have it?

414
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,360
Come on, sis.

415
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,040
Anyone can get a voice recorder pen.

416
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,160
A few clicks on a shopping app
and it's at your door.

417
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,360
But you gave it to Sairung to carry.

418
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,600
That's a violation of her privacy.

419
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,440
Come on, sis.

420
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,720
I'm dealing with five personalities here.

421
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,480
Whatever helps,

422
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,560
let me use it.

423
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,400
Without my pen,

424
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,040
who knows what might have
happened to her by now?

425
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,680
Let me hear it.

426
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,280
All right, put them on.

427
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,520
I'll turn the voice on.

428
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,480
This is a real-time voice recording.

429
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,400
<i>Hey, go slowly there.</i>

430
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,440
<i>Take it slow.</i>

431
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
<i>Come on. I can handle it.</i>

432
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,520
<i>Feel better now?</i>

433
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,680
<i>Let's go slowly.</i>

434
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
There's static.

435
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,440
I can't hear anything.

436
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,600
Turn it off and go home.

437
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,800
I'm closing up the office.

438
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,200
Go! Hurry.

439
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,880
What?

440
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,840
Static?

441
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,720
- I said turn it off!
- Got it.

442
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,680
All off.

443
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,480
Slowly. We're home.

444
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,960
Oh, take it easy.

445
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,080
You taking me to your room?

446
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,960
Just lie down here.

447
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
I'll be with you in a minute. Careful.

448
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,640
Hey, easy there.

449
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,240
Are you okay?

450
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,440
Do you know what you're doing right now?

451
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,120
I know exactly what I'm doing.

452
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,000
I just can't really stand up straight.

453
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,680
Then lie back down.

454
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
What's the rush?

455
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,000
I want to pee.

456
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,200
Walk slowly.

457
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,480
Hey, no!

458
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,160
Wait for me to step out first.

459
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,320
Oh, I forgot.

460
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,880
Can you just turn around then?

461
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,880
What?

462
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,840
Does this happen to you a lot?

463
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,560
This is the first time.

464
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,760
I've never been drunk to the point that
I couldn't control myself like this.

465
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,920
I figured.

466
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,760
You don't seem the type to get so wasted
you can't take care of yourself like this.

467
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,680
What type do I seem like, then?

468
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,920
Well…

469
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,320
Confident,

470
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,560
smart,

471
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,040
and someone who stands on her own.

472
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,000
But apparently, not right now.

473
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,960
Help me.

474
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,760
Help me, please.

475
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,560
What else?

476
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,000
What else what?

477
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,520
What else do I seem like?

478
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,840
Cute.

479
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,360
SORRY, NO SIGNAL.
PEN BATTERY MIGHT BE DEAD.

480
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,520
Still working?

481
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,720
Just my freelance photography.

482
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,160
Mr. Joe texted me. He didn't see me leave.

483
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,320
So you have each other's contact details.

484
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,200
He probably got
my contact details from someone.

485
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,560
You don't sound too happy.

486
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,240
I was just thinking…

487
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,600
if I hadn't gone back in to get you,

488
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,240
would you have left with him?

489
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,560
Did you want me to go with him?

490
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,600
Who did you want to go with?

491
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,520
Whose room am I in right now?

492
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,520
Did you take these photos yourself?

493
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,680
Yes.

494
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,640
Beautiful?

495
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,440
Yes.

496
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,160
But it would be more beautiful
if it were in the photo.

497
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,000
Shouldn't you let someone else say that?

498
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,960
Why wait?

499
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,440
You can always compliment yourself.

500
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,120
No need.

501
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Let me do it.

502
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,600
You're beautiful.

503
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,080
Way more beautiful than
any photo I have taken.

504
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,480
Do you have more photos?

505
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,720
I want to see them.

506
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,560
Wow.

507
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,920
You could have your own
photography exhibition.

508
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
You're exaggerating.
I just take pictures for fun.

509
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,240
I'm not exaggerating.

510
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,800
Your photos are genuinely beautiful.

511
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,560
They're good enough to be in a gallery.
No need to be so modest.

512
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,360
Seeing them makes me
want to interview you.

513
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,400
Everyone, we are now with Mr. Sun,

514
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,960
the famous photographer
behind these stunning images.

515
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,400
Mr. Sun, what's the difference

516
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,120
between photographing people
and photographing landscapes?

517
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,040
There's definitely a difference.

518
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,800
With landscapes,
they're already beautiful on their own.

519
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,640
I just find an angle I think is beautiful,

520
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,200
one that can tell a story.

521
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,880
With people,

522
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,800
even if I'm photographing the same person,

523
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,320
no two shots are ever the same.

524
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,600
Because their personality,

525
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,680
mood,

526
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,440
the look in their eyes,

527
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,760
and their posture

528
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,560
change every second.

529
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
And it's up to me

530
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,560
to decide when to snap the shot

531
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,640
and capture the feeling.

532
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,600
Ooh,

533
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,360
this model looks kind of familiar.

534
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,200
Well,

535
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,240
that was the first day we met.

536
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,680
This is the first time

537
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,880
I've seen a candid photo
of myself like this.

538
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,080
Let's take a photo.

539
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,600
You want me to take a photo of you?

540
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,400
No.

541
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,200
Us together.

542
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,200
Let's take a photo.

543
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,000
One, two, three.

544
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,160
How did I get here?

545
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,040
Marnmok?

546
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,760
Yes.

547
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,920
How did I get here?

548
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,960
Take it easy.

549
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,160
Don't follow me.

550
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,440
I don't think this plan will work.

551
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,160
How do you see this ending?

552
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,440
I don't know.

553
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,080
Why did Sun take on this kind of job?

554
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,560
Sun!

555
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,960
No one has ever done
something like this for me.

556
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,080
Thank you so much.

557
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,480
I have no idea either, but I have
a feeling it's gonna be a good ending.

558
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,400
Sun…

559
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,080
Are you in love?
