1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,560
How did I get here?

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,480
<i>I don't know what you're up to,</i>

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,520
but I think I've figured you out.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,480
And what does this have to do with you?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,720
<i>I met Sariung in college.</i>

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,360
<i>We started dating.</i>

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,600
Sairung.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,760
Sairung?

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,640
Sairung!

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,920
But I admit it.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,920
I couldn't love all of her personalities.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,520
Somebody help. We're stuck in here.

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,520
Hello!

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,720
Sometimes, life doesn't give you
many choices.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,560
<i>There are many ways to earn a living.</i>

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,440
<i>We may even have to trade off</i>
<i>what we have.</i>

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,360
And I don't think that's wrong.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,200
<i>Sun.</i>

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,640
Slow your breathing.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,240
Pull yourself together.

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,560
I'm right here.

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,760
<i>I have no idea either.</i>

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,440
<i>But my gut says…</i>

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,040
Thank you so much.

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,880
…it's gonna turn out good this time.

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,640
<i>Sun…</i>

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,480
Are you in love?

28
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,760
I didn't think anyone
would be here before me.

29
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,160
Just because I got here first a few times
doesn't mean I always will.

30
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm just surprised.

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,080
Usually, you're late.

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,120
Sometimes, you don't even show up.

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
If I were younger than you,
I'd be so jealous.

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
I'd think you got in
through some connection.

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,360
What matters isn't how I got in.

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,880
It's whether I can actually do the job.

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,240
What are you two arguing about?

38
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,560
I was the first one here.

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,080
When did you get here?

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,840
I didn't see you.

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,560
I opened the office early in the morning.

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,120
Then I dozed off.
I woke up when I heard people talking.

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,360
That doesn't count.

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,720
You live here.
You can't say you got here first.

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,120
Technically, I still had to
wake up and shower.

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,520
Even if it's just a short distance,
I still have to travel,

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,920
which means I'm commuting too.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,360
We all go through the same steps.

49
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,160
And I got here first.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
I've even started working already.

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
Okay, I give up.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Do you have to take this so seriously?

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Of course. We should have standards
in everything we do.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,760
I see.

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,760
So you're going to the library today,

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,120
according to your standards?

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,040
You're catching on!

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
Well then, by my standards
as your supporter,

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,320
let me give you a ride.

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,000
About what you asked me to think over…

61
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,160
I've got my answers.

62
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,840
One,

63
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
I'm not here to mess around.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Two,

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,200
if you're worried
I might only like Sairung,

66
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,120
don't be.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,840
That's not how I think.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,360
Why?

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,760
Because I'm not you.

70
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
Hey.

71
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Hey!

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
Hey.

73
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,520
We can just meet there.

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm calling a ride.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,000
Uh… can't you think of me
as the ride you just called?

76
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,920
We have to work together anyway.

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,200
It's all for work, you know?

78
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Come in.

79
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,560
Oh, I thought it was Gudji coming in
to drop off the summary.

80
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,040
What's the matter, Pat?

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
I wanted to get your thoughts
on something.

82
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,360
About a development plan.

83
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,560
I think if we dive deeper into each story,
it would be much more interesting.

84
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,720
People these days prefer content
with real depth.

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,360
So how can I help you get
the kind of depth you're going for?

86
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
I'd like to ask for some extra hands.

87
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,920
Oh, boy.

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,600
Look, I really appreciate your effort
on the development plan,

89
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,000
but I really can't approve
any extra budget right now.

90
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm not asking to hire anyone new.

91
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,800
Just move someone
from our existing team to help me.

92
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
I mean Sun.

93
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,880
Um… Wow. Well…

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,400
I set up Sun and De
to support Sairung specifically.

95
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,920
Just temporarily.

96
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,760
You have to understand.

97
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,080
This team was set up to support Sairung,

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,040
and they've been working
really well together.

99
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,240
The workflow's been amazing.

100
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,240
If I make any changes now,
I'm worried it might throw things off.

101
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,880
But you put Sun that close to her.
Isn't that a bit concerning?

102
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,800
She even went to his place.

103
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,200
Are you concerned about the work,
or something else?

104
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,800
If Sun got in here and isn't doing
his job like everyone else,

105
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,160
but has some kind of agenda,

106
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
won't that risk messing up the work too?

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,520
Sairung is an adult.

108
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,440
She can take care of herself.

109
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,080
It's not going to affect the work.

110
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,080
Seriously, Pat.

111
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,800
Are you really worried about the work,
or is it something else?

112
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,240
Listen, I know you and Sairung
went through things together.

113
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,600
But that ended a long time ago.

114
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,760
Shouldn't you move on already?

115
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,920
So even if I care about Sairung,
I still have to move on?

116
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,080
I can sense that Sun is approaching her
with a hidden agenda.

117
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,440
And I can sense that you've got
some strange intentions here too.

118
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,120
I might be wrong.

119
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm just double-checking.

120
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,240
But well,

121
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,080
I'm just worried about Sairung.

122
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,440
And I believe

123
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,520
that when I genuinely care about someone,

124
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,200
there's no need to move on.

125
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
I'll excuse myself.

126
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,120
Prai-Fon.

127
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,080
Did I make you uncomfortable?

128
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,560
You didn't say a word the whole ride.

129
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,800
Just because I didn't say anything
doesn't mean I was uncomfortable.

130
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,240
I just needed to focus.

131
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,120
Everyone needs their own space, right?

132
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,720
But having your own space
in a small car like that,

133
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,000
it kinda felt like…

134
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,760
like…

135
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,360
Give me a reason that actually makes sense
and supports that "like…"

136
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,960
you're trying to say.

137
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,640
Like…

138
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,440
what do I have to do
to make you want to talk to me?

139
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,240
People tend to judge silence as
awkwardness, discomfort, or stress.

140
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,440
But the truth is,
silence can mean many things,

141
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,240
like being focused
or just spending time with yourself.

142
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,920
But I also understand that
being quiet and still

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,760
can come off as unwelcoming to others.

144
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,080
How about a smile?

145
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,360
Might make it look more welcoming.

146
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
Why smile? There's no reason to.

147
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
All right then.

148
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,040
I've got something that'll make you smile.

149
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,040
Hey, hey, wait.
I don't like having my photo taken.

150
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,800
Haven't you heard of the new PDPA law?
Don't you know about it?

151
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,800
PDP what?

152
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,840
See?

153
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,440
My camera is a magic tool.

154
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,960
It's the reason you're smiling.

155
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,040
When you smile, you light up.

156
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,960
You can find a seat first.

157
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,080
I'll borrow them
and bring them over to you.

158
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,560
I can help you.
I don't want to take advantage of anyone.

159
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,280
Fairness in the workplace,
or Equity Theory,

160
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,560
is really important
when it comes to teamwork.

161
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,720
Besides,

162
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,600
I don't want to be the kind of woman
who always needs to rely on a man.

163
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,600
The opposite of me.
I follow the Take Care Theory.

164
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,840
It's about taking care of
those around you.

165
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,440
If the one taking care of you
is willing to do so,

166
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,840
they won't feel taken advantage of.

167
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So you don't have to worry about it.

168
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,840
Take Care Theory?

169
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Did you just make that up?

170
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,200
I've never heard of it before.

171
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,400
These are all the books
I'd like to borrow.

172
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,720
But do you happen to have
another set of them?

173
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Yes, we do.

174
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,480
But are you really flirting with her
using this approach?

175
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,080
I have to work with her.
I want to know what she knows.

176
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,000
It'll be easier to talk if I can catch up.

177
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,360
Nice. You seem really dedicated.

178
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,720
But this is a tough way to go.

179
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,560
What is harder than reading a book

180
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,400
is reading a woman's mind.

181
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,960
I guess I'll need to come back
for more advice.

182
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,640
Anytime.

183
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,840
Thank you.

184
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,520
Women in sex work.

185
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,480
Honestly, it's still really hard
for this to be accepted,

186
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,640
especially in
a Buddhist country like this.

187
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,680
From your perspective,
what do you think about it?

188
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,200
There are two rulers for measuring this.

189
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,760
It depends on which ruler
you use to measure it.

190
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,240
If you use the ruler of religion,
morality, and ethics,

191
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,160
then this kind of thing is hard
to accept or understand.

192
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,000
But if you use the ruler
of personal rights,

193
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,840
then it's just another occupation
they can choose to do

194
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,000
because it's about individual rights.

195
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Full explanation.

196
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,600
I used to not understand either

197
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,920
why anyone would choose this kind of job

198
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,640
when there were so many
other options out there.

199
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,640
But at the same time, I get that it could
be a matter of legal regulations.

200
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,440
Hold on. Let's pause here.

201
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
For people working as sex workers,

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,600
some may see it as an undignified job.

203
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,960
But to me,

204
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,840
it's just another occupation.

205
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,200
Do you know how much money
flows into this industry?

206
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Over a hundred million baht.

207
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,280
It's a business that could actually
drive the country's economy.

208
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,120
And it also brings in tourists.

209
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
That, I know.

210
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,960
But…

211
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,040
if they had other options,

212
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,800
would they

213
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,560
still choose this occupation?

214
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,120
Are you free today?

215
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,080
Why?

216
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
You want to bring me to file
a petition for sex worker rights?

217
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,760
I want to take you to study outside.

218
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,200
We've arrived.

219
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,960
What you're doing right now
could fall under kidnapping

220
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,160
and unlawful detention.

221
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,600
And if I get any bruises,

222
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,320
that could be assault too.

223
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,640
Come on.

224
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,320
You agreeing to let me blindfold you
and get in the car with me

225
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,920
says you trust me, doesn't it?

226
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,480
If you do bad things,

227
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,880
the law won't go easy on you.

228
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,920
Just so you know.

229
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,360
- What are you doing?
- I just unfastened your seatbelt.

230
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,840
Come on out.

231
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Slowly.

232
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,000
That's right.

233
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,720
Good.

234
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,960
Walk forward slowly.

235
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,480
- The law can be pretty harsh, you know.
- I'm not going to do anything to you.

236
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,640
Relax.

237
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,560
We're taking the stairs.

238
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,400
Not yet.

239
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,880
Okay, take a step.

240
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,840
Go.

241
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,640
Here's the VIP room you reserved.

242
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,160
Thank you.

243
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,920
<i>Don't you think this is</i>
<i>too risky, Prai-Fon?</i>

244
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,360
<i>How can you trust him this much?</i>

245
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,640
Marnmok,
you can't just come out like this.

246
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,120
<i>Then why must you</i>
<i>put yourself at risk like this?</i>

247
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
Today's my turn.

248
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,440
And I'm old enough to take care of myself.

249
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,760
You may not want to open your mind,

250
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,920
but not everyone else has to
be like you, Marnmok.

251
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,839
If you think Sun can't be trusted,

252
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,040
then at least trust me.

253
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,640
The elevator's opened.

254
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,160
I hope trusting you isn't a mistake.

255
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,800
Sun, this is…

256
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,720
Go on in, please.

257
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,320
Well…

258
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
Sun, this is…

259
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,680
Sun, this is a love hotel, isn't it?!

260
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,680
What are you trying to do?

261
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,400
Hey. Didn't you say you trusted me?

262
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,120
You've opened so many books.

263
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,360
It's time to open your eyes
and see for yourself.

264
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,080
Just get in.

265
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,120
Sit right here.

266
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,800
And don't make any noise.

267
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,200
Would you like to shower first
or just get straight to it?

268
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,200
Sun, you're insane.

269
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,080
You really want me to sit through this?

270
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,360
Your wife? You two sort this out.
Don't drag me into it.

271
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,280
No, she's not…

272
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,080
Ah, you want a threesome?

273
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,720
- I'm charging double.
- No, no, no, no.

274
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,200
What are you doing?

275
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,920
Filming for YouTube or something?

276
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,840
If that's the case,
I'll need to charge you a different rate.

277
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,800
I didn't have a choice.

278
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,480
That's why I'm in this line of work.

279
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,720
Poverty pushed me into it.

280
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,160
What else could I do?
I just have to keep going.

281
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,080
Isn't this illegal?

282
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,920
Listen.

283
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,720
If you can,

284
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,080
can you help make this job legitimate?

285
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,160
So I can do it openly without fear and not
have to stay underground like this.

286
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,720
You know what?

287
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,960
Sex work is legal in many countries.

288
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,760
It's only our country
where it still isn't.

289
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,480
And another thing. This is my body.

290
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,800
I can do what I want with it.

291
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,000
If I want to use it to earn a living,
that's not wrong, is it?

292
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,720
I still have my pride.

293
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,080
This is honest work.

294
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,280
It's not like I'm stealing from anyone.

295
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,040
Honestly? Those reporters
who twist the truth,

296
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,560
the ones who take sides,

297
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,880
I think they're the ones
with no ethics or morals, not me.

298
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,200
Here it is.

299
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,080
The most important thing in my life.

300
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm done here.
Thanks for using my service.

301
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,360
<i>Mommy.</i>

302
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,800
Yes, dear?

303
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,640
I just finished work.
I'm heading home to you now.

304
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,440
Wanna stay and use the room?

305
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,360
Are you crazy?

306
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,400
Back off.

307
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,960
- We'll only lie there. Traffic's bad now.
- No, no, no, no.

308
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,760
- I already paid for the room.
- Sun!

309
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,320
- I already paid.
- No!

310
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,320
People are so diverse, aren't they?

311
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
There's just too much variety
to stereotype anyone

312
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,840
or define what they should be.

313
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,320
Everyone is an individual,

314
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,200
with their own traits and differences.

315
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,960
But yeah…

316
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,440
Since we have to live with others,

317
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,200
we just need to accept
and understand them, that's all.

318
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,640
But to find someone who accepts
and understands who you are,

319
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,120
that's not easy, right?

320
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,000
If it were,

321
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,440
you'd have someone who understands
and accepts you already.

322
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,160
How do you know I'm not seeing anyone?

323
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Listen.

324
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,120
You've been with me for hours.

325
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,880
I haven't seen a single text or call.
Nothing at all.

326
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,480
You've gotta be single, right?

327
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,240
You're smart.

328
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What about you?

329
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,600
Don't you want to be with anyone?

330
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I want someone who understands me.

331
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,640
And I already gave it a try.

332
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,840
But…

333
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,960
Pat?

334
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,240
Pat wasn't at fault.

335
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,760
It's me

336
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,720
who's…

337
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,480
at odds with myself.

338
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,640
Prai-Fon.

339
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,400
Can I try too?

340
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,920
Sometimes, silence

341
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,480
means yes.

342
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,960
Flip-book?

343
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,360
Fly out of the book sometimes.

344
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,040
The world out there…

345
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,960
has its own angles too.

346
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,000
I'll fly with you.

347
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,080
Whoa.

348
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,480
Damn. This is really late.

349
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,040
Usually, Prai-Fon's never home this late.

350
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,640
Didn't you say your daughter was an adult?

351
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,080
This is my daughter I'm worried about.
Do you expect me to move on?

352
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,800
If it's my ex who's now my colleague,
do I really have to move on?

353
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,240
You're the one who brought it up.

354
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,520
Fine.

355
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,280
With a big mouth like that,
let's see if you can hold your liquor too.

356
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,440
Let's sit and talk. Come on.

357
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,440
Only one, bro. I still have work tomorrow.

358
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,160
It's really hard, bro.

359
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,720
To get over Sairung.

360
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,880
I still have to see her every day here.

361
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,640
Okay.

362
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,920
But how long are you going to
keep torturing yourself like this?

363
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,880
Aren't you tired, man?

364
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,480
That was a long time ago, bro.

365
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,800
I'm not exactly torturing myself, bro.

366
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,800
But when we once were together,

367
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,440
it's only natural to still care.

368
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,400
Mmm, you're right.

369
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,640
Your case was tough,

370
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,840
handling five personalities
in one woman. Right?

371
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,360
I know, right, bro?!

372
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,680
Hold up. Let me call this out real quick.

373
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,200
Just call me Theppachai,

374
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,760
not "bro."

375
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,640
It's starting to make me cringe.

376
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,560
Got it, bro.

377
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,200
Did he really get it?

378
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,680
Seriously, bro.

379
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,640
I just can't trust Sun.

380
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,080
He seems to have some kind of agenda.

381
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,920
Oh, come on.

382
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,160
Drop your weird suspicion.

383
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,360
Are you jealous?

384
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,680
<i>Old flame is…</i>

385
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,920
Tell me straight.

386
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,160
How did you and Sun meet?

387
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,400
What was he doing before this?

388
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,800
And why does he have De as his assistant?

389
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,920
Jealous. You're clearly jealous.

390
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,840
Am I right?

391
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,920
You're jealous, right?

392
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,480
Am I right?

393
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,360
Can't you answer this simple question?

394
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,400
<i>Old flame is ready to be ignited</i>

395
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,360
Who is Sun, exactly?

396
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,680
You're back.

397
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,600
It's late.

398
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,160
So late, actually.

399
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,960
Where have you two been?

400
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,520
Why are you home this late?

401
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,320
We went to a love hotel.

402
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,480
Okay.

403
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,760
A love hotel?

404
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,200
Did you…?

405
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,560
Did you go with her?
Did you go to the love hotel with her?

406
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,360
Wait, "a love hotel" what? Is that
the name of a shop or something?

407
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,160
Do explain.

408
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,800
Wait, talk to me first.

409
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,240
You're acting suspicious again,
Mr. Theppachai.

410
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,120
Now Prai-Fon's another one
digging into her mom's death.

411
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,960
Yesterday, I saw her going through
a whole stack of old news articles.

412
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,720
KRITSANA REAL ESTATE EXPOSED
IN WIDESPREAD SCANDAL ALLEGATIONS

413
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
REAL ESTATE TYCOON
DENIES ALL ALLEGATIONS

414
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,840
Why does this feel more serious than just
getting her to fall in love and break up?

415
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,680
I don't know.

416
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,880
I'll ask the librarian again.

417
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,000
As for you,

418
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,000
go dig through
the old newspapers over there.

419
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,000
And you, just go help Decha.

420
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,200
Stop. Hold on. I'm not your minion.

421
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,560
You're so quick with the orders.

422
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm not falling for it.

423
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,240
I'm just tagging along.

424
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,720
Now that you're here,
can't you do this for Sairung?

425
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,520
Come on, sis. Give me a hand.

426
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,960
I'll treat you
to some fermented fish Somtam.

427
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,920
All right.

428
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,640
Hang on a sec.

429
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,480
I need to take a dump.

430
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,960
Already? You just ate.

431
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,480
Help me find the restroom.

432
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,920
Come on.

433
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,120
If you're looking for old news,
the archived newspapers are over there.

434
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,560
Your friend with glasses is digging into
the years around 2003 to 2004.

435
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,440
How did you know what I was thinking?

436
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,080
If you want to win her over,

437
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,320
you'll need to know
everything she knows, right?

438
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,520
Those books yesterday
were only part of it.

439
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Your friend's been digging into
these old reports for quite a while,

440
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,800
so they're probably more important
than the whole sex worker topic.

441
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,560
The stack of newspapers she went through,
they haven't been shelved yet.

442
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,760
They're still on the sorting desk.

443
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,360
Why don't you start there? You'll probably
find exactly what you're looking for.

444
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,760
Who are you, exactly?

445
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,640
Who do you think I am?

446
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,240
A mind reader?

447
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,440
A cupid.

448
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,240
Thank you.

449
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
Did you find it?

450
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,080
Can you help take these books?

451
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,600
I don't think this is a small matter.

452
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,880
KRITSANA: A NEW GENERATION LEADER

REAL ESTATE TYCOON

460
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,600
Why does he look so familiar?

461
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,560
Gudji, is Storm
going to the boxing gym today?

462
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,480
Yes.

463
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,239
I saw her carrying her gym stuff
earlier than usual.

464
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,440
I'm going to check on Storm.

465
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,880
Something feels off.

466
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,239
You gather this info.

467
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,880
- I'll be back soon.
- Got it, bro.

468
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,040
Take it easy, Coach Chatch.

469
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,199
You're training like
you're out to kill someone.

470
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,960
You've got a student coming in
for a private lesson today.

471
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,520
Want a rematch?

472
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,720
Sun.

473
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,600
I don't have time to play with you today.

474
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,040
I'm not here to play around.

475
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,440
I really want to train with you.

476
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,880
At least let me sit and watch.

477
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,920
Why are you so up in my business?

478
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,680
I'm just worried.

479
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,800
Be my cornerman then.

480
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,800
Got it, champ.

481
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,920
Come on.

482
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,440
Punch.

483
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,600
Kick.

484
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,400
Hit. Good.

485
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Your kicks are so strong.
Ever thought about competing?

486
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,400
No.

487
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,440
Why not? You've got real potential.

488
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
I just want some skills to protect myself.

489
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,600
This world is dangerous.

490
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,720
You must have been through a lot,
to be that scared.

491
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,960
You're still so young.

492
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,440
I've been going through it
since I was a kid.

493
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,000
Since 19 years ago, to be exact.

494
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,800
Don't space out, Coach.

495
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,360
All right.

496
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,400
Before you became a boxing coach,
what did you do?

497
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,960
Punch.

498
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,880
Ouch.

499
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,360
Before you became a boxing coach,
what did you do?

500
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,040
Just odd jobs.

501
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,960
What's with all the questions?!

502
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,960
Who did you work for?

503
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,920
Come on.

504
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,280
Come on.

505
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,280
Come on.

506
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,600
That's all for today.
I've got something else to take care of.

507
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,960
You can keep interrogating me next time.

508
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,880
You okay?

509
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,520
You're not really here to practice boxing.

510
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,840
You should stay out of this.

511
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,080
It doesn't concern you.

512
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,880
You know how risky this matter is.

513
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,760
Do you know what the matter is?

514
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,360
Can't you just stick to your job?

515
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,480
Why do you keep bothering Storm?

516
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,320
Or… do you have some other agenda
besides working for <i>Truth Today?</i>

517
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,920
Did you follow me?

518
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
You think you're the only one
worried about Storm?

519
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,560
I'm worried about her too.

520
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,880
But no one else worries me.

521
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,560
It's the risk from you that does.

522
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,520
You two fight. I gotta go now.

523
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,360
Are you digging into Kritsana?

524
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,520
I'm not sure what it's all about,

525
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,320
but this matter is too serious
for you to deal with alone.

526
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,920
Storm is not alone in this.

527
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,600
I'll help her.

528
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,720
Are you sure?

529
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,080
You're getting involved with
a real estate tycoon like Kritsana.

530
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,360
Someone with serious power.

531
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,560
Aren't you worried about Storm's safety?

532
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Of course I'm worried about her safety.

533
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,920
That's exactly why I want to help her.

534
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
But what I'm even more worried about

535
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,200
is that the truth will be buried.

536
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,640
What truth are you even talking about?
I don't get it.

537
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,080
It's something major
that's stuck with me all these years.

538
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,120
If what I believe is true,

539
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,000
I might be able to overcome
this dissociative identity disorder.

540
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,040
How would it help Storm
overcome the issue?

541
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,320
I've known Storm for a long time.

542
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,080
I know what's been making her suffer
in life and in her mind.

543
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,760
I suggest you don't do anything
beyond your job scope.

544
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,960
Just stick to your responsibilities.

545
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,840
What you're doing now

546
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,560
seems a bit outside your scope.

547
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,160
But I'm worried about her.

548
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,800
As for that…

549
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,560
I think it's beyond
your job scope as well.

550
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,680
<i>What are you trying to do, Storm?</i>

551
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
<i>You're putting everyone at risk again.</i>

552
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,720
<i>You have your way. I have mine.</i>

553
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,280
<i>Don't overstep, Marnmok.</i>

554
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,000
<i>I don't know what this is all about,</i>

555
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,040
but I know you're hiding
something from me.

556
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,440
Marnmok, have you been secretly
following us while we're in the light?

557
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,720
Quit trying to be our mom.

558
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,880
What kind of guy
do you like being around, Fahsai?

559
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
- Sun, hurry up and follow me.
- Wait.

560
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,600
This made me think of Mom.

561
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,840
That's Coach Chatch.

562
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,440
Did Storm know about this?

563
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
<i>What is the truth you mentioned?</i>

564
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,200
Your mom's suicide?

565
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,120
- She didn't do it.
- Then who did it? Fahsai. Fahsai!
