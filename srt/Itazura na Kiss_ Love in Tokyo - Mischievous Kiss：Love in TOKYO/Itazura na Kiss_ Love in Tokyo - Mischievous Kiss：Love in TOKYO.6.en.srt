1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,560
It is said that couples who kiss on graduation day...

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,250
will be together forever.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,980
Look at that!

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,000
A kiss?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,730
My first kiss?

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,620
I enjoyed this year the most, out of the three years.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,150
Out of my eighteen years, this is the year I suffered the most.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,800
You and I aren't good at studying,

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
so we should find something that we are good at.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,990
If I find something [I like] and make it big,

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,270
will you love me?

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,390
She finally realized

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,500
who cares about her the most.

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,600
Kin Chan! Sorry, for being late!

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,990
Irie and Kotoko-chan are destined to be together.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,390
-Don't be joking.
-You cold-blooded person!

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,170
But you love this cold-blooded person, don't you?

18
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,310
I...

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,510
and I...

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,370
kissed, didn't we?

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,850
Come with me.

22
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,880
What is it?! I'm...

23
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,180
going to quit liking you, Irie-kun.

24
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,510
So you are going to forget about me?

25
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,890
Then, let's see if you can forget about me.

26
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,440
Sorry.

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,930
I've been feeling kind of weird, since that day.

28
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,760
I just couldn't be honest.

29
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,950
It was just a dream.

30
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:30,680
Since that day, I've been waking up to this kind of dream.

31
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,820
But,

32
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,120
there won't be a second kiss.

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,200
The relationship between Irie-kun and I, hasn't made any progress.

34
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,150
And now the short spring break, is over.

35
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,170
Starting today, Irie-kun and I

36
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,670
are college students.

37
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,560
Tonan University
Day of Entrance Ceremony [First Day of School Ceremony]

38
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,820
-Hey.
-Yes.

39
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,410
How long are you going to follow me?

40
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,230
Are you going to the science and engineering department?

41
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,000
Ah, right. I'm in the literature department.

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,060
Bye.

43
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,150
So you

44
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,250
came to the science and engineering department to spy on Naoki?

45
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,210
You still haven't made any progress since high school, Kotoko.

46
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,670
The quality of her love will never change.

47
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,800
But I only see men in the science and engineering department.

48
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,720
It seems like you don't have to worry about girls around Irie.

49
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,060
You are safe, Kotoko.

50
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,510
Kotoko, look at her!

51
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,650
Wh-Who is that pretty girl?

52
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,490
Wow, I can see her sparkling on this campus with men.

53
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,650
Irie-kun.

54
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,650
Irie Naoki!

55
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,220
Have you chosen your elective course?

56
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,610
No, I haven't.

57
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,170
-What should I chose?
-Wow!

58
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,770
Jinko! Satomi!

59
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,780
Um..

60
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,240
Do you want something?

61
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,820
I was wondering what kind of desks are used in the science and engineering department.

62
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,760
She is hopeless.

63
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,700
Is she your girlfriend?

64
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,000
No way.

65
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,420
"No way"?

66
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,650
We even kissed,

67
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,170
but still "no way"?

68
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,220
What is going to happen to my

69
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,360
college year?!

Mischievous Kiss: Love In Tokyo

89
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,310
-You kissed!
-You are too loud.

90
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,110
How am I not going to be loud after hearing this?

91
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,950
Episode 6
A Love Rival?! Love with Lots of Trouble 
You kissed!

92
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,330
But from what I saw, it didn't seem like that at all.

93
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,480
I know...

94
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,840
Serves you right.

95
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,570
I can't understand what Irie-kun is thinking at all.

96
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,490
Stop being a wimp!

97
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,160
You gave your precious first kiss to Naoki.

98
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,590
She's right! You have to be strong.

99
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,450
You are a freshmen in college.

100
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,910
Plus, it's spring. A season where you meet someone new.

101
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:14,190
If you just sit and do nothing,
that pretty girl is going to get Naoki.

102
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,090
Aihara

103
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,060
Welcome.

104
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,360
Ai-chan!

105
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,750
Thank you so much for inviting us.

106
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,350
We have to celebrate for Naoki and Kotoko for their first day of college.

107
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,450
Please go ahead and have a seat.

108
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,100
Thank you.
Let's go sit down.

109
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm excited for this.

110
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,900
This restaurant has very good taste.

111
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,850
Isn't it?
Ai-chan said this is highest quality,

112
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,390
of Japanese paper that is used in this restaurant.

113
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,520
Oh really?

114
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,810
So you can't make it dirty.

115
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,020
And these chopsticks also the highest quality too.

116
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,940
You also can't make them get dirty.

117
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,150
Then we can't eat.

118
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,240
I will eat it with my stomach.

119
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,560
Welcome.

120
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,450
Kin-chan?

121
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,270
Oh my god, you look so different.

122
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,050
I couldn't recognize you at all.

123
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,930
You look better like that.

124
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,150
Thank you so much, Madam.

125
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,570
But why are you working here at Aihara?

126
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,640
I started working as a trainee here,

127
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,250
In order to become a professional chef.

128
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,630
I see.

129
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,340
You've been good at cooking from before, right?

130
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,560
Compared to a professional chef's food, my food is not that good enough.

131
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,350
But I will work harder to become a
better chef than your father.

132
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,960
And I will become the best chef in Japan.

133
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,300
I won't lose against you.

134
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,600
I will become a professional chef,

135
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,980
and make a lot of money.
and I will come to get you.

136
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,350
Be prepared for that!

137
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,290
Kinnosuke, how long will you
stay there?

138
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,750
Sorry, I'll be faster.

139
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,650
Can you help me do this?

140
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,570
These are not even.
I can't give them out to customers.

141
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,400
- I'm sorry.
- Here let me show you.

142
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,020
- Fold each side carefully.
- Yes.

143
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,700
Yes.

144
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,790
Thank you for coming.

145
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,810
Kin-chan.

146
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,850
Yeah.

147
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,340
Now you found what you want to do.

148
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,420
I'm so impressed.
Wish you good luck.

149
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,350
Okay.

150
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,310
Good luck with your studying at school too.

151
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,040
Jinko and Satomi too.

152
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,730
Cut it well by pushing the blade of the knife.

153
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,440
Okay.

154
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,000
This is too thick.

155
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,400
Okay.

156
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,520
You can go take a bath now.

157
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,100
Um, Irie-kun.

158
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,350
What?

159
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,280
Um, I..

160
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,370
Who was that girl earlier from the science
and engineer department?

161
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,380
Oh, you mean Matsumoto Yuko?

162
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,380
Huh? You knew her full-name already?

163
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,480
I told you, I won't forget easily if I hear it once.

164
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,130
Um, Is it possible that,

165
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,560
Matsumoto-san likes you?

166
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,400
What? Hey, are you jealous?

167
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,550
Oh, how is it possible.

168
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,560
Come to think of this,

169
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,550
she quite pretty though.

170
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,270
She has a good body.

171
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,310
And she also smart.

172
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,540
She said she used to be the 5th place
on the national exam.

173
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,020
Why did that kind of person attend our school?

174
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,350
Who knows?
Maybe she has another purpose.

175
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,310
Now what's this?

176
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,690
I thought you already forgot about me.

177
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,670
Ah, that's right.

178
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,020
We kissed, didn't we?

179
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,440
Now you won't forget about me, right?

180
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,310
WIll this be...

181
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,520
the second kiss?

182
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,350
I've been,

183
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,400
teased.

184
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,900
Irie-kun,

185
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,690
doesn't care about,

186
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,500
our kiss.

187
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,460
This is unfair.

188
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,420
So that girl's named Matsumoto Yuko?

189
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,390
She is pretty and smart.

190
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,840
She's like a female version of Irie.

191
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,110
Well, I guess Irie and her are a good match.

192
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,070
Please don't say such a thing.

193
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,420
But you have to be pragmatic.

194
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,190
Obviously she's targeting Irie.

195
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,400
Kotoko, you're in big trouble now.

196
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,690
Let's eat some food to make you feel better.

197
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,240
What should we eat?

198
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,840
Kotoko.

199
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,380
Kotoko?

200
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,750
You still haven't order anything yet?

201
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,020
I was spaced out.
Sorry.

202
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,340
-Then we will go sit down first, okay?
- Okay.

203
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,980
Well, Lunch A is hamburger steak.

204
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,700
Lunch B is deep fried shrimp.

205
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,800
Can't you think without
saying it out loud?

206
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,840
Can I get the Lunch A, please?

207
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,980
For me, I would like...

208
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,330
They don't have Lunch F.

209
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,250
I'm getting Lunch A too.

210
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,700
Two Lunch A's, here.

211
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,860
Why are they so different?

212
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,800
Excuse me, Sir?

213
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,100
Do you have any complaints?

214
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,710
Did you just complain about the fairness of my food servings?

215
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,380
You must have got some nerve.

216
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Kin-chan?

217
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,500
Why are you here?

218
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
You said you found what you wanted to do.

219
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,300
You're not working at my father's restaurant anymore?

220
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,650
I do,

221
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,620
I work for the restaurant at night.

222
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,800
During lunch, I'm working here at this cafeteria.

223
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,950
I'm going to learn how to cook inexpensive food and,

224
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,710
also high quality restaurant's food as well.
Isn't it awesome?

225
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:16,420
And also, I have to protect Kotoko from that evil guy.

226
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,730
What do you say, Mr. Genius?
Are you that surprised until you can't say anything?

227
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,090
I'm impressed that.

228
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,120
A man who can change his whole life just for one girl.

229
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,720
I can't do that like you.

230
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,380
What did you say?

231
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,600
I going to leave you two alone here.
Please enjoy.

232
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,550
I bet that you must be scared of Kin-chan's love power.

233
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,440
Right, Kotoko?

234
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,440
But somehow, Kin-chan is right.

235
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,810
A man can get attracted to a woman easily if they stay close to each other.

236
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,060
Kotoko,

237
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,500
you should learn that from Kin-chan.

238
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,350
That's right.

239
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,940
Even though you both are in the same college.
He's in science and engineering,

240
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,710
and you're in the literature department.

241
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,100
You two have different campuses.

242
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,200
It's not going to be the same like in high school.

243
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,100
Matsumoto Yuko is from the same department as him,
so she has a bigger chances.

244
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,900
Plus, she is beautiful and got a perfect body.

245
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,790
What should I do?

246
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,890
Oh found you, Irie.

247
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,610
- Sudo-san, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

248
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,350
Who is that old man?

249
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,310
I don't know.

250
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,560
A senior?

251
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,630
Or is he a professor?

252
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,350
You know why I'm here today, don't you?

253
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,710
If you'd like to... No, if you'd really like to...

254
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,210
join our club.

255
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,020
I don't have the feeling of joining any clubs.

256
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,350
Please don't say that.

257
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,420
We've known each other since elementary school.

258
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,250
I going to wait for you after school.

259
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,080
Okay?

260
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,440
Adiós (Goodbye - In Spanish)

261
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,300
Kotoko,

262
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,550
your chance is here!

263
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,750
You should go join the same club as Irie.

264
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,690
Then you can be with him, even if

265
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,690
you're not in the same department as him.

266
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,600
That's right.
This is your chance to kick that Matsumoto Yuko out!

267
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,150
That's right!

268
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,670
I'll definitely do it.

269
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,350
I'm going to take your fried shrimp.

270
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,400
So good!

271
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,480
Irie-kun, are you going to join a club?

272
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,400
Which club are you going to join?

273
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm not going to tell you.

274
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,340
Why not?

275
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,770
Because I have a feeling that you're going to join the same one.

276
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,450
Huh?

277
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,440
That..

278
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,850
He knows what we were thinking.

279
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,310
He seriously is a genius.

280
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,100
I'm not going to give up.

281
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,440
Let's do this.

282
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,110
Let's do it.

283
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,380
That old man said he will be waiting for him after school.

284
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,490
That means if I'm following him, I will be able to find out which club he's going to join.

285
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,880
Anyway, I didn't know that there are so many
different kinds of clubs.

286
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:47,730
I'm wondering which club will Irie-kun join.

287
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,600
That's it, it's that room!

288
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,870
Can I join this club?

289
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,180
The Anime Study Group club?

290
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,680
Sorry,

291
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,320
Was Irie-kun here?

292
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,170
Irie?

293
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,010
Who is that?

294
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,600
Is it that man who was just here earlier and left?

295
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,420
Please excuse me.

296
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,240
You're so late.
I said we should go together.

297
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,120
You only decided that by yourself.

298
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,530
Anyway.

299
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,700
It doesn't matter since we're going to be the same club.

300
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,250
The same club?

301
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,200
Let's go inside.

302
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,550
Fine.

303
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,290
Excuse me, I wonder if I could join this club too.

304
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,660
Well,

305
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,100
Who are you?
Who recommended you?

306
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,390
No one suggest me here, but...

307
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,390
I'd really like to join...

308
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,650
Tonan University Tennis Club.

309
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,650
I said to myself that if I attend Tonan University, I would definitely join the tennis club.

310
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,370
Nice to meet you all.

311
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,560
It's all right, Captain.
Everyone with passion is welcomed.

312
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,120
What is your name?

313
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,890
I'm Aihara Kotoko.

314
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,600
Kotoko-chan! Come inside.
I'm Sudo. I'm in charge of the new members.

315
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,700
We were just going to begin a welcome party for our new members.

316
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,160
You come stand on this side.

317
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,270
Let me start the explaination.

318
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,860
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask Sudo.

319
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,280
I will explain to you anything, and my phone number.

320
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,630
What about this?

321
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,000
Wow, is this for me?

322
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,910
I'm glad that Kotoko-chan is going to play tennis.

323
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,380
I was pretty good at this when I was young.

324
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,740
- You used to play tennis?
- That's right.

325
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,790
I also used to teach Naoki when he first started playing tennis.

326
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,840
Hey Naoki, don't you think that Kotoko-chan's tennis outfit is adorable?

327
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,550
What you think?

328
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,540
I don't think it's a good idea to start picking your outfit now.

329
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,240
You did well.

330
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,360
You and Naoki joined the same club.

331
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,370
That means you two are in love.

332
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,820
But,

333
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,830
It's nothing like that.

334
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,710
Irie-kun is so popular.

335
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,140
What?

336
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,900
Mrs. Irie.

337
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,570
Do you think that Irie-kun likes girls,

338
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:24,680
who are beautiful and intelligent?

339
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,500
Don't tell me that there's such a girl around Naoki?

340
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,110
Wow.
I didn't know that he was that popular.

341
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,620
He's blind.

342
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,400
But don't worry, Kotoko-chan.

343
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,230
From now on, visit the science and engineering department often and approach him. That's the only way.

344
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,360
No matter how great that girl is,

345
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,430
you are the best girl for Naoki.

346
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,960
Well...

347
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,240
I know that because I've been watching you during the time we've been together.

348
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,680
Okay? I'm cheering for you!

349
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,490
Yeah.

350
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,470
Hold this racket. And make a pose.
Wow, you look gorgeous.

351
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,540
Swing!

352
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:31,410
Great. Now I'm going for my love.

353
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,940
Good job, Kotoko!

354
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,660
What are you doing?

355
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,040
Good, Kotoko. Nice.

356
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,910
All right, all of our new members.

357
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,640
Today is the first day of practice, so we will have a quick test.

358
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,920
We going to take a look at your skill.
Please try your best.

359
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,260
Yes.

360
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,280
What is this?

361
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,670
A test? No one told me that!

362
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:30,110
Your rival is Sudo from the Junior year,
who is in charge of our new members.

363
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,740
I'm Sudo. Nice to meet you all.

364
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,380
Nice to meet you.

365
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,490
I'm glad that Sudo here.

366
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,030
You still don't know anything.

367
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,640
Huh? What is it?

368
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,050
Now Sudo seems to have changed.

369
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,440
Then...

370
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,830
Wada, you go first.

371
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,860
What? I'm the first one?

372
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,730
You thought it would be in the alphabetical order or what?

373
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,600
I'm the type of man who likes to change things up.

374
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,090
Wada, come out to the court.

375
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,970
What's with your vacant look! Can't you see the ball?!

376
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,240
-He's called the Evil Sudo.
-Use your body! More!!

377
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,770
Next! Yada,

378
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,980
-come in!
-Yes.

379
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,810
As soon as Sudo-san grabs a racket,
his personality completely changes.

380
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,300
He was famous for that since the elementary school.

381
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,520
He's usually peaceful but...

382
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,200
Next! Miyamoto,

383
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,820
come in!

384
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,630
Matsumoto-san is great.

385
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,070
She's was one of the best 4 female single players
in high school.

386
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,420
She has a high GPA, too.

387
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,790
If she wanted, she could've gone to any school she liked.

388
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,110
Tonan's tennis team is prestigious.

389
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,920
Why does Irie-kun know all that?

390
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,690
She asked me for a counseling when she applied for college.

391
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,500
We've known each other since the 10th grade
from the national (championship).

392
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,110
When I was in my 10th grade,

393
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,640
I didn't know Irie-kun.

394
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,320
I only saw him alone.

395
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,030
That means Matsumoto-san knew

396
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,250
Irie-kun longer than me.

397
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,460
I'll probably lose.

398
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,800
Oh, Matsumoto, you did good as always.

399
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,020
-Thank you.
-Next!

400
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,850
Irie Naoki.

401
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,940
Come in.

402
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,390
Yes.

403
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,590
Finally this day came.

404
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,920
Right, please be gentle.

405
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,230
There is no way I would go easy on you.

406
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,060
Irie-kun is great.

407
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,650
Good, stop there. Irie, come out of the court.

408
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,320
Wait, Irie! One more round!

409
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,130
-Sudo, today's only a test.
-No, one more round!

410
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,570
Irie Naoki is as good as the rumors.

411
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,480
Look at Sudo-san's face.

412
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,660
Ah~ He's upset. The next kid is dead.

413
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,710
NEXT! AIHARA KOTOKO!

414
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,700
COME IN!

415
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,160
-Don't walk so slow!
-Yes!

416
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,880
Excuse me,

417
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,610
it's my first time playing a tennis.

418
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:50,180
-Shut up! Let's GO!
-Yes!

419
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,970
What's up with her...

420
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,300
Don't run away! Grab your racket!

421
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,630
-Open your EYES! Let's go!
-Yes.

422
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,420
Oh my god, Aihara fainted.

423
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,240
Are you alright, Kotoko-chan?

424
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,380
Still Kotoko is lame.

425
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,720
-Yuki!
-Kotoko-chan,

426
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,010
why don't you skip tomorrow's practice?

427
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,880
My club won't let me. The new comers can't be absent.

428
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,200
I'm fine. I'll be used to it soon.

429
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,770
-Don't overwork since you're a girl.
-Yes.

430
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:26,150
-Is there any other part you got hurt?
-I'm okay now.

431
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,620
Just a little bit of muscle pain.

432
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,050
[Aihara]

433
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,750
Master, where should I do with this?

434
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,070
-Oh, clean and peel them off.
-Yes.

435
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,050
Hey, Kinnosuke,

436
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:08,780
-you are working at the University in the day time, right?
-Yes.

437
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,420
How is she? How's Kotoko doing at the University...?

438
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,090
Well... She's nothing different from high school.

439
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,160
She must have changed. Besides, she's in her prime.

440
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,780
And... That...

441
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,880
Like having a boy friend...?

442
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,910
I'm looking out for her, so a bad bug won't attach to her.

443
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,460
I mean... What about Naoki-kun?

444
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,470
Master, it's alright.

445
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,200
I'll make sure to protect her from that guy's scheme.

446
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,190
And after going to a college, they have different classes.

447
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,810
They seem to have a lot more far away

448
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,450
to each other than the high school time.

449
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,150
Well it's about that justice wins.

450
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,360
Hey, Kinnosuke . . . kun.

451
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,770
Yes.

452
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,310
Can you pass along a message for me?

453
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,900
Kotoko-chan, is your face okay?

454
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,780
-There.
-Don't, that hurts.

455
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,340
I heard. Tonan's tennis club is very strict.

456
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:34,430
It's too strict, so most new members quit
and only 2 or 3 people remain.

457
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,690
Kotoko, will you be able to continue?

458
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,090
It's for being with Irie-kun. I'll try harder!

459
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,920
-Stop that. Here, here, here.
-Kin-chan.

460
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,460
[Kotoko LOVE]
Kin-chan, only for Kotoko? You're cheap.

461
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,590
You're loud. Move aside, there.

462
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,060
It's Kin-chan special.

463
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,910
Hey, Kotoko,

464
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,430
quit the tennis club.

465
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,870
There's no need and it's not worth hurting your pretty face.

466
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,790
Since I got in, I want to try more.

467
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,700
I learned from my dad that it's not good to quit and give up.

468
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,230
Kotoko...

469
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,810
Such a beautiful mind.

470
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,530
Right, I have a message from your dad.

471
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,960
He said "Come to Aihara tonight."

472
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,070
-Why?
-Don't know. He said he has something to tell you.

473
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,720
-Well eat first.
- Thank you for food.

474
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,490
You guys ate a lot while we were talking!

475
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:49,400
That doesn't work. And besides the "LOVE"... !

476
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,280
-Delicious.
-That's my "LOVE"...

477
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,230
What you all are doing? Move faster!

478
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,290
Lower your waist!

479
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:05,880
You guys really don't have much of energy.
This tennis club doesn't need such people.

480
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,390
Just give up already.

481
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,890
-What, really want to quit?
-No.

482
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,520
Right? The river is flowing.

483
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,140
-Forest is alive. What about us?
-Alive.

484
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:24,110
That's right. Okay, rest. Rest time is over.

485
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,750
Listen carefully. You guys don't have time for resting.

486
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,750
-Sit-up 100 times!
-Yes.

487
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,640
-Got it?
-Yes!

488
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,580
Then one!

489
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,140
Is this tennis club?

490
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,060
It's all basic work out routine.

491
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,810
And Irie-kun and Matsumoto Yuko joined
the club with me, but they aren't here.

492
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:50,160
What's going on?

493
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:59,260
Oh my god, I'm sorry, Kotoko-san. Can you throw it back?

494
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,880
He... Hey!

495
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,380
Hey, you!

496
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,870
You're a new member. Why are you inside of court?
What about the basic routine?

497
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:16,830
What, you didn't know?
Tonan's tennis club put skills in priority.

498
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:23,010
Even the new members can practice
in court for passing yesterday's test,

499
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,970
Is that so? Then how about Irie-kun?

500
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,150
Irie-kun is more special.

501
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,500
He joined the club with conditions that he'll come to club whenever he likes and for the competitions.

502
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,380
No way. Does that mean he won't come to practice?

503
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,240
Then what am I here for?

504
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,520
Ah, I heard.

505
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,100
That you live with him.

506
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,780
But you don't know anything about him.

507
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,440
Well I guess that's the relationship you have with him.

508
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,180
Aihara, what are you doing there?

509
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,800
Do sit-up 100 times and run 100 rounds!

510
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,370
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

511
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,820
Kotoko, you're here.

512
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,750
Hey Kinnosuke, when did I say
you could leave your position?

513
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,200
There are a lot more dirty dishes.

514
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,880
I'm sorry.

515
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,990
I will see you at school!

516
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,430
What's wrong with you, Kotoko?

517
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,360
My muscles are sore.

518
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,550
What?

519
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,250
Anyway what did you want to tell me?

520
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,310
Well...

521
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,030
We going to use the private room for a while.

522
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,650
Yes.

523
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,590
Are you all right?

524
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,280
It looks delicious!

525
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,470
Thank you for the food.

526
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,620
It tastes better after exercising.

527
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,120
You're not that good at playing sports.

528
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,410
And I know you're not even interested in tennis either.

529
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,910
Are you perhaps doing it for Naoki-kun?

530
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,670
Why are you asking me like that so suddenly?

531
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,640
Listen, Kotoko.

532
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,350
It's been almost a year since we moved in with the Irie family.

533
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,860
I've been thinking a lot about this.

534
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:55,150
I don't think we should be depending on their help any longer.

535
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,480
I know that, Irie-chan and Mrs. Irie,

536
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,280
are treating you well.

537
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,180
To be honest,
I did wish that you and Naoki-kun would...

538
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,590
I thought that you both could be together in the future.

539
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,310
Father.

540
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,170
But I've watched you two for a long time...

541
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:24,440
but Naoki-kun seems to have no interest in you.

542
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,270
So I guess this plan won't work.

543
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,600
Let's return back to our way of life.
Just the two of us.

544
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,390
Okay, Kotoko?

545
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,410
Of course, I do want to respect your feelings.

546
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:04,630
But I've found a nice place nearby.

547
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:10,180
I want you to think about my feelings too.

548
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,820
I...

549
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,780
don't want to see you getting hurt.

550
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:28,680
But if I move out of the Irie's house now...

551
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:37,110
There will be no more connection between Irie-kun and me.

552
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:47,240
What are you looking at?

553
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,140
Irie-kun!

554
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,720
Are you heading home?

555
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,540
Where did you go?

556
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,200
I don't have to tell you
where I went.

557
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,130
How about you?

558
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,080
It's so late now.

559
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,610
I went to my father's restaurant.

560
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,380
- Your father's restaurant?
- Yeah.

561
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:17,860
Did you, perhaps, go there to see that guy?

562
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,350
That guy?

563
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,370
Never mind.
Forget it.

564
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:30,260
My father said he found a nice place for us to live.

565
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,340
What?

566
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,840
He found a new house.

567
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,680
He said he hasn't sign the contract yet.

568
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:52,120
It's been almost a year since we started living in your family.

569
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,320
That's why he thought about it that way.

570
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,230
That's why...

571
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,060
So are you moving out?

572
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,300
If we do...

573
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,240
would you be sad?

574
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,230
Irie-kun?

575
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,400
It's look like I can finally go back to live in my old way.

576
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,710
I don't understand.

577
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,830
I still don't understand...

578
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,570
Irie-kun's feeling.

579
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:04,820
What should I do?

580
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,940
I decided to move out from Irie-kun's house.

581
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,030
What did you just say?

582
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,560
We will play doubles.

583
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,540
Your partner is Aihara Kotoko.

584
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,660
Don't ever get in my way.

585
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,110
Irie's feeling might change
if you succeed by working together.

586
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:58,810
Are you trying so hard to play tennis
because you want to stay with Irie?

587
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,290
We will definitely win.

588
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,260
Got it?

589
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:06,590
How can you stay calm after giving someone you love... so much trouble ?

590
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,900
Everything will end.
